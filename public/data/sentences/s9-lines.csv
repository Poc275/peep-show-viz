0,0,1,Jeremy,True,29,"God, I'm nervous, I haven't seen Mark for six months. Hope he's not too horrible. Maybe he'll have forgotten I tried to steal his girlfriend? I pretty much have."
1,1,1,Jeremy,True,10,"Here we go. Mr. Big, the ex-provider of my cheddar."
2,2,1,Jeremy,False,5,Mark. Good to see you.
3,3,1,Jeremy,False,1,So.
4,4,1,Jeremy,True,9,Going to relax this shit out with a lean.
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, so how's yous?"
6,6,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Right, that's good that you're happy."
7,7,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, right."
8,8,1,Jeremy,True,5,The Elephant Man never forgets.
9,9,1,Jeremy,True,15,"Oh, my God, he's cleaned up for the wedding. Iggy's gone to rehab, sober Hans."
10,10,1,Jeremy,True,15,"This stag is one load of PG-rated, Disney-assed, Which? Magazine approved, childproof, high-vitamin fucking bullshit."
11,11,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Yeah, after you've had three or four really big juices..."
12,12,1,Jeremy,False,6,I would think it'd degenerate soon.
13,13,1,Jeremy,True,14,"Oh, pissing pure Innocent smoothie, there's no way we can talk more about juice."
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,3,One little siparoo?
15,15,1,Jeremy,True,11,"That's right, get that big, old whistle really nice and wet."
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,2,Probably never.
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,12,What are your actual chances of making a living as an artist?
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Exactly, not very high."
19,19,1,Jeremy,False,5,"All in good time, Hans."
20,20,1,Jeremy,False,28,"Look, I'm a life coach, so when I say ""sometimes you have to kill a dream to follow a dream"", that's advice backed by a professional standards body."
21,21,1,Jeremy,True,10,"Mm, I've said body, she'll be thinking about my body."
22,22,1,Jeremy,False,4,I knew it would.
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,4,"She's not here, Hans."
24,24,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Everyone does. But they're indestructible, so we are stuck with them."
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Yep, oh yep."
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Come on through. It's a great space, extremely versatile."
27,27,1,Jeremy,False,25,"The humidity is actually great for my chest. I mean, it's not number one Hyde Park Palace, but it suits me down to the ground."
28,28,1,Jeremy,False,8,I think of it as a sunken bed.
29,29,1,Jeremy,False,37,"Don't even need to leave the tub. Drink from the tap, and when I need to, just push the bag down, bang, the bog's right there. Just kneel and piss directly down the plughole. It's my system."
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,10,And you haven't even seen the kitchen. I love it.
31,31,1,Jeremy,False,21,"Oh, right, yeah, no problem, wicked. Will it be a longy or a shorty? No worries, you decide. Take your time."
32,32,1,Jeremy,False,9,"That is the one small downside, but it's cool."
33,33,1,Jeremy,True,11,"There he goes, my other half, my better half, 'er indoors."
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Mark, we need to talk, there's something I need to say to you."
35,35,1,Jeremy,False,4,But maybe not here.
36,36,1,Jeremy,True,37,"""Sorry Mark"", ""I'm sorry."" So simple, and yet it feels like if I say it, I might actually die. OK, no need for an apology now, I'm back in. We'll just pick up where we left off."
37,37,1,Jeremy,False,1,Jerry?
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,2,The bank?
39,39,1,Jeremy,False,1,Johnson?
40,40,1,Jeremy,True,12,"The El Dude Brothers trump the Rebound Brothers, you total fucking arsehole."
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,6,Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
42,42,1,Jeremy,False,5,"He's using my mug, Mark."
43,43,1,Jeremy,True,8,"I don't know why, but I hate Jerry."
44,44,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Hey, that's my duvet!"
45,45,1,Jeremy,True,6,"I'm out, Jerry's in, apology redundant."
46,46,1,Jeremy,False,6,Pretty sure that is my duvet.
47,47,1,Jeremy,False,2,That's it.
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,11,No. I'll give you a twatting at Operation if you like.
49,49,1,Jeremy,False,38,"Look, Mark, I know what you're getting at, but the fact is, that day with Dobby I had a... a medical brain attack. I've got a note from the doctor, somewhere. If I could find the bloody thing."
50,50,1,Jeremy,True,11,"Fine, I'll go, but before I do, I'm reclaiming the Falklands."
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Taking my duvet, if that's cool."
52,52,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Fuck Jerry, it's mine."
53,53,1,Jeremy,True,37,"Another night in the bath. I really don't think you could call my life a failure. Look at that, I've got a sleeping bag and a duvet. If this was the olden days, I'd be a billionaire."
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh man, so you're in the shit."
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,30,"The coke? Yes, yes, it's mine. I brought some coke to the stag, and er, even though Hans asked me not to, and er, but he refused to have any."
56,56,1,Jeremy,False,6,Because he took it off me.
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,12,"Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm a spiker, it's just one of my things."
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,8,"I guess I'm just a terrible, terrible shithead."
59,59,1,Jeremy,False,21,"Can't I stay one more night? After everything I've done for you? Not just in the past, but like really recently."
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,1,Mark?
61,61,1,Jeremy,False,32,"I felt a bit bad about the other night, so I got you a biscuit. I mean, they call them cookies, but I know you prefer me to call it a biscuit."
62,62,1,Jeremy,False,3,Is that good?
63,63,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Three grand, free?"
64,64,1,Jeremy,False,10,But I get it without having to give you anything?
65,65,1,Jeremy,False,6,"So basically, it is free, really."
66,66,1,Jeremy,False,3,That sounds good.
67,67,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Ooh, I've got a credit rating."
68,68,1,Jeremy,False,37,"Great. And now I'm all signed up, could we have a chat about living arrangements? Yeah, I've moved out of Hans'. So yeah, I'm considering something really exciting, a night in one of the Royal Parks. Unless..."
69,69,1,Jeremy,False,16,"No, great, good. I'll be fine in the park till the loan comes through. Anyway, thanks."
70,70,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, hello, Mark. Got time for a chat?"
71,71,1,Jeremy,True,15,"Look out, Mark, my brain's got something in it, and you don't know what something."
72,72,1,Jeremy,False,22,"Yes, so, Mark, did you know that every time you play Candy Crush on your phone you sent out a Facebook invitation?"
73,73,1,Jeremy,False,17,I don't think you know your settings very well. You're pumping out invites every time you play.
74,74,1,Jeremy,False,4,That happens a lot.
75,75,1,Jeremy,False,21,"Mm, it just tends to happen to people who have just sent pictures of their cock on Twitter. They're all hacked."
76,76,1,Jeremy,False,74,"Look, the problem for you is I'm your friend. I know you, Mark. I know you like to pretend that you're this stuffed shirt who reads incredibly boring books about dead people killing each other with bayonets and typhoid, but I know the truth. I've watched Grand Designs with you. That smile when some eco-glass gets delayed on its way from Antwerp and the nice couple gets pushed over budget. That's the real you."
77,77,1,Jeremy,False,26,"You're this pathetic human who likes Twirls and Downton and Bond and burgers, so don't come the big guy with me, because it won't fucking wash."
78,78,1,Jeremy,False,2,After you.
79,79,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, well, I haven't got Mr. Nice with me."
80,80,1,Jeremy,False,40,"There's a hell of a lot to it. And when I read it I'm usually extremely high, which makes it better, but also means that I've forgotten most of it, which is actually great because then it never gets boring."
81,81,1,Jeremy,True,13,"Come on, nerd, raise the drawbridge. King Jeremy's coming back to his castle."
82,82,1,Jeremy,False,5,Lovely and warm in here.
83,83,1,Jeremy,False,9,"I take it you're a twenty-three degree guy, Terry."
84,84,1,Jeremy,False,1,Whatever.
85,85,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Mm, must be awkward for Mark. He's a real twenty-one degree-er."
86,86,1,Jeremy,False,18,"Twenty-three versus twenty-one, it's like Israel versus Palestine, isn't it? The endless beef. There's really no possible compromise."
87,87,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Twenty-two, yeah good, that's good. Both one degree uncomfortable."
88,88,1,Jeremy,False,34,"Jerry said he doesn't want coffee. He said he'd make his own later. He said, like he was joking, that your coffee tastes like horse piss. But I don't think he was really joking."
89,89,1,Jeremy,False,5,And then he hit me.
90,90,1,Jeremy,False,18,"Look, Mark, you need to face facts. Jerry's a wanker. Kick him out and kick me back in."
91,91,1,Jeremy,False,2,Why not?
92,92,1,Jeremy,False,5,Is this the Dobby thing?
93,93,1,Jeremy,False,3,But is it?
94,94,1,Jeremy,False,3,I knew it!
95,95,1,Jeremy,False,8,"So, what do you want me to do?"
96,96,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Fine! Obviously, I think we're both very sorry about what happened."
97,97,1,Jeremy,False,5,"I'm really, really sorry, Mark."
98,98,1,Jeremy,False,2,I'm sorry.
99,99,1,Jeremy,False,12,"All right, fine. I admit I shouldn't have come on your picnic."
100,100,1,Jeremy,False,6,"What? Look, I'm sorry, all right?"
101,101,1,Jeremy,False,21,"And if you like, I'll lay it on with a trowel and tell you how I like you, I value you..."
102,102,1,Jeremy,False,2,And even-
103,103,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, thank you."
104,104,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Well, maybe I can help with that."
105,105,1,Jeremy,False,32,"Yeah, listen, I'm afraid I have an announcement to make. I've discovered that in order to keep himself interested with all this garbage he pretends to like, Jerry drugs his head off."
106,106,1,Jeremy,False,14,I saw you put something in your pocket. I didn't like what I saw.
107,107,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Coke, Mark. Jerry is a cokehead who loves to take coke."
108,108,1,Jeremy,False,11,"I took it out, which is a very, very different thing."
109,109,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, what a terrible thing to accuse me of."
110,110,1,Jeremy,True,4,"Yes, you bloody can."
111,111,1,Jeremy,False,4,What about going Litvinenko?
112,112,1,Jeremy,False,38,"Not full Litvinenko. Just a little bit of something debilitating in his pasta each night. Grind him down, weaken him, till he's all pathetic and you can just scoop him up like a sick whippet and dump him."
113,113,1,Jeremy,False,12,You might quite like tending him as he grows weaker and weaker.
114,114,1,Jeremy,False,22,"Oh, do sit up, Jerry, while I spoon you some more of this slightly silvery porridge. Should I keep my voice down?"
115,115,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Well, we could start by just moving his stuff out."
116,116,1,Jeremy,False,6,"OK, we're nearly there. Last two."
117,117,1,Jeremy,False,7,"It's fine, Mark. It's like a prank."
118,118,1,Jeremy,False,12,I thought it might be a good idea to have some backup.
119,119,1,Jeremy,False,18,We could tie him to a hot air balloon. Then he would drift away out of the window.
120,120,1,Jeremy,False,7,You like that? The hot air balloon?
121,121,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Or punch him, Hans?"
122,122,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Psychological warfare. Yeah, grind him down. Attack his beliefs."
123,123,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Or, he is sort of... bagged for our convenience."
124,124,1,Jeremy,False,10,We could just bag him up and sling him out.
125,125,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Bag him, Hans."
126,126,1,Jeremy,False,3,The normal way?
127,127,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Put him in the lift, Hans."
128,128,1,Jeremy,False,6,Should I give him a kick?
129,129,1,Jeremy,False,6,Shut it or you're getting waterboarded.
130,130,1,Jeremy,False,4,I warned you. Waterboard!
131,131,1,Jeremy,True,7,"I'm back, baby. The bitch is back."
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Mark, can I put the heating on? I'm freezing."
133,133,2,Jeremy,False,17,You want me to stride about the flat covered in wool simply to stay alive? New York?
134,134,2,Jeremy,False,17,"This is your perfect way of going out with someone, isn't it? Safe in your sexual GCHQ?"
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Fascinating, here's a radical idea. Why don't you stop being a psycho and give her a ring?"
136,136,2,Jeremy,False,3,The million-text month?
137,137,2,Jeremy,False,10,I find it makes for a more conducive life-coaching environment.
138,138,2,Jeremy,True,16,"Than you at my place, my socks on the radiator and me sitting on a bongo."
139,139,2,Jeremy,True,41,"Megan's so lovely. I'm definitely falling in love with her. But what the hell's she talking about? Focus. I need to give her a really useful, usable bit of actual handcrafted wisdom that, ooh, is that Watchmen? I never saw Watchmen."
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, hey, Joe."
141,141,2,Jeremy,True,12,He's eyeing me. There's an atmosphere. Does he want to hit me?
142,142,2,Jeremy,True,3,"Fuck, did I?"
143,143,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Sure, big call."
144,144,2,Jeremy,False,19,"Hey, less of the old, young man. I'm still young enough to give you a bloody good duffing up."
145,145,2,Jeremy,True,36,"We're not going to fight, but I reckon I could duff him up, if I needed to. Take him out, take him apart, sort him out big-time. I could take him, definitely. If I needed to."
146,146,2,Jeremy,True,37,"Need to professionalise in here. Lose the lions, put up my certificate, get a filing cabinet. Except, have I got anything to f- What is that? Wait, is that a fucking thermometer? He's finally bloody lost it."
147,147,2,Jeremy,False,1,Hello.
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,4,What are you doing?
149,149,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
150,150,2,Jeremy,True,7,"He's in his jacket, going to everything."
151,151,2,Jeremy,False,7,"So, off you go, the ""best man""."
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,19,"The single best man there is. You know they haven't even invited me to the ceremony, just the reception."
153,153,2,Jeremy,False,5,You can't even say it.
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, hey, Mark. How's the advance party going?"
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Er, yeah, well, it was quite a warm day here."
156,156,2,Jeremy,False,1,Microclimate.
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Well, that would explain why I'm feeling quite chilly now."
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,1,Brrrr.
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,7,"How could it look warm, you maniac?"
160,160,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, that'll be the Isis guys that I've invited round to charge their mobiles on your coin."
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, hi."
162,162,2,Jeremy,False,1,Sure.
163,163,2,Jeremy,True,8,"Hey, I know what the weird atmosphere is."
164,164,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, sure."
165,165,2,Jeremy,True,22,"Just watching TV with a guy. It's like watching TV with Mark. Except, generally, I don't have Mark's jizz on my leg."
166,166,2,Jeremy,False,1,Er.
167,167,2,Jeremy,True,22,"Cuddling up all night with Joe, as if we were boyfriend and boyfriend? Am I going to go the full three dimensions?"
168,168,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Love to, but I've got to get on a coach, to Norfolk. It's, best friend's wedding."
169,169,2,Jeremy,False,24,"Yeah, got to go. Can't hang around here cuddling all night long. Got to get on a night coach to King's Lynn, my friend."
170,170,2,Jeremy,True,114,"The tinny vibration, God, that's annoying. That has got to hurt. I'm aggressively glancing, constant eye flicks and no smile. Man, he's got to be hurting. This is inhuman, I'm slaying him. What the hell am I doing in this horrible coach instead of spooning with a lovely guy? Do I love Joe? Do I love Megan? Do I love this guy sitting next to me? Am I a guy who just slept with a guy, which is fine, or am I a guy who is a gay guy, which is also fine, or am I a guy who sometimes sleeps with guys and sometimes doesn't? Which is also fine. It's all totally fine."
171,171,2,Jeremy,False,1,Hey.
172,172,2,Jeremy,False,5,How's the Dobby mission going?
173,173,2,Jeremy,False,29,"I hate it when that happens. Yeah, so, um, I know we don't have that many heart-to-heart chats, but, um, there's something I need to talk to you about."
174,174,2,Jeremy,False,25,"Look, you're the last person who I would ideally talk to about this, but the fact is, this will come as something of a shock."
175,175,2,Jeremy,False,12,"Earlier tonight, I had sex with a man in my bedroom, and-"
176,176,2,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah, and I have feelings for this guy Joe, but I kind of walked out on him and-"
177,177,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Yes, Mark. Anyway, um, as I was saying, I really like this guy-"
178,178,2,Jeremy,False,19,I'm talking about possibly the biggest thing that's ever happened in my life and you're obsessing about... room-al geography?
179,179,2,Jeremy,False,25,"I thought I was just totally open, totally cool, but now I wonder if inside, I don't have some shame or confusion deep in there."
180,180,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Normal, unheated, regular air temperature."
181,181,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, Dobs."
182,182,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Dobby, are you all right?"
183,183,2,Jeremy,False,5,Did you-? Do you... know?
184,184,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, my God, you watched me-"
185,185,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Yes, how do you-?"
186,186,2,Jeremy,False,3,Him as well?
187,187,2,Jeremy,False,10,I didn't know your room was bristling with surveillance equipment!
188,188,2,Jeremy,False,1,Hans.
189,189,2,Jeremy,False,31,"God, has the entire world seen this fucking video? I came here to talk to someone about this, get some perspective. Turns out I can just read the fucking YouTube comments."
190,190,2,Jeremy,True,25,"First mistake, no bouncers at the wedding. I'm in. Plus, the great thing is, I've escaped the strong, comforting arms of the sexy, affectionate man."
191,191,2,Jeremy,True,11,I think he might be the opposite of all those words.
192,192,2,Jeremy,False,5,But I've got nothing prepared.
193,193,2,Jeremy,False,222,"Hans. Super Hans, I've known Hans for many a year now. It's been a long road and now, as you've found Molly, er, and I don't really want to get into this, but I've started it now, but I'm going to bring it round, so don't worry. People said Molly wasn't right for you. That she was a downer. But you know what? If someone loves someone, he just loves them. And if that person is considered to be a downer, or even a yawn-a-thon, who cares? And even if someone loves another man, or, what's in a name? Or gender? Is it possible to love two people at once? Three? Four is surely the limit. But is it? What is love anyway? Is it, er, an act, or a feeling or, who am I to speak? Who are you to listen? Why is a marriage a marriage? But society says it's wrong for two men to love one another even though now it says it says that now it's OK? Is it OK because society says it's OK? What next? Dogs getting married? Could I marry my own son? No. Possibly not? Correct. Or is it? What I'm trying to say is that people should do whatever they want to do, at a temperature that suits them, within limits. Thank you."
194,194,2,Jeremy,True,34,"Pretty sure someone's going to print that speech on a tea towel someday. Yeah, eat that, Obama. Fuck off, Mandela. Take that, Mark, I'm the best man. I'm the best man who ever lived."
195,195,3,Jeremy,False,3,Can't handle it?
196,196,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Your word, not mine."
197,197,3,Jeremy,False,27,"I don't fit into your tiny little boxes. I'm just looking for that sacred connection, and for that, I'd fuck any single member of the human race."
198,198,3,Jeremy,False,20,"You know, I've always been a bit gay. I've always liked a bit of that. Like with Pej in Darty."
199,199,3,Jeremy,False,18,"We used to get pissed and pull each other off. Didn't you? You should have, it was great."
200,200,3,Jeremy,False,37,"The thing about sex with a guy, it's like getting your car fixed at the actual dealership. They've got all the codes, and you just plug right in. I mean, you like blow jobs, don't you, Mark?"
201,201,3,Jeremy,False,23,"Course you do. But, what's the most blowjobs you've ever had in one day? Like in the first happy days of a relationship?"
202,202,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Right. Well, my life now is a twenty-four seven blowjob bonanza."
203,203,3,Jeremy,False,22,"Put it this way, I'm moving out and I've got a new address for you to forward my post to, Blowjob City."
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Cool, um, here's that Beastie Boys CD I was telling you about."
205,205,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, yeah. Well, download the shit out of them, they're cool."
206,206,3,Jeremy,False,1,Bye.
207,207,3,Jeremy,False,19,"I really like him, Mark. Do you think it matters if I'm not young, dumb and full of cum?"
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,29,"Yeah, except I'm not that intelligent because I don't really understand almost any of what the news is about, and I'm not even certain that I'm full of cum."
209,209,3,Jeremy,False,4,"That's nice, thank you."
210,210,3,Jeremy,True,12,"Yeah, that will happen when he's busy sucking off your life coach."
211,211,3,Jeremy,False,1,No.
212,212,3,Jeremy,False,25,"The point is, you do your thing, yeah? And let him do his thing, and don't talk about upsetting shit. That's the key to happiness."
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,4,I'm a straight shooter.
214,214,3,Jeremy,True,5,And I'm fucking your boyfriend.
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,4,Time's up I think.
216,216,3,Jeremy,True,4,"No, don't call him."
217,217,3,Jeremy,True,4,"Yeah, lock him out."
218,218,3,Jeremy,True,9,"She's sexy, artistic, confused. It'd be rude not to."
219,219,3,Jeremy,False,19,"I have to say, this is the first time I've ever betrayed the ethics of my life coaching organisation."
220,220,3,Jeremy,False,23,"Yeah, I mean, I bet it's fine if football coaches have sex with their players, so long as it's outside the coaching window."
221,221,3,Jeremy,True,15,"Oh, I'd love to hang out with Joe. But maybe tonight isn't the best night."
222,222,3,Jeremy,True,33,"I'm creating my own work, I'm living off my own mess. Like when they fed all the cows to the other cows in the 90s and we got, what was it? Super burgers?"
223,223,3,Jeremy,False,27,"Whatever, it'll start with half an hour of adverts which everyone sits through like obedient disciples of the capitalist dictatorship. What the hell are you even doing?"
224,224,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Making hummus he says, like it's perfectly natural. No one makes hummus."
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,11,What are you gonna do next? Start making your own pasta?
226,226,3,Jeremy,False,13,"Jesus, Mark. Jamie Oliver and Sainsbury's make the food, we eat the food."
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,24,The girl from the shoe shop? You finally tracked her down and you're luring her back to your lair to eat her with pasta?
228,228,3,Jeremy,False,6,"Finally, I'm rubbing off on you."
229,229,3,Jeremy,False,13,"Wow, you should go the full Indy. ""I love you"" on the eyelids."
230,230,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Go on, it'll be hilarious."
231,231,3,Jeremy,False,7,"More than hilarious, it'd be a hoot."
232,232,3,Jeremy,False,17,Not on my watch. Come on. You've tracked down the love of your life. Go for it!
233,233,3,Jeremy,False,27,"Yes, Mark. This is what real friends are for. Making you do brilliant things that you'd never do otherwise. This is how the El Dude Brothers roll."
234,234,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Right then, hold still. Come on, Mark."
235,235,3,Jeremy,False,1,Megan!
236,236,3,Jeremy,True,14,"Oh no, Joe in the bedroom, Megan in the hallway. I'm playing genital Jenga."
237,237,3,Jeremy,False,6,"Good to see you, it's just-"
238,238,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Megan, Joe popped over. What a fun coincidence."
239,239,3,Jeremy,False,8,"No, he came round for a friendly visit."
240,240,3,Jeremy,False,13,"No, no. These are both just friendly coincidental visits. How lucky and brilliant."
241,241,3,Jeremy,True,20,This party needs to break up fast. How? Fire? Use a lighter to start a little fire in the hall?
242,242,3,Jeremy,False,6,"I'll be in, in a minute."
243,243,3,Jeremy,True,19,"OK, let's get the fuck out. A run? Yeah, let's go for a totally normal Saturday night three-person run."
244,244,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Can you smell, like, smoke?"
245,245,3,Jeremy,False,11,No? Maybe I'm not feeling very well. Perhaps you guys should-
246,246,3,Jeremy,False,6,That might not be so convenient.
247,247,3,Jeremy,False,6,What the hell are you doing?
248,248,3,Jeremy,False,10,"You didn't mention the husband, you dark, filthy, dirty horse."
249,249,3,Jeremy,False,2,Bulky lettuce?
250,250,3,Jeremy,False,2,What cocktail?
251,251,3,Jeremy,False,16,"Mr. Patel's? Austerity corn flakes and Latvian feta? Look, here we go. Beans, everyone likes beans."
252,252,3,Jeremy,False,4,Beans are pasta sauce.
253,253,3,Jeremy,False,2,They're tomatoey.
254,254,3,Jeremy,False,12,It is when I make pasta. What the hell are you doing?
255,255,3,Jeremy,False,5,With your disgusting human fingers?
256,256,3,Jeremy,True,8,"That's not Nigella. that's not even Ainsley, mate."
257,257,3,Jeremy,False,4,What are you doing?
258,258,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Good, it's like Whose Pasta Is It Anyway, yeah?"
259,259,3,Jeremy,False,11,"I dunno, they're always good, eggs, aren't they? Till they hatch."
260,260,3,Jeremy,False,9,"You know what, maybe it's fine. Is it... Moroccan?"
261,261,3,Jeremy,True,6,"Yeah, Morocco. Anything goes in Morocco."
262,262,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Exactly, that's the dinner party spirit. Fuck them all. Listen, Mark, the pasta will be fine. It'll all be fine."
263,263,3,Jeremy,False,14,"Absolutely. Although, I would recommend getting rid of the love message on your eyes."
264,264,3,Jeremy,True,3,"Ugh, lid scour."
265,265,3,Jeremy,False,2,Not exactly.
266,266,3,Jeremy,False,5,I might've used permanent marker.
267,267,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Good idea. Although eyes, bleach, is that a bad one?"
268,268,3,Jeremy,True,3,Oh my God.
269,269,3,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, that'll work."
270,270,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, mate."
271,271,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Look, you probably need to know. Joe thinks Megan's fucking around on him, and Megan thinks Joe's fucking around on her."
272,272,3,Jeremy,False,20,"And I happen to know that they're both right, because I've sort of ended up sleeping with both of them."
273,273,3,Jeremy,False,18,"To be honest, it's getting quite tiring, especially when I have to do them both in one day."
274,274,3,Jeremy,False,36,"Yeah, on the plus side, she's fucking around on him and he's fucking around on her, so if they find out about each other, then I don't see that they can make much of a fuss."
275,275,3,Jeremy,True,2,"Civilisation, schmivilisation."
276,276,3,Jeremy,True,14,"Oh yeah, that's right. Always rely on Jez for a chuckle. I'll show them."
277,277,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Can I ask you a question, Angus, of a theological nature?"
278,278,3,Jeremy,False,5,Did Jesus have a cat?
279,279,3,Jeremy,False,6,If you don't know just say.
280,280,3,Jeremy,False,15,"I do find it interesting that all you pointy heads, living inside your Westminster bubble-"
281,281,3,Jeremy,False,18,"People like you in your ivory towers, who are like, who gives a fuck about the real issues?"
282,282,3,Jeremy,True,15,"This is a disaster. Joe thinks I'm an idiot. I'm not an idiot, I'm Paxman."
283,283,3,Jeremy,False,24,"To be honest, uh, I've never really got it about Jesus. I mean, apart from all the Christian stuff, what did Jesus actually do?"
284,284,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, put that aside."
285,285,3,Jeremy,False,31,"I'm not knocking the guy. I'm just saying, you know, apart from that, what did he actually achieve? I'm not saying I like him but at least Hitler did some paintings."
286,286,3,Jeremy,True,31,"Ooh, hello! Naughty, naughty Megan. Am I betraying Joe or Megan more? I like him loads, but I'm her life coach. What the fuck? Joe! No, don't cross the streams, shit!"
287,287,3,Jeremy,False,11,"That was actually Mark's foot, he does that sometimes, for laughs."
288,288,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Put your foot in my groin, under the table."
289,289,3,Jeremy,False,15,"He's quick, he slips them on and off. It's part of our flirty, dirty game."
290,290,3,Jeremy,False,6,I might leave them to it.
291,291,3,Jeremy,True,7,"Oh, the Corrigan stare. The full Paddington."
292,292,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Ingenious, but totally mental."
293,293,3,Jeremy,False,5,"So, we've got good news."
294,294,3,Jeremy,False,11,We're looking a the possibility of moving forward as a three.
295,295,3,Jeremy,False,10,"A very respectful, very boundaried, rather horny triangle with guidelines."
296,296,3,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh, I thought Joe was staying here tonight, um, according to the guidelines."
297,297,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Right, but you spent last night together. Um, ""on no two consecutive nights shall..."" et cetera, et cetera."
298,298,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh OK. Well then, yeah-"
299,299,3,Jeremy,False,15,"I mean, I guess it's up to Joe, is it? Is there a rule for..?"
300,300,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh, everything was all right when you were humping two people, but when I started, that's not allowed."
301,301,3,Jeremy,False,10,"No, I won't fucking admit it because it's not true."
302,302,4,Jeremy,True,11,Gorgeous Joe. I want to crawl inside your lovely pink mouth.
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, yeah, of course. Me too. Busy, busy, busy."
304,304,4,Jeremy,True,8,"Storage Wars, Walnut Whip, wank into a flannel."
305,305,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Uh, I would probably have to say..."
306,306,4,Jeremy,True,8,"think of someone famous, think of someone famous."
307,307,4,Jeremy,False,2,...the Queen.
308,308,4,Jeremy,True,2,Interesting choice.
309,309,4,Jeremy,False,20,"Yeah. It was either the Queen, or, Jenson Button, but, in the end, I'd probably have to say the Queen."
310,310,4,Jeremy,False,14,It wasn't just me. A small cadre of life coaches were airlifted into Highgrove.
311,311,4,Jeremy,False,16,"She is... outlandish. She's funny. She's saucy and she's got the filthiest laugh. Kind of... ""uh-he-huh-huh-huh-huh""."
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh Joe. Oh, I have an office, obvs."
313,313,4,Jeremy,False,13,"It's... you know the office block on the corner of, er, Cowper Street?"
314,314,4,Jeremy,True,1,Oh.
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,10,"You do? Great. Yeah, well, I have a place there."
316,316,4,Jeremy,False,4,Yep. You do that.
317,317,4,Jeremy,True,26,"This is just another small, insignificant lie I'll have to maintain until the day I die. Mark still thinks I know what the public sector is."
318,318,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, this is just one thing after a-bloody-nother."
319,319,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Actually, I'm probably going to go."
320,320,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Ooh, are we gonna win the match? What if we lose the match? The match, the match, the match!"
321,321,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Fine. If it comes at me again, I'm not hitting it."
322,322,4,Jeremy,False,22,"Can I go now? 'Cause I am only here so you can fuck the historian, and I really don't see that happening."
323,323,4,Jeremy,True,9,Fuck tennis! It's basically bullshit ping pong for giants.
324,324,4,Jeremy,False,5,How are you feeling today?
325,325,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Why is that, do you think?"
326,326,4,Jeremy,False,1,Interesting.
327,327,4,Jeremy,True,7,"Hunker down, Jeremy, into the brain bunker."
328,328,4,Jeremy,False,8,"OK, that's all we've got time for today."
329,329,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Let's just dive back in, shall we?"
330,330,4,Jeremy,True,4,Back into the cesspool.
331,331,4,Jeremy,True,8,"Walnut Whip, little cry, wank into a flannel."
332,332,4,Jeremy,False,18,"God, that's romantic, Mark. What next? Take her up in a hot-air balloon and get your anuses bleached?"
333,333,4,Jeremy,False,17,"Mark, can I ask you something? And I want you to be honest. Am I a shit?"
334,334,4,Jeremy,False,6,So I am? I'm a shit?
335,335,4,Jeremy,False,4,I'm a total shit?
336,336,4,Jeremy,False,5,"What a total, total shit!"
337,337,4,Jeremy,False,8,"I need to get my act together, Mark."
338,338,4,Jeremy,False,20,"I'm just a waster, floating through life, jazzing into the flannel. And Joe, he's like this great guy, cool job-"
339,339,4,Jeremy,False,33,"Oh don't be so fucking parochial, Mark. I'm laying it out there. The inner churn, the workings of man, and you're hung up on whose jizz ends up on what bit of cloth."
340,340,4,Jeremy,False,13,I don't know! I can't be expected to remember where it all goes.
341,341,4,Jeremy,False,38,"You know what? You're right. I've gone too far this time, Mark. Well, I am turning a corner. I'm growing up and getting an actual office and I'm gonna stop just flinging my jizz around hither and yon."
342,342,4,Jeremy,False,7,"So, where's this gastro pub, then, Hans?"
343,343,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Doesn't look very gastro, Hans. There's a man over there eating Quavers out of an ashtray."
344,344,4,Jeremy,False,26,"Oh, is this about your self-esteem? Yeah? 'Cause I always think self-esteem is a lot like actual steam. You can't see it, but it definitely exists."
345,345,4,Jeremy,False,3,"What's that, sorry?"
346,346,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Super Hans, quick natter?"
347,347,4,Jeremy,False,6,Is he a fucking bank robber?
348,348,4,Jeremy,False,10,"I've been burned before, Hans. Never trust the pub man."
349,349,4,Jeremy,False,7,You've just got back from your honeymoon?
350,350,4,Jeremy,False,8,I don't like it. It smells of crime.
351,351,4,Jeremy,False,2,Five figures?
352,352,4,Jeremy,False,3,So three figures?
353,353,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Sorry, Hans, I'm out. I'm getting my shit together."
354,354,4,Jeremy,False,51,"Yeah. I need quite a lot of storage space for my personal effects when hiring an office, 'cause I've ordered a briefcase off Amazon. It's coming from Holland. What's- oh, my God! There's a socket in the floor! Unbelievable! Um, do you monitor the things I look at on the internet?"
355,355,4,Jeremy,False,5,Great! I love this office.
356,356,4,Jeremy,False,6,Four? Four hundred? Fuck my mouth!
357,357,4,Jeremy,False,6,"So, Mark, I got your letter."
358,358,4,Jeremy,False,13,Do you have any idea of the monthly repayments on that fucking thing?
359,359,4,Jeremy,False,33,"So that's it? Office gone. There's no way I can afford it any more. All my hopes and dreams, everything I've been working for, for the last thirty-nine years flushed down the toilet."
360,360,4,Jeremy,False,23,"You never should have sold me that loan, Mark. You were exploiting me. Well, guess what? I've got one word for you. Ombudsman."
361,361,4,Jeremy,False,34,"I'm going to the ombudsman. So if there's a bang at the door and you answer it and there's a man in a stovepipe hat with a long, hooky stick, that's him. The ombudsman."
362,362,4,Jeremy,False,10,"One eye open, Mark. The ombudsman's coming to get you!"
363,363,4,Jeremy,False,5,I've got you the goods.
364,364,4,Jeremy,False,25,"But on one condition. Say pub man is a bank robber, we tell him, no shooting of Mark. And that is an absolute red line."
365,365,4,Jeremy,True,14,"God, I'm a good friend. I've really stuck my neck out for Mark there."
366,366,4,Jeremy,False,2,Like what?
367,367,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Hang on. But he's not actually going to do it, though?"
368,368,4,Jeremy,False,5,You said he was harmless.
369,369,4,Jeremy,False,23,"He's got a multiple personality disorder, basically. Shit! Right, text pub man, tell him not to shoot Mark. I've got to warn him."
370,370,4,Jeremy,True,20,"What if he's already shot him? What if he's wounded him? God, imagine Mark in a wheelchair. He'll be insufferable."
371,371,4,Jeremy,False,10,"Mark, I need five, like, quite intense minutes right now."
372,372,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Hi, Angus."
373,373,4,Jeremy,False,34,"Just FYI sort of thing, there is a very slim possibility that... a bank robber is heading into the bank right now. So, you know, act normal, but also be on permanent high alert."
374,374,4,Jeremy,False,10,"It's just some mate of Super Hans, some pub man."
375,375,4,Jeremy,False,14,"No, it's all fine, because I told Hans to tell him, ""No shooting Mark."""
376,376,4,Jeremy,False,7,"No, because it was a red line."
377,377,4,Jeremy,False,26,"Look, it's just a caper gone bad. He wanted your swipe card, and then I... took it, but then I didn't give it to him, and-"
378,378,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Come on, Mark, on your high horse. It's a bank. They're insured. It's a victimless crime."
379,379,4,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, how many times, Mark? You are not getting- you are not getting shot. Why does it always have to be about you?"
380,380,4,Jeremy,False,9,"In a way, you do work in a bank."
381,381,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Well, I mean, come on. You're probably due one."
382,382,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, shit!"
383,383,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Just fucking calm down, Mark, for fuck's sake!"
384,384,4,Jeremy,False,8,Will you stop panicking? He's just some nutter.
385,385,4,Jeremy,False,4,We need to leave.
386,386,4,Jeremy,False,31,"He won't. And if he does, what are we supposed to do? Stop him? Yeah, that's what we'll do, Mark, we'll stop him. We'll stop the armed maniac, me and you."
387,387,4,Jeremy,False,11,It's fine. Everything's going to be fine. No one's getting shot.
388,388,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Right, we need to move. He's quite obviously gonna shoot everyone."
389,389,4,Jeremy,False,18,"He's a cadaver, Mark. He's toast. Coffee shop. We'll wait in the coffee shop until the shooting stops."
390,390,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Macchiato and a blueberry muffin, please."
391,391,4,Jeremy,False,5,What difference does it make?
392,392,4,Jeremy,False,4,You know what... soz.
393,393,4,Jeremy,False,1,Joe?
394,394,4,Jeremy,False,1,Hey.
395,395,4,Jeremy,False,34,"Oh, uh... sorry. I can't really hear you. I- I'm just at Highgrove. Uh, in fact, Joe, there's a very distinguished older gentleman who'd really like to have a word with you right now."
396,396,4,Jeremy,False,4,Do a Prince Philip.
397,397,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Do a Prince Philip and I'll go and tackle the robber, or whatever."
398,398,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Uh, sorry about that, Joe. He's famously flighty."
399,399,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Uh, no. I'm actually at Balmoral and- Hello? Hello?"
400,400,4,Jeremy,False,11,He's gone. It's happening then. Joe's starting to see through me.
401,401,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Sorry, mate."
402,402,5,Jeremy,False,3,Ian coming over?
403,403,5,Jeremy,False,16,"I see you're sticking with ""the program"". Poor little bastard doesn't even get a Jaffa cake."
404,404,5,Jeremy,False,10,"When are you finally going to get your gratification, Mark?"
405,405,5,Jeremy,False,11,Ejaculate into a pile of M&S cashmere jumpers and cruise brochures.
406,406,5,Jeremy,False,5,All the Whores of Malta.
407,407,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, wow!"
408,408,5,Jeremy,False,3,Oh my God!
409,409,5,Jeremy,False,5,Mark! I've done a thing.
410,410,5,Jeremy,False,44,"Do you think when I do a search this will come up? 'Cause when Joe searched, nothing really came up apart from some shit I wrote in a forum about how Moby was overrated and should be killed and his DNA expunged from humanity."
411,411,5,Jeremy,False,12,"And you know, cold light of day, it looks a bit, much."
412,412,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Lyrics by Super Hans. Yeah, you did the lyrics solo, did you?"
413,413,5,Jeremy,True,3,"Definitely, definitely, didn't."
414,414,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, pretty sure I... helped."
415,415,5,Jeremy,False,24,"Oh, yeah it's cool but I just think, would it be cool to change the credit to a shared credit, though, do you think?"
416,416,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Cool, understood. But you'll have a word."
417,417,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, truth to power, my friend."
418,418,5,Jeremy,True,20,I need to get away and count my beans. I think he's trying to take some of my bloody beans.
419,419,5,Jeremy,False,31,I slept on it but actually I couldn't sleep because I became filled with this boiling feeling of rage and now I've actually decided it's the worst thing that ever happened.
420,420,5,Jeremy,False,24,Joe's beginning to realise that I'm a loser. It's very important that he doesn't realise that I'm a loser. Because I'm not a loser.
421,421,5,Jeremy,False,1,Yes.
422,422,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, not the IQ test. I wasn't concentrating."
423,423,5,Jeremy,False,19,I don't need to take a stupid IQ test to know that I'm three times as intelligent as you.
424,424,5,Jeremy,True,18,"Three hundreds and thirty and thirty and thirty. But then all the threes, is it a trick question?"
425,425,5,Jeremy,False,61,"Mark no one does maths these days. We've all got calculators in our pockets, just like all our maths teachers said we wouldn't. Anyway this proves nothing. Probably most people are below average. Oh, fuck. Hans says it can't be changed. Apparently, the net has run out of web space and they don't have enough bytes left to add my name."
426,426,5,Jeremy,False,6,This track is my Citizen Kane.
427,427,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Yes, those are my words."
428,428,5,Jeremy,False,19,I remember because I was reading the small print on a plane ticket when I came up with them.
429,429,5,Jeremy,False,29,Discovered them. Hang on! It was your plane ticket. You went into a rant about the Civil Aviation Authority and how ATOL protection wasn't something to make light of.
430,430,5,Jeremy,False,5,Yes! You've cracked the case.
431,431,5,Jeremy,False,15,You're not thinking of getting back with Sophie? A bit of a depressing backward step?
432,432,5,Jeremy,False,15,"It's the journey of life. Like Radio 1, Radio 2, Classic FM, Heart, Magic, dead."
433,433,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah. OK, you ready?"
434,434,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Hi Hans, I've brought you a Panettone."
435,435,5,Jeremy,False,7,I don't know you see them around.
436,436,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah and also, Mark had something to say."
437,437,5,Jeremy,False,3,I wrote it.
438,438,5,Jeremy,False,17,You can't remember jack shit because you're a crack head with a brain made of Swiss cheese.
439,439,5,Jeremy,False,8,We're gonna come for you in the night.
440,440,5,Jeremy,False,1,Wanker.
441,441,5,Jeremy,True,12,"Yeah, fuck off, Hans. you're the fifth Beatle. I'm the other four."
442,442,5,Jeremy,False,14,"Han's file, the proof! It's in there. And because I've got a genius IQ..."
443,443,5,Jeremy,False,8,I've cracked the code of the spare key.
444,444,5,Jeremy,False,14,"Here we go, Apple grievances, Lemmy, lyrics... nothing? Nothing at all. Right, fuck him."
445,445,5,Jeremy,True,7,Revenge. Revenge is the sexy man's justice.
446,446,5,Jeremy,False,18,Ooh! Someone who is expecting Corn Flakes is gonna get a big fucking malty hit of Shreddies. Boom.
447,447,5,Jeremy,False,25,"OK , I'm going to lick these apples and put his bank card in the freezer. You start swapping the CDs into the wrong cases."
448,448,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Wait, watch this."
449,449,5,Jeremy,False,11,It's the free gift that's gonna to send him clinically insane.
450,450,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Here, fishy?"
451,451,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Fishy, fishy."
452,452,5,Jeremy,False,13,Where would you go though if you could actually go back in time?
453,453,5,Jeremy,False,9,I think I'd probably go back to the 50s.
454,454,5,Jeremy,False,12,"So am I. Thick, thick shakes, real fat burgers, big Chevies, cheerleaders."
455,455,5,Jeremy,False,1,Nah.
456,456,5,Jeremy,False,15,If not the 50s then the 60s. See the Rolling Stones and have a Coke.
457,457,5,Jeremy,False,14,"I'm talking about seeing them in their prime, drinking Coke out of a bottle."
458,458,5,Jeremy,True,4,"Enjoy Cokeless Rome, dickhead!"
459,459,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Jesus, this is where we bring them now? The poor fuckers."
460,460,5,Jeremy,False,11,"I mean, God, net them up, bag 'em and tag 'em."
461,461,5,Jeremy,False,7,All I can think about is death.
462,462,5,Jeremy,False,26,"So, Sophie? Are you going to pull on the iron underpants, tie your knob to the Bosch and just run yourself over with the Morphy Richards?"
463,463,5,Jeremy,False,2,Corrigan classic.
464,464,5,Jeremy,False,3,The old familiar.
465,465,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Hey there, little guy! High five."
466,466,5,Jeremy,False,13,"Come on little fella, let uncle Jeremy put you in the rage cage."
467,467,5,Jeremy,False,8,Ian's in the fun pit working the plastics.
468,468,5,Jeremy,False,6,He's being detained at capitalism's pleasure.
469,469,5,Jeremy,False,9,"OK, you my friend are a stone cold maniac."
470,470,5,Jeremy,False,2,I'm broke.
471,471,5,Jeremy,False,11,It could weaken my claim. The claim must not be weakened.
472,472,5,Jeremy,False,9,In where? I don't know what you're talking about.
473,473,5,Jeremy,False,16,"OK, I need a little margin, collateral to stop Super Hans in his tracks. His... snake."
474,474,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, Mark, don't make this into a thing."
475,475,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Probably not. I picked it up with a oven glove, but it didn't look venomous."
476,476,5,Jeremy,False,12,It looked perfectly chilled out when I put it in the bag.
477,477,5,Jeremy,False,24,"It's fine. It's double-bagged. I'm gonna call Super Hans, get him to come over here and we'll settle this thing once and for all."
478,478,5,Jeremy,False,13,"He can't come at me in the kid farm, can he? It's perfect."
479,479,5,Jeremy,False,11,"I'll throw her in if you like, into the wipe-clean penitentiary."
480,480,5,Jeremy,False,20,"Hans, its Jez. Come and meet me at the Kid Kave. Just get to Thornton Heath and follow the screaming."
481,481,5,Jeremy,False,9,I was looking for you. Hayley's throwing a wobbly.
482,482,5,Jeremy,False,5,Where the hell were you?
483,483,5,Jeremy,False,34,"Mark! You are on fire today. Shall I alert all the other women in here in case you try and hump them or move in with them? So, what are you thinking? With Sophie?"
484,484,5,Jeremy,False,1,Exactly.
485,485,5,Jeremy,False,16,"That's the line. Yeah, do what you want mate, shovel the kid into the kid pit."
486,486,5,Jeremy,False,1,Dunno.
487,487,5,Jeremy,False,15,"I'm not a professional childminder, Mark. Anyway, I probably don't have a high enough IQ."
488,488,5,Jeremy,False,16,"Hump someone else's wife in the disabled toilet? I'm not a member of your entourage, Mark."
489,489,5,Jeremy,False,10,"Ooh, Mark mate, something wonky this way comes. Good luck."
490,490,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Well, I think she's a small-minded, two-faced buzz-killing machine."
491,491,5,Jeremy,False,9,She's decent though. She is. I've always said that.
492,492,5,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, wow! Thanks man, you put me on! Amazing. They found some more web space then?"
493,493,5,Jeremy,False,15,"And, have you been back to your flat since we spoke? Just out of interest."
494,494,5,Jeremy,False,15,"I kind of broke in, looking for evidence and I sort of... killed your fish."
495,495,5,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
496,496,5,Jeremy,False,19,I know. I'm sorry. I always liked Flop. And there's one other thing I did that I shouldn't have-
497,497,5,Jeremy,False,10,"No, No. I feel bad about this but I took."
498,498,5,Jeremy,True,2,Oh fuck.
499,499,5,Jeremy,False,2,I took...this.
500,500,5,Jeremy,False,10,Well no. They cost money and the bottom line is...
501,501,5,Jeremy,True,4,where's the fucking snake?
502,502,5,Jeremy,False,10,...it's your bag and I stole it and I feel...
503,503,5,Jeremy,True,5,where the fuck is he?
504,504,5,Jeremy,False,4,incredibly... ashamed of that.
505,505,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Hans, just caved. We won."
506,506,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Only downside is, the snake escaped."
507,507,5,Jeremy,False,9,I can't believe it would do that. So sneaky.
508,508,5,Jeremy,False,12,"The good news is, I googled it and it's totally not venomous."
509,509,5,Jeremy,False,4,What are you doing?
510,510,5,Jeremy,False,3,A famous paedo?
511,511,5,Jeremy,False,7,I think she might be balls deep.
512,512,5,Jeremy,False,4,"I mean, you could-"
513,513,5,Jeremy,False,16,I was gonna say wake her up and get her a coffee but... shallow ball grave?
514,514,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Well, don't fuck about if you're gonna bury her, bury her."
515,515,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Do you think she'll be able to breathe, in her grave?"
516,516,5,Jeremy,False,11,"OK, just push her head down, it's poking up a bit."
517,517,5,Jeremy,False,14,"There we go. She's gone. She's gone Mark. You're cool. Hey Mark, there's Ian."
518,518,5,Jeremy,False,1,Uh?
519,519,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Hey there, little buddy."
520,520,5,Jeremy,False,14,"It doesn't feel quite right, leaving a snake in a child's soft play area."
521,521,5,Jeremy,False,7,May be we should leave a note.
522,522,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Sorry, Snake?"
523,523,6,Jeremy,False,1,Perfect.
524,524,6,Jeremy,True,8,"So tired, so very tired. Must eat toast."
525,525,6,Jeremy,False,14,"I'm fine. I think I might shortly die, but I'm fine. Three-day drug binge."
526,526,6,Jeremy,False,9,"You're not planning a party or anything, are you?"
527,527,6,Jeremy,False,7,Cause I definitely don't want a party.
528,528,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Good, because I told Joe I'll be thirty-nine tomorrow."
529,529,6,Jeremy,False,25,"I don't know. Forty is basically fifty, and fifty is dead. Whereas thirty-nine is like thirty-five. Thirty-five is practically thirty. Thirty is twenty. You know?"
530,530,6,Jeremy,False,16,"He's thirty next year. For a few months, theoretically, we can be in our thirties together."
531,531,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Twenty-nine, forty? No. Twenty-nine, thirty-nine? OK. Thirty-one, forty-two? No. Sixteen, twenty-six? Better."
532,532,6,Jeremy,True,19,Right. I'm gonna have the most horribly healthy fucking lunch and then do a sit-up and maybe a press-up?
533,533,6,Jeremy,False,4,I need the vitamins.
534,534,6,Jeremy,False,14,Got to try and keep up with Joe. He's so fucking full of life.
535,535,6,Jeremy,False,18,"No, it's mine. It's about the beneficial properties of our body's most magnificent product, the human vitamin drink."
536,536,6,Jeremy,False,5,Urine is packed with nutrients.
537,537,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Why do the Uhamojo people live to a hundred, Mark?"
538,538,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Because they take the original vaccine, the watery battery, the mellow yellow."
539,539,6,Jeremy,False,7,"No, not the chocolate factory. That's horrible."
540,540,6,Jeremy,False,3,Best served chilled.
541,541,6,Jeremy,False,6,I thought you were off today?
542,542,6,Jeremy,False,17,Be quiet when you come back. I'm gonna pull myself off and sleep for a hundred years.
543,543,6,Jeremy,False,5,Mark? I'm trying to sleep.
544,544,6,Jeremy,False,14,"What? Oh, fuck! We don't hit. That's the rule. Or are we hitting now?"
545,545,6,Jeremy,True,10,"OK, I redunded him. He face ploughed me. We're equals-pequals."
546,546,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, not still with the silent treatment? For fuck's sake."
547,547,6,Jeremy,False,33,I didn't want you to get fired. I just wanted my extortionate payments written off. You're the one who sold me the ball-crushing loan in the first place. You started it. Hmm? Eh?
548,548,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Come on, let's have it out."
549,549,6,Jeremy,True,19,"This is unbearable. I'm gonna make him come out and fight like a man, push it to breaking point."
550,550,6,Jeremy,False,7,Can I have some of your milk?
551,551,6,Jeremy,False,15,Hmm? I'll take that as a yes. Do say when you want me to stop.
552,552,6,Jeremy,False,7,No? I'll fill her right up then.
553,553,6,Jeremy,False,13,"I'll just get rid of these. Oops, apologies. I'll just tidy these away."
554,554,6,Jeremy,True,19,What am I gonna do now? Cover him in milk and start licking him? I'm not gonna lick him.
555,555,6,Jeremy,True,5,He's never smelt of peppermint.
556,556,6,Jeremy,False,20,"Yeah, fine, knackered. Three-day bender. Then Mark got fired 'cause of me and I couldn't sleep 'cause of the guilt."
557,557,6,Jeremy,False,7,And now he's not speaking to me.
558,558,6,Jeremy,True,8,"Shush, Hans. I'm trying to think about myself."
559,559,6,Jeremy,False,27,"Hang on. Mark, did you piss in my piss? 'Cause this piss looks funny. I don't mind drinking my piss, but your piss, that's over the line."
560,560,6,Jeremy,False,4,"You all right, mate?"
561,561,6,Jeremy,False,14,"I'm sorry, Mark. I'm sorry your life is ruined and it's partly my fault."
562,562,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh God, don't be such a wanker."
563,563,6,Jeremy,False,2,Yes! Sorry.
564,564,6,Jeremy,False,20,"Look, mate. I can't just let you sit there feeling sorry for yourself. Let's bloody well go and stop her."
565,565,6,Jeremy,True,6,He's talking to me. I win!
566,566,6,Jeremy,False,33,"Mark, I'm gonna help you save the day with April. I am gonna be your love butler. Come on, let's at least go and spy? In case there's something to be done? Yeah?"
567,567,6,Jeremy,False,11,I know. You don't have to tell me after every sentence.
568,568,6,Jeremy,False,3,It is clear.
569,569,6,Jeremy,False,20,"You just need to be ready, Mark. Ready to get April on her own and tell her how you feel."
570,570,6,Jeremy,False,17,"If you want, I could try to get in there, waggle the old cock about a bit?"
571,571,6,Jeremy,False,18,I don't know. Maybe try and make Angus fall in love with me? Fuck him if need be.
572,572,6,Jeremy,False,4,It's just an idea.
573,573,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, body language doesn't look great."
574,574,6,Jeremy,False,17,"He's off. Closing time in the last chance saloon, Mark. Time to grab your nuts and splurge!"
575,575,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah!
576,576,6,Jeremy,False,3,"You go, girl!"
577,577,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Mark. How's it going, you lovely rotter?"
578,578,6,Jeremy,False,1,Excellent.
579,579,6,Jeremy,False,3,It'll be amazing.
580,580,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Man, that is so great. I am really happy for you. You deserve that."
581,581,6,Jeremy,False,7,"I wouldn't have expected you to, mate."
582,582,6,Jeremy,False,2,Eh! Eh!
583,583,6,Jeremy,False,5,"I've done something brilliant, Mark."
584,584,6,Jeremy,False,38,"I know it's my birthday, not yours, but I got you a lovely present, to say sorry. For making you lose your job, and never paying you any rent, and for falling in love with Dobby, for everything."
585,585,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh Angus, shush. Bants, mad bants!"
586,586,6,Jeremy,False,15,He greedily gulped from a bedside bottle that happened to be from the golden source.
587,587,6,Jeremy,False,12,Yes. I was worried Ibiza was too much. Was it too much?
588,588,6,Jeremy,False,13,I've done a good one. I've cleared the coast. The coast is clear.
589,589,6,Jeremy,False,37,"Or, did I invite an unstable oddball for a lift in Hans' van, then back to here for a snifter, then he accidentally got locked in my room for a few hours? It's our word against his."
590,590,6,Jeremy,False,11,This is brilliant and it totally worked. You're back with April.
591,591,6,Jeremy,False,7,The long term plan is sucky fucky.
592,592,6,Jeremy,False,27,"Look, how long's the cruise for? Months. Chuck her phone off the boat first day. Butter fingers. Then work on her, cement things. You're in pole position."
593,593,6,Jeremy,False,1,Exactly.
594,594,6,Jeremy,False,16,"No, Mark. Sail off into the sunset and let your love butler take care of business."
595,595,6,Jeremy,False,19,Correct decision. There's always a dark side of love. Someone's always gonna get a little bit kidnapped. Who's that?
596,596,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh for fuck's sake, Mark! I told you I didn't want a fucking surprise party!"
597,597,6,Jeremy,False,8,When have I ever hidden my true feelings?
598,598,6,Jeremy,False,4,Give him a poke.
599,599,6,Jeremy,False,28,Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. You're the British people. We're Blair and Bush. We'll do the rendition. You just have a glass of wine and pretend nothing's happening.
600,600,6,Jeremy,False,5,"All right, gag him, Hans."
601,601,6,Jeremy,False,1,Hi.
602,602,6,Jeremy,False,6,"The kangaroo is tied down, sport."
603,603,6,Jeremy,False,12,Why did you invite her? She hates me. I stole her boyfriend.
604,604,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh hi, Molly."
605,605,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, well, I'm definitely not."
606,606,6,Jeremy,False,1,Tickets?
607,607,6,Jeremy,False,13,"Stay up for a week. Oh right. So what, no sleeping at all?"
608,608,6,Jeremy,True,6,Which will be within a week.
609,609,6,Jeremy,True,5,Second year in a row.
610,610,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah, apparently. That's what the banner says."
611,611,6,Jeremy,False,13,"Did I? Yeah, maybe. I forget. Yeah, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, in that area."
612,612,6,Jeremy,False,6,It's not a big deal. Whatever.
613,613,6,Jeremy,False,5,I didn't. I just misspoke.
614,614,6,Jeremy,False,40,"Look, Joe, I'm sorry, but the truth is I'm forty, and I don't want to go raving for a week. I want to stay up till about one and then go to bed and listen to my Mr. Nice audiobook."
615,615,6,Jeremy,False,23,"It is, Joe. Look, I can't rave all day and fuck all night. And honestly, I don't even like drinking my own piss."
616,616,6,Jeremy,False,29,"Yes. I eat cashews and I drink my own piss and it doesn't work. I'm never gonna be young, dumb, and full of cum ever again and that's that."
617,617,6,Jeremy,False,13,"I want to come with you, but I'm just scared I might die."
618,618,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Joe. Don't go, Joe."
619,619,6,Jeremy,True,21,"Oh, I've driven him away with my horrible oldness. Yeah, Megan, you're twenty-nine now, but one day, you'll be like, fifty-six."
620,620,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Um, thanks, Mark."
621,621,6,Jeremy,False,34,"We're quite a gang obviously, us two. Brains and the funny one. The old stick up his arse, boring jumper one, and the sexy, pep up the party, acid in the punch bowl one."
622,622,6,Jeremy,False,17,"But we get on pretty well. I mean, we have our ups and downs like any couple."
623,623,6,Jeremy,False,23,"...and a boring bastard sometimes, but at the end of the day, we've lived together for shit long and it's been... all right."
624,624,6,Jeremy,True,12,That is sweet. That might be the nicest thing he's ever said.
625,625,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, Angus, don't be a big silly."
626,626,6,Jeremy,False,13,This has nothing to do with Mark or Hans. It's all my doing.
627,627,6,Jeremy,False,31,"Angus wanted stuff done to him. I wasn't into it. It's all pretty disgusting. I don't want to go into details, but it's complicated. We'll probably never fully understand, like Stonehenge."
628,628,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
629,629,6,Jeremy,False,2,See ya.
630,630,6,Jeremy,False,6,Are we gonna be all right?
631,631,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh God, I am so tired."
632,632,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Mark, will you pull me off?"
633,633,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Sure, whatever. I just thought it might be comforting."
634,634,6,Jeremy,False,12,"If I was gonna kill you, I'd have a great sign off."
635,635,6,Jeremy,False,14,"You always loved history, Mark. Well now, you can be part of it. Bang."
636,636,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, that's you all over."
637,637,6,Jeremy,True,7,"Aww, we do love each other really."
638,638,1,Mark,True,41,"I'll never forget he tried to steal my girlfriend. But I won't mention it tonight, can't ruin Super Hans' stag. I've reached acceptance. With the aid of a self-help CD I loathe, I've reached acceptance. Oh, my God, there he is."
639,639,1,Mark,True,19,"Relax, no recriminations on the stag. I haven't had a night out for months, no recriminations on the stag."
640,640,1,Mark,False,2,Hello Jeremy.
641,641,1,Mark,False,3,"Likewise, I'm sure."
642,642,1,Mark,False,3,I'm most content.
643,643,1,Mark,False,12,"I mean, obviously not that happy since Dobby moved to New York."
644,644,1,Mark,True,7,"Ugh, I did recriminations on the stag."
645,645,1,Mark,False,18,"Well, this is it, Super Hans' stag. Hard hats on, time to descend into the depths of depravity."
646,646,1,Mark,False,14,"Jez, do you think at some point soon that it's gonna start to degenerate?"
647,647,1,Mark,False,16,"Delicious, Hans. I'm just not sure how much more juice I can manage, to be honest."
648,648,1,Mark,False,6,When do you think it'll degenerate?
649,649,1,Mark,False,2,"Unless, um..."
650,650,1,Mark,False,6,"Exactly, just to wet the whistle."
651,651,1,Mark,False,4,"Ha, it did degenerate."
652,652,1,Mark,False,14,"All right, you're home now, let's get you on the futon. Sleep it off."
653,653,1,Mark,False,17,"You're living here with Super Hans and his fiancée, the three of you in their tiny flat?"
654,654,1,Mark,False,4,So where do you...?
655,655,1,Mark,False,4,This is your room?
656,656,1,Mark,True,9,This is the most pathetic sight known to man.
657,657,1,Mark,False,10,"Yeah, that's probably a good way to think of it."
658,658,1,Mark,False,6,"Ah, OK, that's a good system."
659,659,1,Mark,False,7,Clever. You've got a great set-up here.
660,660,1,Mark,True,3,"Hmm, toilet toast."
661,661,1,Mark,False,20,"Right, well, you probably want to turn in. Once Super Hans has finished his disgusting business. I'll see you around."
662,662,1,Mark,True,5,"Finally, let the apologathon commence."
663,663,1,Mark,False,6,"Jez, this is Jerry. Jerry, Jez."
664,664,1,Mark,False,6,Jerry's a colleague from the bank.
665,665,1,Mark,False,10,"I work at a bank now, Johnson got me in."
666,666,1,Mark,False,6,"Yep, and he's off the sauce."
667,667,1,Mark,False,19,"Yes, he certainly likes a lot of tomato sauce on his chips. Jerry moved in a few weeks back."
668,668,1,Mark,False,1,Boing.
669,669,1,Mark,False,6,Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
670,670,1,Mark,False,31,"They're all my mugs, Jez. Jerry's a William Morris fan, we both are. ""Have nothing in your room that you do not believe to be beautiful or know to be useful."""
671,671,1,Mark,False,26,"I don't think so. So, what was it you wanted to say? I've got work in the morning so I'd quite like to get to bed."
672,672,1,Mark,True,18,"Watch him grovel live, while I swirl a brandy and hold a bread stick like a big cigar."
673,673,1,Mark,False,2,That's it?
674,674,1,Mark,False,11,You don't perhaps wish to play the classic board game Sorry?
675,675,1,Mark,False,21,"Or we could hunt for YouTube clips of the Ronnie Corbett sitcom ""Sorry!"" while we ate some (bit much) sorrel soup."
676,676,1,Mark,False,16,"Right. You're not to blame for anything? Well, fine. Goodnight. I'll see you around, no doubt."
677,677,1,Mark,False,4,What are you doing?
678,678,1,Mark,False,10,"No, it's not cool, Jerry needs it, it's not yours."
679,679,1,Mark,False,10,"Jeremy, this isn't normal. It is, it's all totally normal!"
680,680,1,Mark,True,11,"There he goes, duvet cape man off to his toilet kitchen."
681,681,1,Mark,True,44,"Finally working at a bank, and banks have turned into phone shops. But it is still a bank. I'm the Wolf of Wall Street. Look out, Boots, I'm going to buy a hundred meal deals and eat them off a prossie in the nude."
682,682,1,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, great, actually, old pal."
683,683,1,Mark,False,2,"Uh, no?"
684,684,1,Mark,False,2,Oh. Right.
685,685,1,Mark,True,9,Got to get my dick out of the dog.
686,686,1,Mark,False,9,"Ha, yeah, he certainly needs a little more sauce."
687,687,1,Mark,True,17,"Ugh, just repeating the joke. I need to elaborate on the conceit, but too worried about redundancy."
688,688,1,Mark,True,23,"Jerry's sales record shits on mine. I need to sell a loan. Fuck, where's a good old-fashioned gullible idiot when you need one?"
689,689,1,Mark,False,18,"Uh-huh. The good thing is that to get, say, three thousand pounds, you'd pay just twenty-one percent APR."
690,690,1,Mark,False,17,"It's pretty good, yeah. And you'd only need to repay two percent of the capital a month."
691,691,1,Mark,True,12,If you want the loan to last a hundred and eighty-four years.
692,692,1,Mark,False,4,It's not quite free.
693,693,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
694,694,1,Mark,False,23,"Yes, you've winkled me out. It is basically free. And the interesting thing about you is that you'd actually qualify as an F6."
695,695,1,Mark,False,9,It's a credit rating especially for people like you.
696,696,1,Mark,True,10,The terminally ill and criminals who might flee to Thailand.
697,697,1,Mark,False,25,"Yes, you have, Jez. You have. And to qualify for this loan, all you need is a reference from a landlord or a former landlord."
698,698,1,Mark,True,6,Would you like to play capitalism?
699,699,1,Mark,True,9,"Homeless Jeremy. No, harden the heart, I'm moving on."
700,700,1,Mark,False,29,"Look, Jez, you wouldn't want to live with me and Jerry. We're stick-in-the-muds who like nothing better than watching Civilisation with Kenneth Clark whilst eating artichokes and sea bream."
701,701,1,Mark,True,15,There goes the first beat of the butterfly wing that starts the next financial meltdown.
702,702,1,Mark,False,13,"Six forty-five. There's a lot of evening, isn't there? Without the goggle box."
703,703,1,Mark,False,3,"Um, yeah, brilliant."
704,704,1,Mark,True,38,"Ugh, more William Morris. Wallpaper and workers' rights. God, this is like the Dark Ages. Centuries and centuries with nothing to look forward to except the slim possibility a Viking might break down the door and rape me."
705,705,1,Mark,True,41,"Crush, crush the candy. So relentless, so satisfying yet unsatisfying. Like Cleopatra, Candy Crush makes hungry where most she satisfies. Crushing candy, quoting Shakespeare, hiding in a toilet of my own home. This is the confused high point of Western civilisation."
706,706,1,Mark,False,10,"Oh, fine, thanks, Jerry. Shouldn't be too much longer now."
707,707,1,Mark,True,10,"Argh! Thought I'd killed twenty minutes of Morris, but no!"
708,708,1,Mark,False,1,Uh-
709,709,1,Mark,True,5,could just shut the door?
710,710,1,Mark,False,8,Maybe you'd better come in for a minute.
711,711,1,Mark,True,23,"Has he read the loan small print? Yeah right, he doesn't read the large print. But he might protect me temporarily from Morris."
712,712,1,Mark,False,9,"Quite like to get back to my reading, so..."
713,713,1,Mark,True,8,"Fucking Facebook! Zuckerberg's fucked me again, that arsehole."
714,714,1,Mark,False,9,I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
715,715,1,Mark,False,4,Perhaps I was hacked.
716,716,1,Mark,False,2,It could.
717,717,1,Mark,False,8,"Well, I can't think of any other explanation."
718,718,1,Mark,True,6,"It wasn't Antwerp, it was Freiburg."
719,719,1,Mark,True,14,"I do want Octopussy and a Twirl, but I'm not giving him the satisfaction."
720,720,1,Mark,False,2,Shall we?
721,721,1,Mark,False,2,I'm interested.
722,722,1,Mark,False,5,You're reading Mr. Nice again?
723,723,1,Mark,True,7,"Oh God, he's going for the thermostat."
724,724,1,Mark,True,8,The Aldi Poirot with his CBBC magnifying glass.
725,725,1,Mark,False,9,"Right, who wants a nice cup of the Kenco?"
726,726,1,Mark,False,5,"Try a bit harder, Jeremy."
727,727,1,Mark,False,5,He did not hit you.
728,728,1,Mark,False,1,No.
729,729,1,Mark,False,2,No reason.
730,730,1,Mark,False,1,No.
731,731,1,Mark,False,7,Of course it's the fucking Dobby thing.
732,732,1,Mark,False,21,You tried to profess your love to my girlfriend who I was trying to propose to. You fucked up my life!
733,733,1,Mark,False,5,I want you to apologise!
734,734,1,Mark,False,2,No dice.
735,735,1,Mark,False,4,"Say it properly, Jeremy!"
736,736,1,Mark,False,1,Nope.
737,737,1,Mark,False,1,And?
738,738,1,Mark,True,1,Finally!
739,739,1,Mark,True,9,"Oh, Jesus, he's going to say he loves me."
740,740,1,Mark,False,2,Apology accepted.
741,741,1,Mark,False,17,"Maybe I do sometimes wonder about Jerry, but I've made my bed, so I've just got to-"
742,742,1,Mark,True,3,What's he doing?
743,743,1,Mark,False,2,The Sopranos?
744,744,1,Mark,False,3,Oh. John Ruskin.
745,745,1,Mark,False,14,"The thing is, Jerry, I'm not sure I could live with a drug head."
746,746,1,Mark,False,23,Maybe I'm not quite as interested in William Morris as I thought I was when you first started to go on about him.
747,747,1,Mark,False,6,"I can't just say things, Jerry."
748,748,1,Mark,False,14,"Well, we can't go back now. The atmosphere is soured. We have no choice."
749,749,1,Mark,False,3,"Well, I can't."
750,750,1,Mark,False,4,Kill him? With polonium?
751,751,1,Mark,False,1,Um...
752,752,1,Mark,False,10,"Here's your tea, Jerry. God, you must get better soon."
753,753,1,Mark,False,13,"No, he's an irritatingly sound sleeper. Earplugs and eye mask, the full blot."
754,754,1,Mark,False,6,"No, no, we couldn't. Could we?"
755,755,1,Mark,False,4,This doesn't feel good.
756,756,1,Mark,False,1,Hans?
757,757,1,Mark,False,5,"OK, everything's out. What now?"
758,758,1,Mark,False,1,Um...
759,759,1,Mark,False,5,"What is this, farty Guantanamo?"
760,760,1,Mark,False,17,"No, I- I think we have to wake him up, just tell him to leave, like men."
761,761,1,Mark,False,1,What?
762,762,1,Mark,True,36,"I'm definitely going to agree to this. I just need to put up an acceptable level of objection so I can be all reproachful if it proves to be a disaster, which it almost certainly will."
763,763,1,Mark,False,12,"No! No way, no. Well, OK, but on your heads be it."
764,764,1,Mark,False,3,Put him out.
765,765,1,Mark,False,3,"I'm sorry, Jerry."
766,766,1,Mark,False,2,He doesn't-
767,767,1,Mark,False,3,"you don't, Jerry."
768,768,1,Mark,False,6,"I'm not part of this, Jerry."
769,769,1,Mark,False,18,I want to read my Napoleon correspondence and watch Storage Hunters. Does that make me a bad person?
770,770,1,Mark,False,3,Don't kick him.
771,771,1,Mark,False,9,"Jerry, stay still. This will all be over soon."
772,772,1,Mark,False,14,"All good here, it's just a prank. It's high jinks. We're the Croydon Bullingdon."
773,773,1,Mark,False,2,"Shush, Jerry."
774,774,1,Mark,False,3,In he goes.
775,775,1,Mark,False,7,"Bye, Jerry. See you at work tomorrow."
776,776,2,Mark,True,55,"There she is, hovering ominously, Dobby's yellow head. I'm not about to masturbate looking at the head. That's what they want me to do. Hm, same noodle bar she went to yesterday, and Tuesday. What's going on at the noodle bar? Three-star reviews. It's possible she just likes the food. But hard to completely believe."
777,777,2,Mark,False,6,"No, wear a jumper, walk about."
778,778,2,Mark,False,12,"Uh-huh. Seems Dobby never deleted me off her ""Find My Friends"" app."
779,779,2,Mark,False,76,"I'm trying to build up a picture of her mental state. For example, there's this organic bakery she's been to this afternoon and twice more this week. I checked their Twitter and their carrot cake just ran out. The other day, she was in and the same thing happened. It could be a coincidence. I'm not saying she's eating a whole carrot cake every time she goes in there, but you've got to admit, it's interesting."
780,780,2,Mark,False,13,She stopped answering my calls after I went a bit overboard that time.
781,781,2,Mark,False,1,Mm.
782,782,2,Mark,True,9,So unfair. The three hundred and twenty-seven text month.
783,783,2,Mark,False,19,"Put it back, Jeremy. That thing eats electricity. It's only seven hours till the central heating comes back on."
784,784,2,Mark,True,22,"It's going in the vault. The new regime. Heater in the cupboard, tracker tag on the nice towel, mousetrap in the Frosties."
785,785,2,Mark,False,2,No problem.
786,786,2,Mark,True,21,"Mate? He wants my liver for a transplant? Well, he can't have it. And I'm saving my kidneys for little Ian."
787,787,2,Mark,False,10,"Oh, that's, that's very nice of you to say, Hans."
788,788,2,Mark,False,6,Best man? But what about Jez?
789,789,2,Mark,False,2,Thank you?
790,790,2,Mark,True,27,"There is nothing that could persuade me to strap myself to the huge, flaming Super Hans wedding zeppelin with a gang of drugged-up goons. Oh, hang on."
791,791,2,Mark,False,3,Is Dobby invited?
792,792,2,Mark,False,14,"I mean, I- I'd love to come. But maybe without being your best man."
793,793,2,Mark,True,5,"Oh, strap on the cummerbund."
794,794,2,Mark,False,1,Hello.
795,795,2,Mark,False,14,Just taking a temperature reading. I thought perhaps you'd bought your own fan heater.
796,796,2,Mark,False,15,"I need to get off for Fakenham, to be there the night before, for everything."
797,797,2,Mark,False,10,"While I'm gone, no turning the central heating to constant."
798,798,2,Mark,False,3,"I'm sorry, Jez."
799,799,2,Mark,False,60,"I only said yes because of Dobby. To win her back. I need to get back to the good times. Hours on the sofa, DVDs and takeaway lamb pasanda. I'm going to be the Mark Dobby always wanted, who goes to those spoken-word poetry events where most of the poems are by women about the awesome power of the C-U-N-T."
800,800,2,Mark,False,9,There's enough unpleasantness in the world. See you tomorrow.
801,801,2,Mark,True,133,"I have so many funny stories about Hans, where do I start? The time he tried to cut my legs off when he was tripping because he thought I was a demon? Or the time he just went straight for me with a chicken skewer for no apparent reason? Shit, Dobby's off-grid. She could be anywhere. So selfish. Quick ""Neighbourhood Watch"" over my own personal neighbourhood, then maybe a disappointing Skype chat with my son. There's nothing unethical about secretly filming my own flat. If he's got nothing to hide, he's got nothing to fear. A vest? That heat-thieving bastard. I should put a mousetrap in there, that'd be fun. It's time for the show trial. I'm going to make him confess his thermostat crimes. The heating Stasi are coming for you, Jeremy."
802,802,2,Mark,False,10,"Oh, good, Jeremy, you? You're looking quite toasty over there."
803,803,2,Mark,False,10,"Oh, really? Not according to the Met Office, it's not."
804,804,2,Mark,False,7,There is no microclimate around Apollo House.
805,805,2,Mark,False,4,You don't look chilly.
806,806,2,Mark,False,15,Bullshit. It's an hour outside the agreed heating window and the flat looks incredibly warm.
807,807,2,Mark,False,2,Who's that?
808,808,2,Mark,False,28,"Don't joke. Now, turn the heating off, put a jumper on and text me a picture of you wearing it in front of the thermostat with today's paper."
809,809,2,Mark,False,5,"Coming, Hans. Oh, God, Dobby."
810,810,2,Mark,False,10,"Wow, did you just arrive? Did- did your phone die?"
811,811,2,Mark,False,4,Great to see you.
812,812,2,Mark,False,3,Good option. Blaaaargh!
813,813,2,Mark,True,16,"OK, she's still adorable. Time to go to DEFCON 1. Roll out the new Mark manifesto."
814,814,2,Mark,False,11,"Dobby, come in. There was actually something I wanted to say."
815,815,2,Mark,True,11,"No pressure, but go out with me or I'll hang myself."
816,816,2,Mark,True,18,Who the fuck are you? And what have you got against two hundred and forty lovely British volts?
817,817,2,Mark,False,1,Hi.
818,818,2,Mark,False,5,And what does Gregory do?
819,819,2,Mark,False,4,And the carrot cakes?
820,820,2,Mark,True,3,I knew it.
821,821,2,Mark,False,6,What's Jeremy doing in my bedroom?
822,822,2,Mark,False,12,"Webcams. If Jeremy has nothing to hide, he has nothing to fear."
823,823,2,Mark,False,27,"Some guy. He's taken some guy into my room. Oh, God. Is he going to sell all my stuff, or, or download something horrible onto my computer?"
824,824,2,Mark,False,1,OK.
825,825,2,Mark,False,35,"Don't know, he's always been pretty slutty and a bit... but not actually the full... God, maybe he does this every time I leave the house. Oh, God, what are they going to do next?"
826,826,2,Mark,False,14,"Well, why can't they do it in his bed? We should turn this off."
827,827,2,Mark,False,6,That reading light's going to go.
828,828,2,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, that gives it a certain suspense. I really feel I shouldn't be watching this."
829,829,2,Mark,False,7,Are they-? Is my room all right?
830,830,2,Mark,False,15,It's accidental. I just wanted to make sure he hadn't turned up the central heating.
831,831,2,Mark,True,24,I will not watch this. I'm going to go and stare into the mirror and wait out the fucking like it's an air raid.
832,832,2,Mark,False,6,Ugh. Anything else for the speech?
833,833,2,Mark,True,13,"Heh-heh, everyone trusts the pathetic worm. It's good to be a pathetic worm."
834,834,2,Mark,False,36,"Uh-huh. That's- that's a good story. Um, anything I could use that might be a bit more romantic? Also, and I know this might sound like a bit of a starter question, but... what's your name?"
835,835,2,Mark,False,21,"I understand, and I'm sorry for being rude. No, you've explained the economics of running a rural taxi firm very clearly."
836,836,2,Mark,False,5,Three hours for a cab.
837,837,2,Mark,False,6,"Oh, no, Hans, no, not that."
838,838,2,Mark,False,14,"Er, so, yeah, Dobs, I just wanted to say, about the million-text month, sorry."
839,839,2,Mark,False,10,"Yeah, was sort of like a living death, wasn't it?"
840,840,2,Mark,True,3,It was lovely.
841,841,2,Mark,False,20,"Yeah, 'cos I've actually been thinking of maybe training it to Budapest and getting into mime and, fucking, street theatre."
842,842,2,Mark,False,28,"Oh, God, no. Why would anyone be driving around at this time? It doesn't make any sense. Dobby, we're not seriously going to get into a stranger's car?"
843,843,2,Mark,False,5,"Maniacs, people smugglers, organ harvesters."
844,844,2,Mark,True,11,"Mmm, everyone's drinking the Kool-Aid. I don't want any delicious Kool-Aid."
845,845,2,Mark,True,8,"God, they're doggers, I'm going to get dogged."
846,846,2,Mark,False,12,"Oh, we've just been out for a few tomato juices, heading home."
847,847,2,Mark,True,11,"Oh, my God. I knew someone was going to get murdered."
848,848,2,Mark,False,1,Hans!
849,849,2,Mark,False,4,Do not murder him.
850,850,2,Mark,False,2,"Er, nothing."
851,851,2,Mark,False,8,"No, no, I said not to murder you."
852,852,2,Mark,False,6,"No, no murdering, it's a misunderstanding."
853,853,2,Mark,False,53,"Touché! We, we relent, seriously, no, no harm meant. I- I momentarily thought that there was an outside chance that my pal might be going to try to murder you and I was just checking that he wasn't, so we're all good. So, what's, er, what's your position on the whole Euro situation?"
854,854,2,Mark,False,2,I know.
855,855,2,Mark,False,23,"I think it's good how you said it. I mean, I would have said it eventually. Maybe a bit closer to our destination."
856,856,2,Mark,False,2,No shoes?
857,857,2,Mark,False,8,"There are no wolves in East Anglia, Hans."
858,858,2,Mark,False,4,"Oh, God, five miles?"
859,859,2,Mark,True,34,"The prospect of spending the night huddled in a haystack with Dobby should be thrilling, but all I can think about is my hotel bed and my pillow chocolate. I want my pillow chocolate."
860,860,2,Mark,True,44,"Oh, no pillow chocolate. I don't expect them to actually run me a bath. I simply want to eat some chocolate off my pillow like a normal human being. Could it be Dobby? Maybe Gregory's minor headache was an aneurysm. Heh-heh, naughty but nice."
861,861,2,Mark,False,1,Oh.
862,862,2,Mark,False,12,"I thought you'd be here tomorrow. I am actually quite tired, so..."
863,863,2,Mark,True,3,The inevitable Jez.
864,864,2,Mark,False,17,"Disaster, she's got a boyfriend. She seems a lot happier, comfier in her own skin. She's blossomed."
865,865,2,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh.
866,866,2,Mark,True,9,"I know nothing, don't pre-empt. Blank face, blank face."
867,867,2,Mark,True,2,Total surprise.
868,868,2,Mark,False,6,"I'm, I'm sorry, in your bedroom?"
869,869,2,Mark,False,8,"Just to clarify, you were in your bedroom?"
870,870,2,Mark,False,14,"Not the kitchen, or the living room, or any other room in the flat?"
871,871,2,Mark,False,6,"No, fine, go on, I-I-I'm sorry."
872,872,2,Mark,False,24,"Uh-huh, I get it, mate. And what, out- out of interest, was the temperature like in the room when, when you were doing it?"
873,873,2,Mark,False,13,"Look, I'm sorry, Jez, but I've, I've got a webcam in my bedroom."
874,874,2,Mark,False,9,I saw the whole thing and so did Dobby.
875,875,2,Mark,False,11,You chose to go into my bedroom. You- you filmed yourself.
876,876,2,Mark,False,5,Gregory sure loves his phone.
877,877,2,Mark,True,22,"Looking at his phone and she loves it. I could look at my phone, we all want to look at our phones."
878,878,2,Mark,True,5,Simon? Super Simon? Simon Hans?
879,879,2,Mark,False,6,"Hear, hear, the bride and groom!"
880,880,2,Mark,True,128,"Mention the seven years working in Richer Sounds in Kew, miss out the Thai jail, onto the bands, drop the first marriage, hit Jeremy and their long friendship, minus all the bad blood and occasional sucking each other off, blah, blah, blah, wrap up with a toast to the bride and groom, Hans, or possibly Simon, and his wife, whose Christian name I've unfortunately forgotten. Shit, I don't really know either of their names. There's Dobby. She doesn't like pasanda and quality TV drama. She likes hitchhiking and terrifying actual drama. We don't fit. Oh, my God, I'm letting go. I've crossed the bridge into adulthood. I'm moving on. I'm going to delete her off my GPS. Weird, it looks like she's right behind me. Fuck, what the-"
881,881,2,Mark,False,9,"Gregory, believe me, I don't. I'm not, I've stopped."
882,882,2,Mark,False,13,Literally just now. I was just about to delete her off my phone.
883,883,2,Mark,False,45,"I promise you, I don't like her any more. She always saying exactly what she's thinking, with no regards for the consequences and she's got weird hair, and she smokes. Ah, please don't punch me. I wish you both well. I wish you both well!"
884,884,3,Mark,True,72,"Hmm, once upon a time, I might've woken to the sound of a song thrush. Now, it's a couple of guys pounding the living daylights out of each other. I mean, it's fine. It's just, when Jeremy had sex with women, I hated the noise, but at least there was something in it for me. Now it's like there are two Jeremys in there humping each other. That would be his dream."
885,885,3,Mark,False,14,"So, just to be clear for my records, you're sleeping with Joe regularly now?"
886,886,3,Mark,False,13,"I can handle it. I'm fine with it, just what, you've gone gay?"
887,887,3,Mark,False,34,"Sure, but let's say, you had a Wikipedia page, which obviously you don't, regardless of how many times you try and put one up. Would it say that Jeremy Usbourne was gay or straight?"
888,888,3,Mark,False,5,"Yes, yes I believe that."
889,889,3,Mark,False,3,You and Pej?
890,890,3,Mark,False,21,"I have a long and varied list of regrets, Jeremy, but not being pulled off by Pej isn't one of them."
891,891,3,Mark,False,6,"I'm eating a Fruit Corner, Jeremy."
892,892,3,Mark,False,1,One.
893,893,3,Mark,False,7,I very much regret starting this conversation.
894,894,3,Mark,True,14,The gay couple. I live with a gay couple. It's political correctness gone normal.
895,895,3,Mark,False,13,"Oh, uh, no. I mean, you're older and intelligent and full of cum."
896,896,3,Mark,False,3,Oh I'm sure...
897,897,3,Mark,True,5,How did I get here?
898,898,3,Mark,False,6,I'm sure you're full of cum.
899,899,3,Mark,True,81,"The one that got away. Lovely April, but you can't get away from Google, April. Corrigan and Google, the maverick detectives, who just won't give up. Yep, she's just as beautiful as she was when I failed to sleep with her in Darty, and she knows a fuckload about the Ottoman Empire. If she voices the audio book, then it's look out St Basil, because I am gonna buy a box of wet wipes and have me a wanky Byzantine party."
900,900,3,Mark,True,17,"""We studied ancient history at Dartmouth but that's all ancient history. Ha ha ha ha ha."" No."
901,901,3,Mark,False,30,"Hi, I love the Ottoman Empire, I think I feel an affinity because some ingeniously savage children at my secondary school called me the ""sick man of Europe."" Sorry, TMI?"
902,902,3,Mark,True,6,Two peas in a fucking pod.
903,903,3,Mark,False,3,"Mark, Mark Corrigan."
904,904,3,Mark,True,32,"Does she recognise me? I should say something. Could come clean. ""You sold me some brogues and I followed you two hundred miles and faked being a mature student to see you."""
905,905,3,Mark,False,2,My pleasure.
906,906,3,Mark,True,16,"This is my chance, and I'm doing nothing. I am now, this instant, missing my chance."
907,907,3,Mark,False,28,"Sorry to flout the queuing system like some syphilitic sultan, but I just wanted to say that we did actually meet once before, years ago at Dartmouth Uni."
908,908,3,Mark,False,38,"I transferred from Coventry then I transferred back again. It was complicated. I think Bez won Big Brother around then. Kilroy started Veritas, crazy times. I'm rambling but how would you like to, have a glass of wine?"
909,909,3,Mark,False,11,"So, this is your secret identity? Sort of like Indiana Jones."
910,910,3,Mark,True,14,"An Indiana Jones reference, mixed with a Ghostbusters reference. I love you, April Danecroft."
911,911,3,Mark,False,8,I couldn't help noticing that your book's co-written.
912,912,3,Mark,True,1,Shit!
913,913,3,Mark,True,6,"Of course, of course she's married."
914,914,3,Mark,False,11,You write together? That sounds like a dream sort of setup.
915,915,3,Mark,True,1,Interesting.
916,916,3,Mark,True,12,"Hello, resentment, my old friend. I've come to stoke you up again."
917,917,3,Mark,False,12,"No, I mean, if I can just search the old memory banks."
918,918,3,Mark,True,6,For the moment I replay nightly.
919,919,3,Mark,False,14,"We might've had one cuddle once, but that was about it, as I recall."
920,920,3,Mark,True,12,"She's leaving again. Come on, Mark! Pull your dick from the stone."
921,921,3,Mark,False,18,"As a matter of fact, I'm having a dinner party tomorrow night. Ridiculously short notice, I know but-"
922,922,3,Mark,False,17,"Well, why don't you come on your own? It's not like you're chained together, or are you?"
923,923,3,Mark,False,15,"Tomorrow, it's a date. I mean, that is the date on which it shall happen."
924,924,3,Mark,True,26,"Yes! Olympus has fallen. Now all I have to do is cook a meal so delicious she will make love to me. Such as, cheesy pasta."
925,925,3,Mark,False,9,Thought you were going to the cinema with Joe.
926,926,3,Mark,False,3,I'm making hummus.
927,927,3,Mark,False,4,"It's only hummus, Jeremy."
928,928,3,Mark,False,11,"As a matter of fact, I have made my own pasta."
929,929,3,Mark,False,9,"April from Darty is coming over, as it happens."
930,930,3,Mark,False,39,"It isn't a lair, it's my flat, and my sole subterfuge is that she thinks she's coming to a dinner party, but I've got a feeling that the other guests may cancel at the last minute. Naughty unreliable guests."
931,931,3,Mark,False,43,"Jez, I think she might actually be my perfect woman. She's a serious academic historian who got my joke about Indiana Jones. She just texted saying, ""Professor Jones has her whip ready."" I think its probably the sexiest text anyone has ever received."
932,932,3,Mark,False,5,Brilliant. But far too mad.
933,933,3,Mark,False,21,"I was thinking, how can I turn up the heat? I could blink at her as she came through the door."
934,934,3,Mark,False,23,"It would be a bit of a hoot, wouldn't it? But its the sort of thing you'd think about but never actually do."
935,935,3,Mark,False,2,"No, Jez!"
936,936,3,Mark,False,1,God!
937,937,3,Mark,False,27,"Oh, this is crazy! You're mental! How does it look? Oh my God, why would she be here so early? I haven't even finished pureeing the chickpeas!"
938,938,3,Mark,False,1,Great!
939,939,3,Mark,False,31,"There we go. Four and a half hours of tears and sweat and pain and it will, if I'm lucky, taste almost as nice as a slice of freshly buttered toast."
940,940,3,Mark,False,12,"April. Doctor Jones, I presume? Just whipping up a feast. Ha ha."
941,941,3,Mark,True,2,No way!
942,942,3,Mark,False,6,"No problemo, amigo. Hasta la vista."
943,943,3,Mark,True,8,Spanish? Has the stress turned me entirely Spanish?
944,944,3,Mark,False,21,"Of course, they won't mind. They're very relaxed, the other guests. One more person at the dinner party, no big deal."
945,945,3,Mark,False,1,Adios.
946,946,3,Mark,True,7,"Ugh, utterly fucked up and unaccountably Spanish."
947,947,3,Mark,False,19,"Hi there, I know you've probably got plans tonight but I insist you all stay for a delicious feast."
948,948,3,Mark,False,11,"Well, that's as it may be but I'm afraid I insist."
949,949,3,Mark,False,11,"Joe, Megan, it is going to be amazing. You must stay."
950,950,3,Mark,False,1,Wonderful.
951,951,3,Mark,False,11,"I'm sorry, but I need backup. Angus is coming. April's husband."
952,952,3,Mark,False,20,"Yes, well, she's got a husband and in thirty minutes, he'll want some dinner. I need to bulk out. Lettuce!"
953,953,3,Mark,False,16,"They'll bring wine, but we need booze. Where's the rum? Get the rum, make a cocktail."
954,954,3,Mark,False,32,Any fucking thing. Rum and water. Rum and milk. Chop some parsley into it. They're all basically horrible. It's action stations. Fuck! How quickly can you get to Mr. Patel's and back?
955,955,3,Mark,False,5,I can't serve baked beans.
956,956,3,Mark,False,5,Beans are not pasta sauce.
957,957,3,Mark,False,8,Ketchup is tomatoey. That's not a pasta sauce.
958,958,3,Mark,False,5,I'm picking the beans out.
959,959,3,Mark,False,31,"Mashed! I can mash them. Right, we're getting somewhere. Cooking's all about confidence. I'm just gonna mix it all together. I need to go Nigella. I'm gonna be the Hairy Biker."
960,960,3,Mark,False,6,How about some lovely filling lettuce?
961,961,3,Mark,False,2,I'm improvising.
962,962,3,Mark,False,4,How old are these?
963,963,3,Mark,False,3,Are they? Yeah?
964,964,3,Mark,False,4,Maybe it is Moroccan.
965,965,3,Mark,False,13,"Right, OK. I like it that way. They can't prove otherwise, fuck them."
966,966,3,Mark,False,3,Do you think?
967,967,3,Mark,False,8,"Oh my God, I forgot. Oh my God!"
968,968,3,Mark,False,8,Is it coming off? Is it coming off?
969,969,3,Mark,False,6,"Jeremy, did you use permanent marker?"
970,970,3,Mark,False,7,I'm gonna have to bleach my eyes.
971,971,3,Mark,False,13,I'm gonna have to keep my eyes open all night. Is that possible?
972,972,3,Mark,True,15,I can do this. I can do this all night. Oh I can't do this.
973,973,3,Mark,True,4,"Don't blink, don't blink."
974,974,3,Mark,False,2,"Hi, April."
975,975,3,Mark,True,13,Just got to keep my eyes firmly open. That's the most important thing.
976,976,3,Mark,False,2,"Oh, lovely."
977,977,3,Mark,True,10,That'll be one bottle of wine between six then. Perfect.
978,978,3,Mark,False,2,"Yes, briefly."
979,979,3,Mark,True,16,"Almost unbearable urge to blink. Ah, lovely, lovely blink. Enjoy it, last one of the night."
980,980,3,Mark,False,4,Shall we go through?
981,981,3,Mark,False,15,"Help yourself to hummus, it's freshly made, and if I say so myself, quite delicious."
982,982,3,Mark,True,6,Unlike the rest of the meal.
983,983,3,Mark,False,1,Cocktail?
984,984,3,Mark,True,10,"Mmm, rum, water, lettuce, vinegar and the secret ingredient, salt."
985,985,3,Mark,False,8,April said you were off to a conference.
986,986,3,Mark,True,7,"Ooh, look who's won the lettuce lottery."
987,987,3,Mark,False,8,"It's Moroccan. I love it, it's quite subtle."
988,988,3,Mark,True,8,Blink impulse off the scale and drink disgusting.
989,989,3,Mark,False,14,Good idea. I'll just go and see where the other guests have got to.
990,990,3,Mark,False,9,"OK, can you haul in the mannequins, the normalizers?"
991,991,3,Mark,False,14,"Also, Megan, would you happen to have a small makeup bag about your person?"
992,992,3,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
993,993,3,Mark,False,15,"Do I claim fancy dress or go full English, button down, hope they don't mention?"
994,994,3,Mark,False,2,Right. God.
995,995,3,Mark,False,4,You're humping them both?
996,996,3,Mark,False,12,"Oh, that must be really hard. I'm so sorry for you, Jez."
997,997,3,Mark,False,13,"Well, you can't fuck them both, I'm afraid, that's not how civilisation works."
998,998,3,Mark,False,8,Did Maggie mention that she's actually an artist?
999,999,3,Mark,False,9,"Of course. Maggie's just a nickname, that she hates."
1000,1000,3,Mark,False,18,"Uh, yes. That's something I'm doing. I understood it was the fashion but I may have been misinformed."
1001,1001,3,Mark,True,4,"Serve up, move on."
1002,1002,3,Mark,True,11,"He's very decent, very wholesome. How can I steal his wife?"
1003,1003,3,Mark,False,3,Do dig in.
1004,1004,3,Mark,False,6,"It's Moroccan, like my eye shadow."
1005,1005,3,Mark,False,26,I'd hate to call you a racist at my dinner party but I think it's a little more sophisticated than that. It's from the Atlas Mountains.
1006,1006,3,Mark,False,1,What?
1007,1007,3,Mark,False,3,"No, I don't."
1008,1008,3,Mark,False,8,I have no idea what he's talking about.
1009,1009,3,Mark,True,5,There goes a valuable glassful.
1010,1010,3,Mark,True,9,"Oh, brilliant. Freak show sideshow at the shit show."
1011,1011,3,Mark,True,1,Hello.
1012,1012,3,Mark,True,5,Stop actually rubbing my hands.
1013,1013,3,Mark,False,1,Corfu?
1014,1014,3,Mark,False,10,I'm sure all's well now. I don't want to pry.
1015,1015,3,Mark,True,5,"Wheedle, wheedle, pry and needle."
1016,1016,3,Mark,False,18,"That can happen with wounds, it can be good to give them a good inspection now and again."
1017,1017,3,Mark,False,4,"Weak? How exactly, Angus?"
1018,1018,3,Mark,True,25,"This is amazing! So uncomfortable. This could be my night of greatest triumph, if we weren't all about to die from eating these poisonous eggs."
1019,1019,3,Mark,False,9,"For the cheese course, I have a soft cheese."
1020,1020,3,Mark,True,7,Dairylea moulded together with my bare hands.
1021,1021,3,Mark,False,5,Plus a tasty young Stilton.
1022,1022,3,Mark,True,12,Out of bread and crackers. Just need to state it with conviction.
1023,1023,3,Mark,False,6,It's time for cheese and lettuce.
1024,1024,3,Mark,True,6,Most natural combination in the world.
1025,1025,3,Mark,False,1,Threeism?
1026,1026,3,Mark,True,14,"Oh, Angus, you just can't seem to say the right thing. You lovely arsehole."
1027,1027,3,Mark,True,6,Just very sensitively shut her in.
1028,1028,3,Mark,False,6,"Of course, of course you do."
1029,1029,3,Mark,True,12,"Maybe I will, April. Although you might've picked a slightly corrupt postman."
1030,1030,3,Mark,False,25,"Look, don't shoot the messenger, but April said, she doesn't want to speak to you. She loves you, but she's not sure she likes you."
1031,1031,3,Mark,True,12,"Naughty postman. Drink down my lies, Angus. They taste good, don't they?"
1032,1032,3,Mark,False,18,"Yes, it's Ribena. I'm an alcoholic. I'm a complicated guy, with a complicated past. Like you and April."
1033,1033,3,Mark,False,11,Angus loves you but he doesn't know if he respects you.
1034,1034,3,Mark,False,11,"I was just explaining. I think I got it right, that-"
1035,1035,3,Mark,False,4,"Uh huh, that's wise."
1036,1036,3,Mark,True,5,"That's right, off you fuck."
1037,1037,3,Mark,False,17,"April, if you like, there's a B&B nearby, or I can take the sofa and you can-"
1038,1038,3,Mark,True,21,"Great, she's gone, and I'm left with the Jesus lunk who, because of manners, I can't simply push out the window."
1039,1039,3,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, the fighting phase seems to be ending, actually."
1040,1040,3,Mark,False,2,Right. Yes.
1041,1041,3,Mark,True,36,"Yep, let's sit here, me in my makeup and drink vinegar and lettuce and rum, and eat moulded Dairylea and scribbled cheddar, and talk it all through forever, while those two gently hump in the corner."
1042,1042,4,Mark,True,12,"Right, I want to beat Angus but fuck April. Freudian mixed doubles."
1043,1043,4,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy, can you hold your racket up?"
1044,1044,4,Mark,False,4,"Face forward, please, Jeremy."
1045,1045,4,Mark,False,7,You can't go. This is match point.
1046,1046,4,Mark,False,11,"Can we just finish the game and do this afterwards, please?"
1047,1047,4,Mark,False,2,"Unlucky, Angus."
1048,1048,4,Mark,True,5,"Welcome to hell, old man!"
1049,1049,4,Mark,False,41,"It's Angus. They've made up and now he's everywhere. I invite her to the library, he offers to give us a lift. Tennis... he makes it doubles. I mean, just look at him, hogging his wife. The big, brainy, wife-hogging shit."
1050,1050,4,Mark,True,10,"Now, Mark. Steal his wife while he fetches the Vectra."
1051,1051,4,Mark,False,27,"So, April, there's a- there's a talk on at the British Academy on Friday, and Andrew Roberts is doing a jam on World War I trench letters."
1052,1052,4,Mark,True,5,Love amongst the mustard gas.
1053,1053,4,Mark,False,7,"There's literally only two tickets left, sadly."
1054,1054,4,Mark,True,11,Cause I bought the last eight and burned the other six.
1055,1055,4,Mark,False,6,"So, I was wondering if you'd-"
1056,1056,4,Mark,False,1,Oh?
1057,1057,4,Mark,True,6,"Oh, April and your charming neuroses!"
1058,1058,4,Mark,False,30,I've been looking for a half-decent mole-mapping place for ages. By no means am I excessively moley. It's not like I'm riddled. I'd just like a full body Ordnance Survey.
1059,1059,4,Mark,False,8,"No, I am. I'm bang up for that."
1060,1060,4,Mark,False,3,It's a date!
1061,1061,4,Mark,True,7,"They all count, April. They all count."
1062,1062,4,Mark,False,10,I got the slot immediately after April! We're going mole-mapping!
1063,1063,4,Mark,True,8,"It's a date, and no-one can prove otherwise."
1064,1064,4,Mark,False,6,Absolutely you're a shit. Milk's gone.
1065,1065,4,Mark,False,12,"Oh, you're a shit, Jeremy. You are the shit on my shoe."
1066,1066,4,Mark,False,18,"A giant, walking, talking anthropomorphised shit on stilts. A shit for all seasons. The shit man of Europe."
1067,1067,4,Mark,False,12,"Well, I've enjoyed this, Jeremy. It's pepped me up, it really has."
1068,1068,4,Mark,False,10,"Yes, well, I may have mentioned something about this, Jeremy."
1069,1069,4,Mark,False,6,"Sorry, you jazz into the flannel?"
1070,1070,4,Mark,False,3,"Which flannel, Jeremy?"
1071,1071,4,Mark,False,19,"Right! Which flannel have you jazzed on? Answer the fucking question! Jesus Christ, Jeremy! That is beyond the pale!"
1072,1072,4,Mark,False,11,"How very reassuring. Now, excuse me while I boil-wash my face!"
1073,1073,4,Mark,False,12,"So, what was your final tally? What's the scores on the doors?"
1074,1074,4,Mark,False,5,Including warts and skin tags.
1075,1075,4,Mark,False,3,Forty-one! I win.
1076,1076,4,Mark,True,8,What do I win? Most physically defective male?
1077,1077,4,Mark,False,1,Sure.
1078,1078,4,Mark,False,16,"Well, I thought his service game seemed a little off, but I didn't like to crow."
1079,1079,4,Mark,False,2,How interesting.
1080,1080,4,Mark,True,6,Do I detect a mental defect?
1081,1081,4,Mark,False,4,"April, that- that's awful!"
1082,1082,4,Mark,True,8,"I smell it, the sweet stench of weakness."
1083,1083,4,Mark,True,9,"All aboard the Coconut Express. Next stop, Loony Town!"
1084,1084,4,Mark,True,8,"This is nice, isn't it? A goodly stroll."
1085,1085,4,Mark,True,24,"Invite him out for a walk, lure him to a Greek Orthodox church, precipitate am insanity spiral. My plan certainly has become quite Byzantine!"
1086,1086,4,Mark,False,12,Oh... yeah. We went for a little check-up. The old mole patrol.
1087,1087,4,Mark,True,4,Is this a walloping?
1088,1088,4,Mark,False,1,Right.
1089,1089,4,Mark,False,4,"Yeah, no, sounds great."
1090,1090,4,Mark,True,6,Rectal exams with the love rival?
1091,1091,4,Mark,True,11,Tell me your wife's secret desires. They'll be safe with me.
1092,1092,4,Mark,False,16,"Say, that's- that's an interesting church. Is it Russian? Yes, a Russian Orthodox church. How fascinating."
1093,1093,4,Mark,False,12,"OK, well, I propose a wager, good sir. Loser buys the ploughman's?"
1094,1094,4,Mark,True,19,"Oh, I'll buy you a ploughman's, Angus, but it'll be the last ploughman's you eat as a sane man."
1095,1095,4,Mark,True,10,"Put on the tap shoes, quick dance on his grave."
1096,1096,4,Mark,False,19,"And is there a comprehensive history of the Byzantine church you could recommend, you know, for the general reader?"
1097,1097,4,Mark,False,27,"Right. 'Cause you've got Simon Baker on Rome and Karen Armstrong on the Western Christian tradition, but nothing on the Byzantine church? Doesn't that just seem insane?"
1098,1098,4,Mark,True,19,"This isn't horrible. I'm just encouraging him. Follow your dream, Angus, all the way into the big mind mincer."
1099,1099,4,Mark,True,29,"God, this really is interesting. No! Don't get sucked in! Otherwise it's going to be me and Angus sleeping in a Turkish hostel, reading scripture and getting rectal exams."
1100,1100,4,Mark,True,29,"Cup of tea and a Twirl. Finally get a proper look at my arse. Yep, there he is, that's my arse all right. The dark side of the moon."
1101,1101,4,Mark,False,14,"That's not from me, Jeremy. That's from the bank. It's a standard loan statement."
1102,1102,4,Mark,False,5,"Yes, Jeremy. Yes, I do."
1103,1103,4,Mark,False,6,You've wanted this office since yesterday.
1104,1104,4,Mark,False,1,Ha!
1105,1105,4,Mark,False,21,"The ombudsman isn't a person, Jeremy, it's a toothless regulatory body made up of junior and often very obliging civil servants."
1106,1106,4,Mark,False,10,"You know, Angus would have been more than welcome to-"
1107,1107,4,Mark,False,5,Oh! April... you are joking!
1108,1108,4,Mark,True,1,Ting!
1109,1109,4,Mark,False,37,"Look, I- I didn't want to dob him in, but we went for a stroll and... it was like he couldn't help himself. I mean, we went for a ploughman's afterwards, but the mood was pretty sombre."
1110,1110,4,Mark,True,7,So I ate both his pickled onions!
1111,1111,4,Mark,False,25,"You know, April, it's at times like this when I just want to throw my hands up and say, ""Let's take drugs and go crazy!"""
1112,1112,4,Mark,True,4,"Oh, God, help me."
1113,1113,4,Mark,False,10,"Yeah, no... that's great. Some lovely fat lines of... chang."
1114,1114,4,Mark,False,17,"It's leftovers for Super Hans' stag. But it's good shit. It's real top-quality, taste the difference shit."
1115,1115,4,Mark,True,10,"Eye of the tiger. Fuck you, everyone! Fuck you, Dad!"
1116,1116,4,Mark,False,10,"Ah... Mmm! Delicious, as always. Mein compliments to the chef."
1117,1117,4,Mark,True,35,Christ! It's gone all the way up my nose and into my throat! Doesn't taste very nice. What if it's off? What if my head swells up like a melon and I never sleep again?
1118,1118,4,Mark,False,22,"I feel completely normal. But also, a bit like I want to karate-chop my hand through a very high stack of poppadoms."
1119,1119,4,Mark,False,2,Kung food!
1120,1120,4,Mark,True,7,I have never been this intensely funny.
1121,1121,4,Mark,False,19,"Oh, tedious. I mean... I don't even want another line. The last thing I feel like is another line."
1122,1122,4,Mark,True,6,"Well, that's it. I'm an addict."
1123,1123,4,Mark,False,11,"But that was actually, probably, my favourite line of the two."
1124,1124,4,Mark,True,14,"God, she's trying to patch things up with Angus. God, my teeth are dry!"
1125,1125,4,Mark,False,12,"April, if I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times."
1126,1126,4,Mark,True,6,First time I've ever said it.
1127,1127,4,Mark,False,28,"You've gotta live in the moment 'cause right now I feel like staying up all night, or running to Thornton Heath, or throwing my iPad out the window."
1128,1128,4,Mark,False,8,"Yeah? I mean, which? 'Cause I'll do it."
1129,1129,4,Mark,False,17,"Yeah, 'cause it's just an iPad. I mean, what is it, really? Just some very thin microchips."
1130,1130,4,Mark,False,20,I'm going to do it. Don't you think I should do it? I'm totally doing it. Should I do it?
1131,1131,4,Mark,False,4,I'm totally doing it.
1132,1132,4,Mark,True,10,Regretting act of spontaneity before I've completed act of spontaneity.
1133,1133,4,Mark,False,4,"Bye-bye! Fuck you, iPad!"
1134,1134,4,Mark,False,2,I know.
1135,1135,4,Mark,False,2,Mark Smash!
1136,1136,4,Mark,True,4,She thinks I'm funny.
1137,1137,4,Mark,False,2,Mark Smash!
1138,1138,4,Mark,True,3,"Oh, my God!"
1139,1139,4,Mark,True,19,"I've kissed her. I've kissed her on coke. If we take smack, maybe she'll get divorced and marry me."
1140,1140,4,Mark,True,21,I need something new to throw out the window before April loses interest. Could bung my George Foreman off the balcony.
1141,1141,4,Mark,True,27,"Oh, it's grudge time with Jerry. When is he ever going to forgive me for bundling him into a sleeping bag and throwing him in a lift?"
1142,1142,4,Mark,False,7,"Oh! Angus, uh... hi. I wasn't expecting-"
1143,1143,4,Mark,False,2,Sounds perfect.
1144,1144,4,Mark,True,7,Inflating my colon like a weather balloon?
1145,1145,4,Mark,False,14,"Sure. Sure, it might. Well, let me just enter your details into the system."
1146,1146,4,Mark,True,18,"Look at me. I'm ""entering his details into the system"". Telephone, telephone, sunglasses, smiley face, crucifix, and ""enter."""
1147,1147,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh, Angus, your credit rating is, frankly, sub-Grecian."
1148,1148,4,Mark,False,7,"Mate, I'm- I'm sorry. It's a no."
1149,1149,4,Mark,True,18,"Three-way spite-feast! No commission for me, no cruise for April, no marriage for Angus. And it tastes great!"
1150,1150,4,Mark,False,6,"Jeremy, what are you talking about?"
1151,1151,4,Mark,False,7,A pub man? I- I'm getting robbed?
1152,1152,4,Mark,False,12,"What do you mean, no shooting? I was going to get shot?"
1153,1153,4,Mark,False,20,"Oh, and no one ever goes over a red line, do they, Jeremy? Tuition fees was a fucking red line."
1154,1154,4,Mark,False,6,"You took it? Jesus Christ, Jeremy!"
1155,1155,4,Mark,False,18,"No, Jeremy, it isn't. It's a victimy crime, and the victim is me! I'm going to get shot."
1156,1156,4,Mark,False,14,"Oh, I'm sorry, Jeremy. I'm sorry for being all self-pitying about my potential shooting!"
1157,1157,4,Mark,False,5,What's that supposed to mean?
1158,1158,4,Mark,False,20,"Oh, great. I'm due one, am I? I'm due a good shooting? Its my turn for the big, shiny bullet?"
1159,1159,4,Mark,False,27,Is... is that him? Is that the robber? Shit! Where's the panic button? I can't find the panic button. I'm panicking and I can't find the panic-
1160,1160,4,Mark,False,11,Why do they make these bloody things so hard to find?
1161,1161,4,Mark,False,29,"Exactly. He's a nutter, Jeremy. A nutter who may or may not have got the memo re. not shooting me. He's queuing. Why is he queuing? Robbers don't queue."
1162,1162,4,Mark,False,5,What if he shoots everyone?
1163,1163,4,Mark,True,23,I'm not running away. I'm just walking over here to reassess the situation. All the way over here and out of the back.
1164,1164,4,Mark,False,15,What? What am I doing? I need to go back in! Wha- What about Angus?
1165,1165,4,Mark,False,14,A muffin? You're going to stand here waiting for a massacre eating a muffin?
1166,1166,4,Mark,False,1,Unbelievable.
1167,1167,4,Mark,False,8,"Uh, flat white extra hot and a biscotti."
1168,1168,4,Mark,False,10,But this is on you! I'm holding you fully accountable.
1169,1169,4,Mark,False,14,Soz is not an appropriate level of apology for facilitating an armed fucking robbery.
1170,1170,4,Mark,False,1,What?
1171,1171,4,Mark,False,10,"Oh, Christ! No, I'm not doing a fucking Prince Philip!"
1172,1172,4,Mark,False,15,"Really, Jeremy? Tell me more 'cause I'm so invested in your domestic horseshit right now."
1173,1173,4,Mark,False,9,"Oh, hi, Alan. Just on a quick coffee run."
1174,1174,4,Mark,False,4,What about my coffee?
1175,1175,4,Mark,False,4,"Jeremy, are you coming?"
1176,1176,4,Mark,False,12,Right. Off I go. On my own. Off on my merry way.
1177,1177,4,Mark,True,24,"No one seems dead. It's a promising start. Oh, God! Here he goes. Oh, he's bottled it! He's just a big, beardy pen thief."
1178,1178,4,Mark,False,7,"Brilliant, Angus. I- I'm happy for you."
1179,1179,4,Mark,False,2,"Thanks, Jerry."
1180,1180,4,Mark,True,18,"Commission for Jerry, cruise for April, marriage for Angus. Get the pub man back. I want my shooting!"
1181,1181,5,Mark,True,3,"Education, education, education."
1182,1182,5,Mark,False,13,"Oh, yeah Got some new Mandarin flash cards. Taking it up a level"
1183,1183,5,Mark,False,30,"I'm turning Ian into a super toddler, the chocolate reward in sight but always just out of reach. He is going to learn to defer his gratification so damn hard."
1184,1184,5,Mark,False,17,I don't know. Sort of all at once when I finally dive into to my pension pot.
1185,1185,5,Mark,True,9,I'd never masturbate into cashmere. A nightmare to wash!
1186,1186,5,Mark,False,4,"Oh, hi, Sophie. Where's?"
1187,1187,5,Mark,False,29,But I've been preparing all sorts of great IQ games. I've stuffed a piñata. It's filled with nature facts with the odd carob-covered raisin to keep his morale up.
1188,1188,5,Mark,False,19,"This isn't America, Sophie. I don't keep random beers in. I might have some rum, but you probably don't..."
1189,1189,5,Mark,True,5,She's a bit rum keen.
1190,1190,5,Mark,False,7,"So, What happened? What happened with Ian?"
1191,1191,5,Mark,True,15,"I love Duncan! Sexless, unthreatening Duncan, teaching him maths and tag-teaming the Mandarin flash cards."
1192,1192,5,Mark,False,14,"Oh. OK, because since Duncan's been around, Ian's scores have been through the roof."
1193,1193,5,Mark,False,23,"No! I mean, yes. Just a bit of basic intelligence testing. I do it to me and Jez too, just to keep track."
1194,1194,5,Mark,False,14,Of course! When I saw how Ian could hold a pen I nearly shat.
1195,1195,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
1196,1196,5,Mark,False,18,"Well, I think you shouldn't be too hasty. Maybe everything will run its course with Duncan and Alison."
1197,1197,5,Mark,False,13,"I just think Duncan sounds like a real catch, and people are multifaceted."
1198,1198,5,Mark,True,13,Just let him get Ian started on the viola and or ancient Greek.
1199,1199,5,Mark,False,11,Do you want some bread to go with that? As ballast?
1200,1200,5,Mark,False,3,"Well, thank you."
1201,1201,5,Mark,False,5,Happy to be of service.
1202,1202,5,Mark,True,5,Stop calling me your ballast.
1203,1203,5,Mark,False,6,"I'm sorry, how do you mean?"
1204,1204,5,Mark,True,6,Let's see how she likes it.
1205,1205,5,Mark,False,5,"You're my ballast too, Sophie."
1206,1206,5,Mark,True,13,Think I'll be saying no to a lifetime of passive aggressive mutual ballast-calling.
1207,1207,5,Mark,False,1,April?
1208,1208,5,Mark,True,7,"Talk, yeah? Very quietly at the door?"
1209,1209,5,Mark,False,1,OK.
1210,1210,5,Mark,True,9,"Do come in and meet my ex-wife, the drunk."
1211,1211,5,Mark,False,3,"Um, sorry, just..."
1212,1212,5,Mark,True,6,Get this shit off the table!
1213,1213,5,Mark,True,7,Are we having sex on the table?
1214,1214,5,Mark,True,3,"Not wrong, right!"
1215,1215,5,Mark,False,25,"Look, can we talk tomorrow? I'm taking my son to a play centre, The Kid Kave. You could bring your niece. It might be fun."
1216,1216,5,Mark,True,21,"Oh, knife in the guts! Goodbye, April. Let the dream crumble. Lovely, crumbly dream that I can't even eat with custard."
1217,1217,5,Mark,False,4,"Someone from, the past."
1218,1218,5,Mark,False,5,Yes. But it wasn't Napoleon.
1219,1219,5,Mark,True,37,"Butter the toast, eat the toast, shit the toast. God, life's relentless. The April door closes, the Sophie door opens. The loveless marriage. Cut off the cock and stick it in a jar. Might be a relief."
1220,1220,5,Mark,False,1,Jez...
1221,1221,5,Mark,False,32,"And would an aggressive campaign to claim shared credit for the lyrics on a little bit of song on an internet football video make you look like a winner, would you say?"
1222,1222,5,Mark,False,23,I really think you need to let this go. Take the advice of a man who's been scientifically proven to have above-average intelligence.
1223,1223,5,Mark,False,5,A hundred and thirty-three IQ.
1224,1224,5,Mark,True,32,So what if I had a bit of help? It's only the dunderheads with their low IQ's who don't figure out the way to win is looking stuff up on the Internet.
1225,1225,5,Mark,False,10,"Oh, really? And what's three times a hundred and thirty-three?"
1226,1226,5,Mark,False,22,Do you think he might be taking advantage of you because you're mentally subnormal and have a brain the size of pea?
1227,1227,5,Mark,False,17,"The lyrics you want to claim credit for, that's the electronic voice saying ""ATOL protected, ATOL protected""?"
1228,1228,5,Mark,True,1,Inspired.
1229,1229,5,Mark,False,2,Copied them.
1230,1230,5,Mark,False,4,That sounds very believable.
1231,1231,5,Mark,False,37,"Yeah, well, April's kaput maybe that's just life, your expectations get ground down and down until finally you settle for a life that would have mortified you twenty years ago but now seems like a blessed relief."
1232,1232,5,Mark,False,1,Mm.
1233,1233,5,Mark,False,26,"My recollection so far as it goes is that Jeremy did indeed make a significant contribution to the lyrics in question, i.e. the words 'ATOL Protected'."
1234,1234,5,Mark,False,7,"Sort of like dry, old Italian cake."
1235,1235,5,Mark,False,11,"Um, my recollection so far as it goes Is that Jeremy..."
1236,1236,5,Mark,False,6,He might but I definitely won't.
1237,1237,5,Mark,False,12,"Come on Jez, let's go. I've to get to the Kid Kave."
1238,1238,5,Mark,True,2,Below-average IQ.
1239,1239,5,Mark,False,17,"It's like cracking Enigma, isn't it? Looking under all the different flowerpots. Oh Christ Jez, not burgling."
1240,1240,5,Mark,False,19,"OK, I'm here to borrow a brolly. If anyone comes, I'm saying I popped in to borrow a brolly."
1241,1241,5,Mark,False,3,That is inconvenient.
1242,1242,5,Mark,False,3,"OK, I'm going."
1243,1243,5,Mark,True,10,"Oh, Jesus, I'm a backup burglar. I'm a burglar's PA."
1244,1244,5,Mark,False,19,"No, Jeremy really? Goldfish in the Shreddies? Is that your budget version of a horse's head in the bed?"
1245,1245,5,Mark,False,8,"Well, for God's sake leave the snake alone."
1246,1246,5,Mark,True,6,And the IQ testing is complete.
1247,1247,5,Mark,False,19,If I could go back in time maybe I wouldn't have split up with Sophie in the first place.
1248,1248,5,Mark,False,15,"So many choices, Periclean Athens, Egypt under Ramesses the first, the Ziggurat of Ur, God!"
1249,1249,5,Mark,False,13,"The 1950s? Jeremy, I'm talking about seeing a civilisation that is unimaginably different."
1250,1250,5,Mark,False,14,"But Socrates? If you went for 14 AD, you could nab Augustus and Jesus."
1251,1251,5,Mark,False,1,Nah?
1252,1252,5,Mark,False,8,"Jeremy, you can literally still do exactly that."
1253,1253,5,Mark,False,12,"Oh, it looks fun! You can have a cappuccino while they play."
1254,1254,5,Mark,False,17,"Better than that fucking park, mate. You really want to kill yourself at the park, all right?"
1255,1255,5,Mark,False,18,"It's a real three piper. If I say yes, I'll regret it, that's certain. Claustrophobic, depressing, mouldering resentment."
1256,1256,5,Mark,False,17,"But if I say no, I'll also definitely regret it. Overwhelming feelings of regret, guilt and sadness."
1257,1257,5,Mark,True,3,"Wow, my son."
1258,1258,5,Mark,False,12,"Hi, Ian. Ian Ian Ian Ian. How are you doing, little fella?"
1259,1259,5,Mark,True,5,Flicker of recognition? Basically uninterested.
1260,1260,5,Mark,True,16,"Ugh the high five, like the grey squirrel, it will drive the hand-shake to extinction eventually."
1261,1261,5,Mark,True,5,"Ian, It's all about Ian."
1262,1262,5,Mark,False,6,You know what? Let's do it.
1263,1263,5,Mark,False,7,"Screw it, let's give it a go."
1264,1264,5,Mark,False,5,I think maybe it might.
1265,1265,5,Mark,False,1,Very
1266,1266,5,Mark,True,11,What this phlegm has put together let no man break asunder.
1267,1267,5,Mark,False,3,"Ha ha, OK."
1268,1268,5,Mark,False,5,No! I'm excited. It's exciting.
1269,1269,5,Mark,True,14,The first of the million lies that are gonna make up our terrible relationship.
1270,1270,5,Mark,True,8,"What have I done?, what have I done?"
1271,1271,5,Mark,False,3,I said yes.
1272,1272,5,Mark,False,1,Leftovers?
1273,1273,5,Mark,False,7,Can't you just bank the YouTube money?
1274,1274,5,Mark,False,8,What the fuck is that? What's in there?
1275,1275,5,Mark,False,7,Your bag just moved. What have you-?
1276,1276,5,Mark,False,9,You brought a snake to a children's play centre?
1277,1277,5,Mark,False,3,Is it venomous?
1278,1278,5,Mark,False,4,It didn't look venomous?
1279,1279,5,Mark,False,16,And what about now that it's been confined to the bag for a couple of hours?
1280,1280,5,Mark,False,10,This children's play centre is your designated snake handover arena.
1281,1281,5,Mark,False,6,April! What are you doing here?
1282,1282,5,Mark,True,2,She came.
1283,1283,5,Mark,False,2,"Hello, Hayley-"
1284,1284,5,Mark,False,3,take a seat.
1285,1285,5,Mark,True,3,She actually came.
1286,1286,5,Mark,True,1,Cuckoo!
1287,1287,5,Mark,False,7,"Yes, well, that's just how I roll."
1288,1288,5,Mark,True,9,"Finally I'm the Ferrari, and he's the fucking Volvo."
1289,1289,5,Mark,True,2,Oh April!
1290,1290,5,Mark,False,4,This is quite naughty.
1291,1291,5,Mark,False,1,Blimey.
1292,1292,5,Mark,True,27,"""Disabled toilet baby changing shelf."" The five sexiest words in the English language. Hope my son's OK, with Jeremy, and the snake. No be in the moment."
1293,1293,5,Mark,False,17,I don't want to break the spell but should I make haste to purchase some condoms perchance?
1294,1294,5,Mark,True,22,"I wonder what kind of OK. ""No baby"" OK or ""OK we're having a baby."" Quite interested but bit rude to ask."
1295,1295,5,Mark,False,7,That was fun! And does it mean...?
1296,1296,5,Mark,True,2,Lovely something.
1297,1297,5,Mark,False,15,"Oh, he's gone totally mental. He's saving money to spend on a never-ending court battle."
1298,1298,5,Mark,False,1,Exactly.
1299,1299,5,Mark,True,6,"Ah, April, you are the one."
1300,1300,5,Mark,False,2,"Well, I..."
1301,1301,5,Mark,False,9,"We, we just did it in the disabled loo."
1302,1302,5,Mark,False,5,April. It's gotta be April.
1303,1303,5,Mark,False,22,"Me and Sophie and Ian, it was a crazy scheme. It would probably do him so much harm, living between warring parents."
1304,1304,5,Mark,False,17,"Better call Sophie, see if she minds picking up Ian later from the flat. Where is Ian?"
1305,1305,5,Mark,False,9,I thought you were keeping an eye on him.
1306,1306,5,Mark,False,13,The least you could do is keep an eye on Ian while I-
1307,1307,5,Mark,False,2,Ian! Ian!
1308,1308,5,Mark,True,12,"Oh fuck, she's not here. We never talked. The deal never happened."
1309,1309,5,Mark,False,8,Have you been? Have you had a drink?
1310,1310,5,Mark,True,4,She just loves wine.
1311,1311,5,Mark,False,1,Oh.
1312,1312,5,Mark,True,3,It's definitely mental.
1313,1313,5,Mark,False,25,"Look why don't I call you a cab and you can go home and then we can have a big chat about everything later, yeah?"
1314,1314,5,Mark,False,15,"No, Soph, I need to find Ian. I should never have left him with Jez."
1315,1315,5,Mark,False,2,Ian! Ian!
1316,1316,5,Mark,False,1,Ian?
1317,1317,5,Mark,True,7,Oh this is murder on my back.
1318,1318,5,Mark,False,16,The naughty lady likes funny words cos she's feeling funny. Have you seen a little boy?
1319,1319,5,Mark,False,3,He's not answering.
1320,1320,5,Mark,False,10,Why aren't you answering? What have you done with him?
1321,1321,5,Mark,False,1,Ian!
1322,1322,5,Mark,False,11,"Noted. Oh, this is a disaster. What's if he hurt himself?"
1323,1323,5,Mark,False,9,What if he's wandered out through an emergency exit?
1324,1324,5,Mark,False,12,"They lock the emergency exit, what if there's a fire? Oh, Christ!"
1325,1325,5,Mark,False,22,"OK, you have a lie down in the ball pit. I'll find Ian and then we'll have a big chat about everything."
1326,1326,5,Mark,True,28,A big chat during which I'll reverse out of our agreement as elegantly as a man backing his car into the entire peloton of the Tour de France.
1327,1327,5,Mark,True,15,"Urgh, I've lost my child. I'm such a terrible, terrible human in every single respect."
1328,1328,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, good."
1329,1329,5,Mark,False,1,What?
1330,1330,5,Mark,False,15,"Yeah. Who could believe a snake would be so duplicitous? They're so famously reliable, snakes."
1331,1331,5,Mark,True,2,So reassuring.
1332,1332,5,Mark,False,45,"It's Ian. I can't find him anywhere. So many bloody kids. I need to somehow get them all cleared out. Maybe shout ""fire"" or I could tell the staff that you were a famous paedo. That would clear the place like Jaws at the beach."
1333,1333,5,Mark,False,24,"What? You're very famous and easy about labels. You don't mind a bit of a ""bad boy"" rep. I need to talk to Sophie."
1334,1334,5,Mark,False,1,Soph?
1335,1335,5,Mark,False,31,She's out cold. Oh God April! She can't see my sort of wife who I've sort of agreed to get back together with and is sort of a total fucking mess.
1336,1336,5,Mark,False,3,Bury the body?
1337,1337,5,Mark,False,5,She's pretty much already buried.
1338,1338,5,Mark,True,9,This is fine. It's just a nice multicoloured siesta.
1339,1339,5,Mark,True,12,"OK, good. This is good. Bury Sophie, find Ian, leave with April."
1340,1340,5,Mark,False,7,"Of course, the air holes are numerous."
1341,1341,5,Mark,False,7,Just need to weigh her down more.
1342,1342,5,Mark,False,9,"Great! Although, do you think he witnessed the burial?"
1343,1343,5,Mark,True,16,"He looks OK. That's right son, push it all down. My pension can go on therapy."
1344,1344,5,Mark,False,1,Hi.
1345,1345,5,Mark,False,16,Oh God. Well let's get the hell out of here. Back to mine for a wine?
1346,1346,5,Mark,False,5,"Me too, April. Me too."
1347,1347,5,Mark,True,2,Oh God.
1348,1348,5,Mark,False,9,"That's fine... I imagine. Probably some funny, buried clown."
1349,1349,5,Mark,True,8,"Ugh, I should have used some more balls."
1350,1350,5,Mark,False,4,I didn't bury you.
1351,1351,5,Mark,False,16,It's OK. Probably been in there for months. Just some kind of homeless ball pit witch.
1352,1352,5,Mark,True,11,Burying your wife alive. It just has such an unfortunate ring.
1353,1353,5,Mark,False,1,Saying?
1354,1354,5,Mark,False,1,Hmm.
1355,1355,6,Mark,False,13,"Hmm, you don't have one that just says ""you are forty years old""?"
1356,1356,6,Mark,False,12,"No, I want one that reads ""Jeremy, you are forty years old."""
1357,1357,6,Mark,False,7,I think it rounds it off nicely.
1358,1358,6,Mark,True,12,I'm gonna make Jeremy turn forty whether he likes it or not.
1359,1359,6,Mark,False,6,Do you have a fax machine?
1360,1360,6,Mark,False,29,"I know, wilfully perverse. But I'm trying to get in touch with someone who, for whatever reason, won't return my calls. I'm not some oddball though. It's not worrying."
1361,1361,6,Mark,True,12,Good to let him know it's not worrying. He can't worry now.
1362,1362,6,Mark,True,8,I'm kidding myself. April's never gonna call me.
1363,1363,6,Mark,True,18,Of course she won't call me. I made the fatal error of letting her get to know me.
1364,1364,6,Mark,False,2,You OK?
1365,1365,6,Mark,False,8,"Ooh, your favourite. Celebration for the birthday boy?"
1366,1366,6,Mark,False,2,"No, mate."
1367,1367,6,Mark,False,8,"Well, I'm definitely not planning one so relax."
1368,1368,6,Mark,True,11,"You're going to have a party to remember, my elderly friend."
1369,1369,6,Mark,False,1,Why?
1370,1370,6,Mark,False,2,Not entirely.
1371,1371,6,Mark,False,4,I think I see.
1372,1372,6,Mark,False,6,"You're just saying numbers now, Jeremy."
1373,1373,6,Mark,False,10,"Oh, a sprout sandwich. Are you on a health kick?"
1374,1374,6,Mark,False,1,Why?
1375,1375,6,Mark,False,6,Is this his? The Golden Fountain?
1376,1376,6,Mark,False,1,Piss?
1377,1377,6,Mark,False,13,That your body was too foolish to extract at first time of asking.
1378,1378,6,Mark,False,10,"I don't know, Jeremy. Because you just made them up?"
1379,1379,6,Mark,True,4,Drinking your own piss?
1380,1380,6,Mark,False,11,"The golden fountain. Come on, Jez. What's next? The chocolate factory?"
1381,1381,6,Mark,True,9,"He's got the book, but he'd never actually- urgh!"
1382,1382,6,Mark,False,9,"Oh God, you're not keeping it in the fridge?"
1383,1383,6,Mark,False,6,I need to head to work.
1384,1384,6,Mark,False,19,"Emergency meeting. Special project or something. Johnson seemed very jazzed. Oh, not with a sandwich. Not as your drink."
1385,1385,6,Mark,False,5,"Fine. Goodbye, Rip Van Wankle."
1386,1386,6,Mark,True,14,I'm wasted on him. I should be living with Graham Norton and Dorothy Parker.
1387,1387,6,Mark,False,11,"Hey, Alan. What's up, captain? What's the skinny on the dope?"
1388,1388,6,Mark,False,2,Mr. Corrigan?
1389,1389,6,Mark,True,12,Do I smell corporate lube? Am I about to get organisationally fucked?
1390,1390,6,Mark,False,10,"Is that Baker from regional? What- what is this, Alan?"
1391,1391,6,Mark,False,6,Is this about the permanent markers?
1392,1392,6,Mark,False,8,"Because I needed them at home, for projects."
1393,1393,6,Mark,False,1,Jeff?!
1394,1394,6,Mark,False,6,What? But can't you do anything?
1395,1395,6,Mark,True,8,"No, Alan. Remember all the good times, Alan."
1396,1396,6,Mark,False,6,I'm sorry. Which loan was this?
1397,1397,6,Mark,False,4,What complaint? Who complained?
1398,1398,6,Mark,False,28,But I can get the money back! I know him! I can get it back! I'll jam a biro in his eye and drag him in here today!
1399,1399,6,Mark,True,5,Shafted by a piss addict.
1400,1400,6,Mark,True,17,"I'm hung out to try. I'm human laundry. Urgh, Jeff, Jerry, and Johnson. A trilogy of shits."
1401,1401,6,Mark,False,2,Jeremy. Jeremy!
1402,1402,6,Mark,False,18,I just wanted to let you know that I am now going to punch you on the nose.
1403,1403,6,Mark,True,11,"Cold brown. No job, no woman, no jam, just cold brown."
1404,1404,6,Mark,True,9,"I love the silent treatment. The cold, impervious wall."
1405,1405,6,Mark,True,13,He's not luring me back in like that with a lovely savage argument.
1406,1406,6,Mark,True,4,"Appealing, but no dice."
1407,1407,6,Mark,True,7,"He wouldn't. Not my lovely, white milk."
1408,1408,6,Mark,True,3,He's milking me.
1409,1409,6,Mark,True,12,He's got his hands on my udders and he's actually milking me.
1410,1410,6,Mark,True,16,I will prevail. He can't hurt me with his Rice Krispie blitz. London can take it.
1411,1411,6,Mark,True,10,April? God love the fax and all the old ways.
1412,1412,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1413,1413,6,Mark,False,8,"I understand. Well, thanks for calling. Goodbye, April."
1414,1414,6,Mark,False,16,"Super Hans, will you please inform your friend, Specimen A, that I'm not talking to him."
1415,1415,6,Mark,False,14,"Well, likewise. April's gone back to her husband. For good. It's over. Everything's over."
1416,1416,6,Mark,False,10,"Is there a buzzing? An irritating, backstabbing sort of buzzing?"
1417,1417,6,Mark,False,10,"He wanted his loan written off and well, he succeeded."
1418,1418,6,Mark,False,8,But he's lost a friend in the process.
1419,1419,6,Mark,False,51,"Look, Hans, can you shut up? Because as we speak, the love of my life is buying cruise tickets with her husband on the High Street with the intention of sailing away forever and I'd very much like to sit here and watch a property-based reality show while she does it."
1420,1420,6,Mark,False,26,"If I wanted to stop her, the last person I'd ask for help is the most thoughtless, selfish, venal idiot I've ever met in my life."
1421,1421,6,Mark,True,14,"Hm, I suppose it might be better than having a cry and a Cornetto."
1422,1422,6,Mark,False,7,I haven't forgiven you by the way.
1423,1423,6,Mark,False,7,I just want it to be clear.
1424,1424,6,Mark,False,1,Good.
1425,1425,6,Mark,False,2,As in?
1426,1426,6,Mark,False,11,Why does every solution you come up with involve fucking someone?
1427,1427,6,Mark,False,23,Do you think they sit around in the cabinet talking about sending Philip Hammond over to fuck Hollande to sort out the Euro?
1428,1428,6,Mark,False,6,It does look a little testy.
1429,1429,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
1430,1430,6,Mark,False,6,Oh fuck! I'm gonna do something.
1431,1431,6,Mark,False,6,I don't know what you mean.
1432,1432,6,Mark,False,7,This still doesn't mean I've forgiven you.
1433,1433,6,Mark,False,1,April!
1434,1434,6,Mark,False,5,I just bumped into you.
1435,1435,6,Mark,False,25,"No, right, I mean, I just... look, could we grab a coffee for five minutes? I've got a couple of things I need to say."
1436,1436,6,Mark,True,13,Got the coffee. Disregard the price. The price of the coffee is irrelevant.
1437,1437,6,Mark,False,19,"No biggie. I mean, God knows how they can charge so much. They're certainly not spending it on lampshades."
1438,1438,6,Mark,True,9,"Hello, dad. You're living inside me now, are you?"
1439,1439,6,Mark,False,6,"Oh, not Corfu. Why not Corfu?"
1440,1440,6,Mark,True,3,He asked innocently.
1441,1441,6,Mark,False,18,"Oh, of course. Sorry, I'd forgotten. Sorry to drag all that up again, all the resentment, sorry. Idiot."
1442,1442,6,Mark,False,80,"Anyway, what I wanted to say, just before you go, and if you want me to stop, just say, but yeah, I basically think that you're just so funny, and clever, and brilliant, and I really am sorry if that makes things difficult, but I think it's only fair that you should know that I think we'd be great together. I mean, I know I'm not perfect. In fact, I'm not even probably average. I'm a misshapen potato, an oddball."
1443,1443,6,Mark,True,5,"Feel free to disagree, April."
1444,1444,6,Mark,False,31,"I'm mean-spirited and I only really like hearing about other people's holidays when they've been disastrous. But I really, really like you. In fact, in all honesty, I... I love you."
1445,1445,6,Mark,False,9,"Ex-wife and more hiding than burying, but point taken."
1446,1446,6,Mark,True,1,Feelings!
1447,1447,6,Mark,False,6,Of course you do. Who wouldn't?
1448,1448,6,Mark,True,11,"Three hundred quid pissed straight out the porthole? Correct call, Angus."
1449,1449,6,Mark,False,1,What?
1450,1450,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, oh right."
1451,1451,6,Mark,True,10,Furrow the brow. Furrow the brow to hide the smile.
1452,1452,6,Mark,True,1,Alone?
1453,1453,6,Mark,True,26,I've won. It's like I'm Napoleon invading Moscow and the Tsar's fucked off to Ibiza! I've conquered the whole of Russia! I've only gone and won.
1454,1454,6,Mark,False,18,Everything's coming up roses. April and I just had an overpriced coffee and did it in the toilets.
1455,1455,6,Mark,False,31,"April loves doing it in toilets. In fact, a hundred percent of the times we've done it, we've done it in toilets. I can't wait to do it in the bed."
1456,1456,6,Mark,False,40,"But the big news is that Angus texted to say that he's fucked off to Ibiza, of all places, leaving the coast clear for me to go off with his wife on, the cruise. Me and April, April and me!"
1457,1457,6,Mark,False,42,"Look, I just wanted to say I know things have been a bit difficult between us over the last day or so, what with the punching and the blanking, but you're a good friend, although I still haven't totally forgiven you, mate."
1458,1458,6,Mark,False,1,Eh!
1459,1459,6,Mark,False,3,What was that?
1460,1460,6,Mark,False,6,What the fuck have you done?
1461,1461,6,Mark,True,2,Fuck. Angus.
1462,1462,6,Mark,False,5,"Jesus. Angus, are you OK?"
1463,1463,6,Mark,False,11,"Angus, you must know I had nothing to do with this."
1464,1464,6,Mark,False,5,Did you send the texts?
1465,1465,6,Mark,False,7,"What the fuck have you done, Jeremy?"
1466,1466,6,Mark,False,17,The coast is not clear. We're all going to prison. You've gone totally loopy. You kidnapped Angus!
1467,1467,6,Mark,False,7,This is bad. This is really bad.
1468,1468,6,Mark,False,12,"Yes, until she finds out. I mean, what's the long term plan?"
1469,1469,6,Mark,False,8,Sucky fucky is not a long term plan!
1470,1470,6,Mark,False,6,"Hmm, she does hate her phone."
1471,1471,6,Mark,False,11,I think we let him go and I take the hit.
1472,1472,6,Mark,False,10,Fuck it! All right. Leave him in there for now.
1473,1473,6,Mark,False,3,Oh. Er... surprise!
1474,1474,6,Mark,False,9,I thought you were just hiding your true feelings.
1475,1475,6,Mark,False,8,I'm not doing a shift. This is insane.
1476,1476,6,Mark,False,1,April?
1477,1477,6,Mark,True,4,Tell her we're leaving.
1478,1478,6,Mark,False,5,How the hell are you?
1479,1479,6,Mark,True,11,Oh God she's coming in. Just act normal. Don't arouse suspicion.
1480,1480,6,Mark,False,2,Oh yeah.
1481,1481,6,Mark,True,4,Don't open the door.
1482,1482,6,Mark,True,9,"She didn't see, she didn't see. Calm down, Mark."
1483,1483,6,Mark,True,8,He's not a kangaroo. He's an eminent theologian.
1484,1484,6,Mark,False,14,Come on in. Thanks for coming. Put that in the fridge if you want.
1485,1485,6,Mark,False,27,"Sorry, but when I was doing the invites, it became clear that you've betrayed everyone you've ever been close to. I think that's why the majority declined."
1486,1486,6,Mark,False,3,Go on through.
1487,1487,6,Mark,False,19,"I wouldn't say we were scraping the barrel, but well, you've just not been great at keeping in touch."
1488,1488,6,Mark,True,5,Oh shit. Filibuster. Don't turn.
1489,1489,6,Mark,False,19,Great. I tell you what I would like to do for Jeremy is... a... filibuster. I mean... a speech!
1490,1490,6,Mark,True,9,"Ugh, now I've got to make a fucking speech!"
1491,1491,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1492,1492,6,Mark,True,7,Here goes. Quick speech and then cruise.
1493,1493,6,Mark,False,12,"Jeremy, what can I say? A man I know very well indeed."
1494,1494,6,Mark,True,13,That's probably as far as I can truthfully go on the endearment stakes.
1495,1495,6,Mark,False,17,"Um, he's not a great man. He's not a wise man. He's not always a good man."
1496,1496,6,Mark,True,5,"OK, where am I going?"
1497,1497,6,Mark,False,14,"But he is a nice man, up to a point, and I... like him."
1498,1498,6,Mark,True,7,"There, I've said it. Hope he's happy."
1499,1499,6,Mark,True,5,He loves triggering mental illness.
1500,1500,6,Mark,True,17,"Hold on. If Hans is here, who's with the hostage? Oh God, I've got an unattended hostage!"
1501,1501,6,Mark,True,7,"Oh fuck, got to keep the attention."
1502,1502,6,Mark,False,19,"Yeah, and if I could just say one more thing. Um, Jeremy, Jez, please always keep on being you."
1503,1503,6,Mark,True,7,Totally meaningless. I'm going to get rumbled.
1504,1504,6,Mark,True,6,"Oh fuck! Oh fuck, oh fuck!"
1505,1505,6,Mark,True,19,Who could have possibly predicted that falsely imprisoning a love rival would turn out so badly? Only a genius.
1506,1506,6,Mark,False,3,"April, don't go!"
1507,1507,6,Mark,True,8,"A real night to remember, like the Titanic."
1508,1508,6,Mark,False,11,That's the last thing I need. Now they're bringing back wolves.
1509,1509,6,Mark,False,21,"What next? Bring back smallpox? We all had fun with the smallpox, didn't we? Is it time smallpox had a reboot?"
1510,1510,6,Mark,False,22,"I'm not about to pull you off, Jeremy. And if you think about it, I'm sure you don't really want me to."
1511,1511,6,Mark,False,9,What about I read to you from Napoleon's correspondence?
1512,1512,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
1513,1513,6,Mark,False,22,"Yeah, not bad, not bad at all. I think I'd just come at you in the night, pillow on the face. Cark."
1514,1514,6,Mark,True,7,I simply must get rid of him.
