0,0,1,Jeremy,False,4,Shall I go on?
1,1,1,Jeremy,False,21,"The foetal head then passes below the pubic arch. At this point, the woman may feel a burning or stinging sensation."
2,2,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Um, how much more do you want? What's an episiotomy?"
3,3,1,Jeremy,False,1,Why?
4,4,1,Jeremy,False,6,It's one of my favourite areas.
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,4,Oh my fucking life!
6,6,1,Jeremy,True,35,"So glad I'm not a woman. Worst thing that can happen to me is getting sent to war. Even then, I can find a cave and eat blackberries and tug myself off till it's over."
7,7,1,Jeremy,True,13,"Hold on, I see where this is going. I ain't no birth partner."
8,8,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Dude, you are gonna be a great birth partner!"
9,9,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, right."
10,10,1,Jeremy,True,3,Oh my life.
11,11,1,Jeremy,False,8,I mean... I suppose I always wondered whether-
12,12,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, yeah."
13,13,1,Jeremy,True,7,Act supportive or punch his lights out?
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,7,And are you gonna get help for-
15,15,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Paedophobe, oh right."
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,18,"It's just paedo, phobe. I mean, they're both bad. I thought you were saying you were a mega-paedo."
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,6,"I was grappling, I was grasping."
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,3,Chim chim cher-ee.
19,19,1,Jeremy,True,67,"God, how did he get so old? I'll never let myself get so old. I mean, you have to get old up to a point, but that's ridiculous. Still nothing from Elena. I'll never fool anyone as beautiful as Elena into loving me again. Maybe I should kill myself. Hmmm, Gary Neville's conservatory is nice. Hello, put that suicide bid on hold. OK, a book, egghead alert."
20,20,1,Jeremy,False,9,"So, er... ""The Famished Road"", is that a sequel?"
21,21,1,Jeremy,False,22,"To the one that was a film about the end of the world, ""The Road""? 'Cause they were hungry enough in that."
22,22,1,Jeremy,True,7,Didn't even know it was a one.
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Jeremy. So, what are you in for? You don't have to tell me, if it's disgusting."
24,24,1,Jeremy,True,1,Boyfriend.
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,1,Oh.
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,2,That's terrible.
27,27,1,Jeremy,True,1,Terri-brill.
28,28,1,Jeremy,False,4,"How's it going, dude?"
29,29,1,Jeremy,True,3,"Hey, that's Zahra's."
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Look, you're stressing it. How about I sort it?"
31,31,1,Jeremy,False,1,Really?
32,32,1,Jeremy,True,28,He's so lucky I'm the kind of guy who would never spike a coffee with Rohypnol. Too many practical risks before we even get into the moral considerations.
33,33,1,Jeremy,True,7,"Wow, private room, this guy's lucked out."
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Hi, Ben."
35,35,1,Jeremy,False,37,"Mm-hm, right. You know, it's funny, just looking at him, I could tell we'd get on. He looks like a laugh, a right laugh. I sort of want to shake his hand. Would that be all right?"
36,36,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Ah Ben, sleepy Ben."
37,37,1,Jeremy,True,13,"I want to steal your girlfriend, Ben. I think I love your girlfriend."
38,38,1,Jeremy,True,26,"I definitely don't hope he dies. Definitely not, that would be horrible, but he does look like he could do with a nice long relaxing coma."
39,39,1,Jeremy,False,12,"So, before the accident, how long had you two been, hanging out?"
40,40,1,Jeremy,False,10,"OK. And how was it going, were you two very...?"
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,17,"Wow, so out of those three months, you can knock off at least two weeks for training."
42,42,1,Jeremy,False,2,"God, really?"
43,43,1,Jeremy,False,21,"Oh, me too. I adore to read, it's amazing, isn't it? Because a book, I always say, can be about anything."
44,44,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, yeah."
45,45,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, sure."
46,46,1,Jeremy,False,4,"""This month's hot tip..."""
47,47,1,Jeremy,False,129,"...the premier Wrangler collection. When has good denim ever been cheap? The answer is never. Look, dude, bit of a weird one, but if you aren't gonna make it through, I mean if you can't, then don't worry, because Zahra's great. And, I'll be waiting, and if you check out, in a friendly way, not like a vulture, to check in. And don't worry, I'm not gonna start waggling on any of your tubes, but, and if you have a problem with anything I've just said then, do give me a sign. No? OK. ""I'm in a swimming pool and my bikini pops off. I'm not bothered, I'll just carry on"", and that's a comment from ""Kayleigh, Islip"". You see a picture of Kayleigh there, and her nice bum."
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, hi, Mark."
49,49,1,Jeremy,False,7,I'm reading FHM to this unconscious guy.
50,50,1,Jeremy,False,5,Because I have a heart.
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?
52,52,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?
53,53,1,Jeremy,False,4,"No, go on, what?"
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,4,What are you saying?
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Look, there's no need to be all cynical, just because-"
56,56,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, just because I'm doing something decent, there has to be some weird thing going on?"
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, cool man."
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,18,"No, kind of always wanted to see a birth. Be kind of like Alien, but sexy. Sexy Alien."
59,59,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Tell them to pull their fingers out, Mark."
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,3,Maybe some music?
61,61,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Look, maybe I should go."
62,62,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah, I called him earlier, boiler's sorted."
63,63,1,Jeremy,False,9,"No, not Hans, his mate, his mate's a plumber."
64,64,1,Jeremy,False,10,"There we go, one for you and one for Ben."
65,65,1,Jeremy,False,7,"I'll have Ben's for him, shall I?"
66,66,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Here's to you, Ben."
67,67,1,Jeremy,False,22,"Wow, yeah, I mean, there's a time for everything, isn't there? You know, there's a time for golf, a time for stew."
68,68,1,Jeremy,True,4,"Come on, Guru Jez."
69,69,1,Jeremy,False,43,"I mean, it's the whole circle of life, isn't it? I mean, if you believe in reincarnation, imagine if he... went, at the exact same moment that my friend's baby was born. Ben's spirit, his essence, might live on, Bluetoothed into the baby."
70,70,1,Jeremy,False,17,We need to get you some answers. Is he going to pull through? You need to know.
71,71,1,Jeremy,True,24,"I need to know. Right now, I'm a supporting character in a weepy, when I want to be the leading man in a porno."
72,72,1,Jeremy,False,20,"This is difficult, but if he does make it through, will he still be... operating from below the waistal area?"
73,73,1,Jeremy,False,30,"Will he still be able to, communicate... with his... communication rod, or will he no longer be able to... lift the drawbridge, so to speak? I'm thinking about Zahra's needs."
74,74,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Thank you, doctor."
75,75,1,Jeremy,True,5,I'm twenty-four hours from Tulsa.
76,76,1,Jeremy,True,24,"Finally, I'm in pole position. Ben checks out, I check in. I mean, I definitely, definitely hope he doesn't, but if he does, then..."
77,77,1,Jeremy,False,1,Urgh!
78,78,1,Jeremy,False,1,Nothing.
79,79,1,Jeremy,True,22,"Don't tell her, don't raise her hopes. Could have been anything. Phantom toe syndrome, methane build-up, disturbance in the force. Oh, bollocks."
80,80,1,Jeremy,False,12,"Zahra, I think Ben's trying to tell you something, with his foot."
81,81,1,Jeremy,False,3,"That's brilliant, Zahra!"
82,82,1,Jeremy,True,16,"Fucking great, the mummy returns. Finally find the woman of my dreams, and her boyfriend reanimates."
83,83,1,Jeremy,False,1,Nice.
84,84,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Easy, buddy."
85,85,1,Jeremy,False,11,"I went to see Soph, why are you not in there?"
86,86,1,Jeremy,False,1,Really?
87,87,1,Jeremy,False,9,She didn't mention that. The midwife didn't mention that.
88,88,1,Jeremy,False,43,"Look, Mark, I get it, if this was happening to me, I'd be doing what you're doing a hundred times over. But you don't want to look back on today thinking when your baby was being born, you were taking out a ninja."
89,89,1,Jeremy,False,7,You need to get back in there.
90,90,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, my God, you're a dad."
91,91,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Wow. Listen, this probably doesn't matter right now, but Hans called."
92,92,1,Jeremy,False,17,"It's all sorted, new boilers up and running and there's minimal water damage. He sent a photo."
93,93,1,Jeremy,False,3,Minimal water damage.
94,94,2,Jeremy,True,84,"Wow, me and Hans in band. First jam the Man Feelings. The only thing is, why did I say I could play the sax? I can't play the sax. I bet I could manage a couple of toots, it's basically just a big metal kazoo. How come Denton got the bongos? It's not fair, anyone could bang shit. Give a chimpanzee a double espresso and you've got yourself a drummer. Gotta enter the jam. Well that was a disaster. But, can't back down now."
95,95,2,Jeremy,False,10,You can't stop someone from jamming. That's against jam law.
96,96,2,Jeremy,False,22,"OK I'm gonna stop jamming now, but only because my jam is complete and I wish to have a cup of tea."
97,97,2,Jeremy,True,14,"Yeah, take that. Little do they know, I'm actually probably gonna have a coffee."
98,98,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, no worries."
99,99,2,Jeremy,True,12,How can I steal your girlfriend? How can I steal your girlfriend?
100,100,2,Jeremy,False,1,Word.
101,101,2,Jeremy,True,18,"I liked you a lot more when you were unconscious, Ben. That was a great look for you."
102,102,2,Jeremy,True,17,"Threesome, probably. God, it's like being offered a tiramisu and a dead kitten on the same plate."
103,103,2,Jeremy,True,2,Massive twat.
104,104,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Yeah, well, I've always believed the internet is actually gonna be pretty big."
105,105,2,Jeremy,True,5,I don't want a job.
106,106,2,Jeremy,False,5,I would like a job.
107,107,2,Jeremy,False,6,I'd be... head of the label?
108,108,2,Jeremy,True,23,"This is brilliant! I could do the job, have an affair, juggle them both till it all blows up in my stupid face."
109,109,2,Jeremy,True,27,"Yes Shakira, I'm Jeremy and you're actually very much too poppy for my taste, but it you suck this, I might put you out on my label."
110,110,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Sorry to interrupt you playing, boys."
111,111,2,Jeremy,False,46,"I'm back so early because I have the coolest job in the world and Ben is the coolest boss in the world. I asked him when I should come in tomorrow, and he said, ""whenever you can make it"". His motto is ""The work never starts."""
112,112,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Who gives a shit? We don't make money, money makes us."
113,113,2,Jeremy,False,21,It means I'm gonna light up a fatty and crack open my brand new X-Box. Good luck with the regression session.
114,114,2,Jeremy,False,18,"I don't know, dude. I don't make the rules. Enjoy playing soldiers and wanking over Dobby on Facebook."
115,115,2,Jeremy,False,17,"So listen, you know since you, uh... invited me out of the band, I've got this job."
116,116,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, well eggs is eggs."
117,117,2,Jeremy,True,4,Is that a thing?
118,118,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Obviously I've got this er, development pot."
119,119,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Look, you're on my radar."
120,120,2,Jeremy,True,6,Ha ha. I'm the emperor now.
121,121,2,Jeremy,False,9,"But um, the look's not really working for me."
122,122,2,Jeremy,False,3,I was thinking...
123,123,2,Jeremy,True,4,what was I thinking?
124,124,2,Jeremy,False,2,Zoot suits.
125,125,2,Jeremy,False,12,"Definitely zoot suits, and um, also the name. I mean, ""Man Feelings""?"
126,126,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Hm, I was thinking something more distinctive."
127,127,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Like ""Danny Dyer's Chocolate Homunculus""."
128,128,2,Jeremy,False,9,It could be a deal-breaker. It certainly a game-changer.
129,129,2,Jeremy,True,4,I sound so important.
130,130,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Suit yourselves, boys. I've got other fish to fry, in my... frying pan."
131,131,2,Jeremy,True,29,"Sweet exit line. Now, to find the exit. I can't really see a thing with these on. Can I turn that into a little dance? Nope, play it cool."
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,30,"Yeah, there is one other thing. Your bongo guy. He sucks ass. You need a shit hop bongista and I think I know where to find one. You get me?"
133,133,2,Jeremy,False,1,Hiya.
134,134,2,Jeremy,False,12,Phone rang at seven. He wanted me to go into the office.
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Yeah well, apparently work never starts, but work never stops."
136,136,2,Jeremy,False,25,"He's got me by the Blackberries. Turning it off is a sackable offense. If I go to a funeral, I can switch it to vibrate."
137,137,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Plus, it turns out the website, you know it's really mainly about the merch."
138,138,2,Jeremy,False,49,"Merchandise. Ben says ""I'm all about the merch. Cut me and I bleed merch."" I can't believe I had him at my mercy in the hospital and I let him go. If I'd known he was such as arsehole, I'd have at least given his tube a little waggle."
139,139,2,Jeremy,False,74,"He wasn't even there. It was just me and the servers. After a while, I started to pretend that I was a robot. And, then, I sort of couldn't remember whether I was a robot or not, so I had to get out of there. Anyway, I nicked you some manilla envelopes. 'Cause I know you like to stockpile them and- ooh, Mark is that OK? By the shredder? Can babies go by shredders?"
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,1,Awww.
141,141,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Wow, 'cause you... you're pretty uptight. I mean, you hate people pissing on you."
142,142,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Great, that's nice."
143,143,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah all right, I get the picture."
144,144,2,Jeremy,False,2,Great. Tea?
145,145,2,Jeremy,True,16,Course he's happier with the kit. I bet he wishes the baby was a mortar round.
146,146,2,Jeremy,True,26,"Oh, no milk. Not black tea, I'm not some kind of monster. Hello, the human cow. Why not? Luxury milk, lady milk. Because you deserve it."
147,147,2,Jeremy,False,21,"If it's another alleged error on Nikita Khrushchev's Wikipedia page, then I can't say I'm getting very worked up about it."
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,1,So?
149,149,2,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
150,150,2,Jeremy,False,12,"You're no brown, Mark. Your hands are made of flesh and blood."
151,151,2,Jeremy,False,15,"No? I thought there was something wrong with his arm, or his ear, wasn't there?"
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Uh, no we do."
153,153,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Mark, relax."
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,10,Think of it as lady milk. From the human cow.
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,29,"Oh right so it's weird to drink milk from someone you know but, to drink milk from another species, some cow that you've never met, that's fine is it?"
156,156,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, suit yourself. Mmmmm, luxury milk."
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,38,"Sweet. Just texted Ben. Said I had to go to a funeral. Plus, I've got the squits and you're locked in the bathroom having a breakdown. I threw a lot of shit at the wall, see what sticks."
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,3,What a shit.
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,6,Yeah but he didn't know that.
160,160,2,Jeremy,False,11,You taught him the palm? But I told you the palm!
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Shit, Ben."
162,162,2,Jeremy,False,12,"Ben Ten! The Bento box. Yes, I am still at the funeral."
163,163,2,Jeremy,False,4,...that's the whole story.
164,164,2,Jeremy,False,25,"Baby? Uh, yeah, that's just the baby, obviously, at the funeral with me. Don't worry little one, she's in Heaven. Your mummy's in Heaven now."
165,165,2,Jeremy,True,12,"The baby doesn't have a clue what I'm one about, it's fine."
166,166,2,Jeremy,False,56,"Yeah, yeah I'm hoping people might affectionately call them ""The Homunculi"". I'm gonna sign them tomorrow night after the gig. No, no need for you to come, dude. No, just check out the web page. But ignore all the shitty comments. They're all made by the same thirty to forty people so they don't really count."
167,167,2,Jeremy,False,7,And you're sure these are zoot suits?
168,168,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah, I mean, I love them, obviously. It's just um, I thought there'd be more..."
169,169,2,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah, great, I love them. So I got the uh, contract. You still wanna do the punk thing?"
170,170,2,Jeremy,False,9,Zahra! You came! In time to see me play.
171,171,2,Jeremy,False,9,Sure I told you I was in a band.
172,172,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Well I'm a musician, so I guess you must love me!"
173,173,2,Jeremy,True,15,Is that a joke? Or just a genuine wish with me laughing at the end?
174,174,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Great, Mr. Ben. The Homunculi welcome you."
175,175,2,Jeremy,False,29,"So uh, I just wanted to flag out with you about the band. I'm going to taking on a much more hands-on role than your traditional exec. In fact..."
176,176,2,Jeremy,False,1,What?
177,177,2,Jeremy,False,8,Is it a chick born with a dick?
178,178,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, goths?"
179,179,2,Jeremy,True,19,"Oh fucking great, I've got to fire myself, I wonder how I'll take it. Very badly I should imagine."
180,180,2,Jeremy,False,6,"OK guys, so here's the thing."
181,181,2,Jeremy,False,50,"Yeah, look, I've been thinking with my thinking cap, and basically yeah, we're a great band and obviously I could sign us, of course I could. Um, I could sign us a thousand times over, but are we hungry enough? I mean sure, were hungry, but are we ravenous? Because-"
182,182,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Firing them now, Ben."
183,183,2,Jeremy,False,43,"No, you're fired. I mean all of us were fired. But were all in this together against the fucking suits. Who are me, so, fuck me! Why don't we show me what I'm missing and do the best gig of our lives. Yeah?!"
184,184,2,Jeremy,True,50,"Right, suited and booted, yeah I'm just another band member running late because there was one last line of coke that needed snorting. Just uh, slide this up on here. Yeah, that right honey. One foot in the band. I'm re-joining you by the power of standing right by you."
185,185,3,Jeremy,False,7,Wow. That's what I thought. Wowsers trousers.
186,186,3,Jeremy,False,27,"No way, no. I loved every minute of it. The colours, the woman, the... it was all great. Amélie is a fantastic film. What a fantastic film."
187,187,3,Jeremy,False,1,Exactly.
188,188,3,Jeremy,False,17,"That shit, trying to lure you in by entertaining you. It's so shallow. Are you cabbing it?"
189,189,3,Jeremy,True,6,Won't tell her I'm bussing it.
190,190,3,Jeremy,False,24,"It's great isn't it how, even though I'm an attractive guy and you're an attractive girl, we can just hang out like great mates."
191,191,3,Jeremy,True,2,The shit.
192,192,3,Jeremy,False,22,"I adore, enormously, all of that. And you run that book group, don't you? Which is great because I love difficult literature."
193,193,3,Jeremy,False,2,Does Ben...
194,194,3,Jeremy,True,2,the shit
195,195,3,Jeremy,False,1,go?
196,196,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, he is missing out on so much."
197,197,3,Jeremy,False,22,"I mean so many people just plod through life, you know, thinking the same stupid thoughts with their tiny, predictable, identikit minds."
198,198,3,Jeremy,False,2,I agree.
199,199,3,Jeremy,False,2,Bye then.
200,200,3,Jeremy,False,1,Indeedy.
201,201,3,Jeremy,True,6,This is all so fucking sophisticated.
202,202,3,Jeremy,False,4,"No, you da man."
203,203,3,Jeremy,True,4,Why is that funny?
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,15,"And you're off it all? Crack as well? But you love crack, it's your favourite!"
205,205,3,Jeremy,False,5,So how's all this going?
206,206,3,Jeremy,False,2,Like what?
207,207,3,Jeremy,False,1,Great.
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,7,"He is a bit mad, isn't he?"
209,209,3,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
210,210,3,Jeremy,False,10,"No, no, I mean yeah, I'm not really listening, sorry."
211,211,3,Jeremy,False,1,What?
212,212,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Oh my God, you're asking me for sex tips. Pass me the Cava and the big pack of Tyrell's, it's a girls night in!"
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,2,Unleashes hell?
214,214,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Well, it depends Mark. It often depends on, you know, where you are, if you get me."
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,27,"You've got to know about the bum, Mark, otherwise it's like only cooking with the hob and never using the oven. The bum is the secret portal."
216,216,3,Jeremy,False,8,So you think you've lost your dirty mojo?
217,217,3,Jeremy,False,1,What?
218,218,3,Jeremy,False,3,"A what, Mark?"
219,219,3,Jeremy,False,1,Blimey.
220,220,3,Jeremy,False,4,How big is it?
221,221,3,Jeremy,False,1,Kenneth?
222,222,3,Jeremy,False,5,And has Kenneth... seen action?
223,223,3,Jeremy,False,5,So is your work still...
224,224,3,Jeremy,True,10,"good, bad, does he like it there now? I've forgotten."
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,2,You know.
226,226,3,Jeremy,False,35,"Yeah, sorry man, my bad. You should tell her you need time off. I mean, I'm no NHS Direct, but this stress can't be doing your sex life any good. Tell Gail she's exploiting you."
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Christ, Mark, you really need to grow a pair."
228,228,3,Jeremy,False,1,Yes.
229,229,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Look, Gail's fucking you over because you're so bloody passive. You need to rip her a new one."
230,230,3,Jeremy,True,25,Never fancied a girl with glasses before. I wouldn't care if she had a limp or a funny elbow. I'm so PC. I'm horny Gandhi.
231,231,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, nice movie. The colours, the woman in it."
232,232,3,Jeremy,False,1,Arrangement?
233,233,3,Jeremy,False,1,Amélie.
234,234,3,Jeremy,True,2,You shit.
235,235,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, shall I order that toner from the Viking Catalogue or...?"
236,236,3,Jeremy,False,3,"Not ordinarily, no."
237,237,3,Jeremy,False,1,No.
238,238,3,Jeremy,False,16,"I really don't, she's just normal. You know, like trifle or, er, the pavement. Just... there."
239,239,3,Jeremy,False,1,Brilliant.
240,240,3,Jeremy,True,8,"Stop making my lovely job lovelier, you shit."
241,241,3,Jeremy,False,34,"Yeah. Yeah, you know, I honestly never thought I could enjoy working because obviously, when you work you can't go back to bed until night time, which seems mad, but, I really like it."
242,242,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Yeah, sure. I mean I was gonna go myself anyway on Sunday, but yeah, let's go together."
243,243,3,Jeremy,True,29,"Jesus Christ I am so out of my depth. Who's Richard Avedon? What's a symposium? At least I know which day Friday is, that's something to cling on to."
244,244,3,Jeremy,False,3,No she won't.
245,245,3,Jeremy,False,16,"I'd say that was more sympathy or empathy. One of the pathies, the pathies are nice."
246,246,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Don't worry! Zahra says ""we have only one thing to fear and that's fear itself"". It's a clever saying, isn't it?"
247,247,3,Jeremy,False,7,"It's a clever saying, though, isn't it?"
248,248,3,Jeremy,False,10,"No, I'm not! I'm playing with the opposite of fire."
249,249,3,Jeremy,False,42,"Exactly, thank you. Because yeah, obviously I fancy Zahra, but I want to keep my nice job so I've decided to just be in love with her mind. A pure, modest, beautiful love. And then possibly have a wank when we're Skyping."
250,250,3,Jeremy,False,1,Hans.
251,251,3,Jeremy,False,2,What's happening?
252,252,3,Jeremy,False,1,What?
253,253,3,Jeremy,False,9,But that's like in Scotland or something isn't it?
254,254,3,Jeremy,False,26,"OK, well find some polythene or something to pull over yourself and a bit of waste ground and I'm sure you'll feel fine in the morning."
255,255,3,Jeremy,True,30,"God, I fancy you. Should I make a move? I'll lose my job. I like my job. Why can't I have everything I want all the time? Isn't that democracy?"
256,256,3,Jeremy,False,2,Love it.
257,257,3,Jeremy,False,1,Mmm.
258,258,3,Jeremy,True,3,"OK, here goes."
259,259,3,Jeremy,False,8,I've been reading a very brilliant novel lately.
260,260,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Yeah, it's about a man and a woman. It's not set here, it's set out in... Iran."
261,261,3,Jeremy,False,47,"And the woman, she's with someone else who is the man's... um, not boss, but his... baseball coach. Yeah, and he really wants to stay in the baseball team, the man, but he also really wants to get together with the attractive woman. It's a great book."
262,262,3,Jeremy,False,2,Baseball Man.
263,263,3,Jeremy,False,17,Well you could have your book group at my place and I could fill in for Paul.
264,264,3,Jeremy,False,2,No worries.
265,265,3,Jeremy,True,8,Hope its Mr. Nice. I've read Mr. Nice.
266,266,3,Jeremy,True,11,"Right, doesn't sound like another Howard Marks book, but fingers crossed."
267,267,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Ah, brilliant."
268,268,3,Jeremy,True,8,Fuck hard right here and then kill Ben?
269,269,3,Jeremy,False,1,Super!
270,270,3,Jeremy,False,10,Yes it's a book. Why shouldn't it be a book?
271,271,3,Jeremy,False,6,"I'm going to read it, Mark."
272,272,3,Jeremy,False,92,"No, I don't! I love reading. I read Mr. Nice four times. I read The Bunny Suicides. Look, I've offered to host Zahra's book group, OK? And now shitty Ben's decided he's coming because it's happening here and he's all jealous and suspicious. So what I thought was, even though I can't tell Ben to fuck off, I can defeat him mentally at the book group and impress Zahra by saying clever things. So I'm going to read all of this book from page one to... oh shit, three hundred and seventy-two?!"
273,273,3,Jeremy,False,40,"I look at it, I read the words, or think I do, but then I get distracted or I don't quite take it in and I have to go back. I've been on the same four pages for three hours."
274,274,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Mark, how do you read? Can you teach me to read?"
275,275,3,Jeremy,False,13,"Yes. I mean not literally but, how do you concentrate? Please tell me."
276,276,3,Jeremy,True,13,"Oh, ""turn the telly off"". Everything bad starts with ""turn the telly off""."
277,277,3,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
278,278,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Yes, yes, I do."
279,279,3,Jeremy,False,29,Oh it's too difficult! I mean the story's told by a man and then a lady and then no one. Why can't we read something simple like Mr. Nice?
280,280,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Right, I'm gonna sit outside on the balcony all night and finish this book. That way I'll be cold and I won't fall asleep."
281,281,3,Jeremy,False,15,I can't do it Mark. It's three hundred and seventy-two pages long and I'm freezing.
282,282,3,Jeremy,False,18,"So what I was thinking was, could you read it for me? The stupid olden days book. Please?"
283,283,3,Jeremy,False,22,Please. I'll do the washing up every day until I die and then my children will do the washing up after that.
284,284,3,Jeremy,False,14,Are we doing a deal? A grubby deal like oil men or corrupt councillors?
285,285,3,Jeremy,False,3,You massive prostitute!
286,286,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Um, they're ready Mark."
287,287,3,Jeremy,False,15,"No, Mark, we made a deal. Remember? A grubby deal? You've got to defeat Ben!"
288,288,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Mark, I need you. I haven't read the book."
289,289,3,Jeremy,True,9,"We're letting you castrate yourself, as it's your penknife."
290,290,3,Jeremy,True,25,Great. What do I say? I'm pretty sure it's a love story. Can I compare it to another love story? The film Love Story maybe?
291,291,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Well, as a love story-"
292,292,3,Jeremy,False,3,A love story?
293,293,3,Jeremy,True,3,I hate you.
294,294,3,Jeremy,True,9,Fuck you! Mark's going in to bat for me.
295,295,3,Jeremy,True,13,"And he's really good at this, unlike any game actually involving a bat."
296,296,3,Jeremy,False,2,Thanks mate.
297,297,3,Jeremy,False,10,OK. Do you think Kenneth might have been made redundant?
298,298,3,Jeremy,False,8,Kenneth is what Mark calls his nine-inch dildo.
299,299,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Chill, brother. Where are you?"
300,300,4,Jeremy,False,16,What are you doing in a phone box? Have you put a farthing in the slot?
301,301,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Hey, Mark's in a phone box!"
302,302,4,Jeremy,False,5,Are you doing it ironically?
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,24,"You've what? Oh, my God, this is massive! What are you gonna do next, move into a hut and start drinking your own piss?"
304,304,4,Jeremy,False,40,"Yeah, right. What if I need to contact you? What if I take a mega trip and forget who I am? What if we run out of Marmite and you're at the corner shop? These are all real-life nightmare scenarios."
305,305,4,Jeremy,False,1,Zahra's.
306,306,4,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, we were doing some work for Ben, and it got late and I stayed over, God!"
307,307,4,Jeremy,True,12,Free cab ride to the christening. Another win for the lazy man.
308,308,4,Jeremy,False,7,"OK, let's brew this thing! Oh, fuck!"
309,309,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Could be, like, fifteen minutes, could be, like, eighteen hours. I normally just bang it in and leave it for a couple of days."
310,310,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Well, fine, but I can't just take them out, can I? It's so frustrating. I can see them, but I can't get to them."
311,311,4,Jeremy,True,4,"Oh, great, Tesco trousers."
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Ben's! I can get them back by tonight, he'll never know the difference."
313,313,4,Jeremy,False,34,"Has it never occurred to you that two human beings of the opposite gender could have a simple human relationship without sex being involved? You think you know me so well, but you don't."
314,314,4,Jeremy,False,33,"I'm not just some filthy sex beast, you know. I am capable of higher thought. I do have feelings, ambitions, dreams. I thought of that hat that could keep beer cool if you-"
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,4,Just turn the knob.
316,316,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Well, turn it properly."
317,317,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Well, obviously not, otherwise the door would be open."
318,318,4,Jeremy,False,5,Let me try. Mr Patheto-hand.
319,319,4,Jeremy,True,1,Oh.
320,320,4,Jeremy,False,4,It can't be locked.
321,321,4,Jeremy,True,1,Uh-oh.
322,322,4,Jeremy,False,3,Someone's double-locked it?
323,323,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Don't sweat it dude, I'll call Zahra."
324,324,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, answerphone."
325,325,4,Jeremy,False,32,"Er, hi, Zahra, Jez here. Yeah, erm, we're locked in your building, so if you could come back and release us from the cage, that'd be much appreciated, thanks a lot, bye-bye."
326,326,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Relax, I'll credit-card the lock."
327,327,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Oh, fuck, this is impossible. It's really irresponsible of films to make out that this is an option at all, because it just isn't."
328,328,4,Jeremy,False,27,"No, my battery, I've only got, like a milli-bit of power bar left. I suppose a phone of your own might be quite useful right now, yeah?"
329,329,4,Jeremy,False,18,"I suppose we do need to get out of here quite soon, before the air supply runs out."
330,330,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Well, in here, the air supply's gonna run out sooner or later. What? I'm not an idiot. Why does that make me an idiot?"
331,331,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Just one, I'm not having you being profligate with my bar."
332,332,4,Jeremy,False,2,That's two!
333,333,4,Jeremy,False,2,King's Drive.
334,334,4,Jeremy,False,5,"fifty-two, ooh, fifty-four. Er... fifty-"
335,335,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Is it a forty? forty-something? It's a forty,... forty..."
336,336,4,Jeremy,False,4,Forty-two! Forty-two King's Drive!
337,337,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Prong? OK, Mark, give me the phone."
338,338,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Mark, I know this phone. It's not one of these fakers that can run forever on one red millimetre. This phone doesn't fuck around."
339,339,4,Jeremy,False,1,Pizza.
340,340,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Yes, I will hold."
341,341,4,Jeremy,False,17,"I'm hungry, Mark! I didn't have any breakfast! Or would you have us both starve to death?"
342,342,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Yes, I'd like a large feast please..."
343,343,4,Jeremy,False,8,Are you posting yourself out piece by piece?
344,344,4,Jeremy,False,21,"Uh-huh. Maybe you'll attract a naval captain, who'll come and rescue us in his frigate. Ooh, I tell you what, though."
345,345,4,Jeremy,False,18,"I really need a wee. Maybe, in a corner? Or we could make an area that became... disgusting?"
346,346,4,Jeremy,False,10,"What, you mean flop the hose out of the slot?"
347,347,4,Jeremy,False,60,"Oh, right, and what if a passer-by decides to try and turn off the nozzle? Hmm? What if a squirrel wants a sausage? I'm not just sending my member out into the world solo to seek his fortune. I look after him and he looks after me. That's the contract. The letter box is not a glory hole for urine."
348,348,4,Jeremy,False,23,"Are you serious? You're going to kick the door, using one of your legs, with enough force it's going to be smashed open?"
349,349,4,Jeremy,False,61,"Mark Corrigan is going to kick down a door? Oh, this is too good. Don't start yet. Just let me get settled. OK. And go, go, Gadget Leg! Mm, mm, good. Good first kick. Of course, you are going to have to smash it out of the frame, so only about another million more kicks like that and we'll be out."
350,350,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, right, yeah, wrong shoes! Yeah, sure, bummer."
351,351,4,Jeremy,False,32,"Look, dude, Zahra's gonna call back. But, you know, until she does, we're in the Nether Zone, yeah? Time moves at a different speed in the Nether Zone. We need to relax."
352,352,4,Jeremy,False,1,Why?
353,353,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Dude, we're here for the duration. Let's chill out."
354,354,4,Jeremy,False,6,Let's get to know each other.
355,355,4,Jeremy,False,19,"OK, um. Oh, oh! OK, if you had to, if you had to, would you have sex with me?"
356,356,4,Jeremy,False,15,"If you had to. If the men came and they made us, with their guns."
357,357,4,Jeremy,False,1,What?
358,358,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Hang on. You're saying you could rape me, but you couldn't make love to me. That is so you, that is you all over."
359,359,4,Jeremy,False,23,"OK, here's a history one. What would you have done in France in the war? Would you have joined the Resistance or not?"
360,360,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Ah, but you want to, though, don't you? I've tickled your historical G-spot."
361,361,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Nah, that's fine, totally fine. Why don't you just jump out of the window?"
362,362,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Mark, we're not in Road Runner."
363,363,4,Jeremy,False,2,Baby Ian.
364,364,4,Jeremy,False,11,Ian Chapman. You'd have a baby that sounded like a solicitor.
365,365,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Well, I mean, I could make it, but..."
366,366,4,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, if I needed to. I'd just jump over the trellis, bounce off the wall, hit the ground, parachute roll, basic moves."
367,367,4,Jeremy,False,1,Nah.
368,368,4,Jeremy,False,4,Not in the mood.
369,369,4,Jeremy,True,3,"Oh, that's better."
370,370,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Yes, I'm actually doing it."
371,371,4,Jeremy,False,21,"Mark, it's a perfectly friendly piss. I'm not- Oh, shit! Withdraw all units. If it's the cops, don't open the door."
372,372,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Pizza! Nutritious, delicious pizza!"
373,373,4,Jeremy,False,4,I've thought about that.
374,374,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Just slide that baby through the letterbox, dude."
375,375,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Piece by piece, dude. Piece by piece."
376,376,4,Jeremy,False,3,Keep the change.
377,377,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh, shit, no, the brush! Dude, dude, we're getting fucked with the brush!"
378,378,4,Jeremy,False,4,Do you want some?
379,379,4,Jeremy,False,7,What happens if you eat letter-box hair?
380,380,4,Jeremy,False,9,Does post even need brushing? Who wants brushed post?
381,381,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Hang on, dude, I've got it. I've got a sheath. Use this as a protective covering."
382,382,4,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's working. We've cracked it! We should sell these. Periodical pizza shields. We could take these to the Dragons!"
383,383,4,Jeremy,False,28,"Hello? Oh, hi, Ben. Er... where am I? I'm at home right now. I mean I've got to go to this christening first, so I'll be on vibrate..."
384,384,4,Jeremy,False,13,"OK, you're popping over to Zahra's? I mean, do you need to, dude?"
385,385,4,Jeremy,False,1,Great.
386,386,4,Jeremy,False,21,"Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit! Ben's coming here! He's got a key, he's gonna pick up his laptop. Oh, fingerbobs!"
387,387,4,Jeremy,False,6,"No, it's not. Everything's triple-fried fucked!"
388,388,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Because I did sleep with Zahra last night, OK? If you really want to know."
389,389,4,Jeremy,False,17,"I don't know. I was just on a roll, enjoying being self-righteous. Besides, we very nearly didn't."
390,390,4,Jeremy,False,34,"But then we totally did. I mean, if it makes you feel any better, the sex was terrible. We didn't connect. She's LEGO, I'm a Stickle Brick. Plus she's very orally focused, whereas I'm-"
391,391,4,Jeremy,False,26,"Oh, shit. Oh, this is bad, this is really, really bad. I'm gonna lose the best job I've ever had. Oh, what am I gonna do?"
392,392,4,Jeremy,False,22,"Oh, that's nice. Kick the dirty dog while he's down. The dirty, filthy dog deserves another quick boot in his tender nuts."
393,393,4,Jeremy,False,7,We've got to get out of here!
394,394,4,Jeremy,True,1,Ooh.
395,395,4,Jeremy,False,12,Oh. Is this the same window? 'Cause it looks much higher up.
396,396,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, I can't do it."
397,397,4,Jeremy,False,10,Ben's gonna be here any minute. I've got to hide.
398,398,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Hey, Dr Sarcasmo, I've found something, look."
399,399,4,Jeremy,False,6,But we can utilize this area.
400,400,4,Jeremy,False,16,"It could be great for sleeping, this could be where we sleep, or do our business."
401,401,4,Jeremy,False,10,I could hide in the area when Ben comes. Perfect!
402,402,4,Jeremy,False,3,"Hey, look, Mark."
403,403,4,Jeremy,False,17,"A thing, a bit. This is our ticket out of here. We can do anything with this!"
404,404,4,Jeremy,False,40,"We could smash a window, or break a lock, or hit a man over the head with it. It's like ""Whose Line Is it Anyway?"" for criminals. We could sit on it for entertainment, or I could wedge it in."
405,405,4,Jeremy,True,9,"Come on, bit, don't let me down now, bit."
406,406,4,Jeremy,False,3,Zahra's spare? Ahhh!
407,407,4,Jeremy,False,22,"Food, water! Hey, I wonder if she's the sort of dirty sausage that keep a little skin flick at the back here."
408,408,4,Jeremy,False,6,"You can do it, Rain Man."
409,409,4,Jeremy,False,6,Try again. Try all the variations.
410,410,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah, there can only be a few variations."
411,411,4,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
412,412,4,Jeremy,False,5,I'm only trying to help.
413,413,4,Jeremy,False,1,Hide!
414,414,4,Jeremy,False,4,We've got to hide!
415,415,4,Jeremy,False,6,We should be safe in here.
416,416,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Sure, go on, then."
417,417,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Look, once he's had ""brunchicus"", he'll piss off and we can make a break for it."
418,418,4,Jeremy,False,20,"I don't know! Look since we're stuck in here, you might as well answer my question about the French Resistance."
419,419,4,Jeremy,False,8,You're kidding! I totally would have joined up.
420,420,4,Jeremy,False,19,"I'd probably have just got in a train to Berlin and taken Hitler down. Boof, the whole thing's over."
421,421,4,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, I know, I definitely know. No question about it."
422,422,4,Jeremy,False,16,I can't believe you wouldn't be in the Resistance with me. I'm really disappointed in you.
423,423,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Don't apologize to me, apologise to... Europe."
424,424,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, shit, he's coming!"
425,425,4,Jeremy,False,1,Or...
426,426,4,Jeremy,False,5,"I know, I know man."
427,427,4,Jeremy,False,23,"No, Mark. If you go out there, you'll destroy me. You'll destroy my career. Either that or destroy my relationship with my son."
428,428,4,Jeremy,False,47,"Bollocks. He's how old, one month? All he knows is that it's bath time in the biggest, weirdest bath in the world. All right, if you've got to go, can you at least do something like run out with the radio? Then he'll think you're a burglar."
429,429,4,Jeremy,False,8,He won't stab you. You're so overly dramatic.
430,430,4,Jeremy,True,15,"Here she comes. If she washes, I stay put, toilet action and I'm coming out."
431,431,4,Jeremy,False,1,Hello.
432,432,4,Jeremy,False,7,We got locked in the Nether Zone.
433,433,4,Jeremy,False,13,"And then we got back in, and then Ben came, so we hid."
434,434,4,Jeremy,False,1,No.
435,435,4,Jeremy,False,8,We don't know. Didn't you get my message?
436,436,4,Jeremy,False,15,"No, Zahra, it's not some weird thing. We're not touching ourselves, or touching each other."
437,437,4,Jeremy,False,31,"I know, and I guess this might be a good time to, as we discussed, break up with him. I mean, he might leave, all crying, and, you know, everyone's cushty."
438,438,4,Jeremy,False,6,You mean us dancing on ice?
439,439,4,Jeremy,False,34,"Is this about last night? 'Cause I can do better, I know I can. I didn't even, go down on you, which is a great shame, because I love to go down on women..."
440,440,4,Jeremy,False,3,"don't I, Mark?"
441,441,4,Jeremy,False,20,"One little blip? Why do I keep getting dumped? I mean, what's wrong with me? Am I a bad person?"
442,442,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Look, I should, er, explain. Um, sometimes we come here, me and Mark. Zahra lets us use this place."
443,443,4,Jeremy,False,14,"To meet. Um, it's just a good place for us to... meet at lunchtime."
444,444,4,Jeremy,False,2,It's complicated.
445,445,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Well, often we'll just have a glass of wine and a chat. But yes, sometimes Mark and I will jump in the shower together."
446,446,4,Jeremy,False,2,Why here?
447,447,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, Mark, you explain."
448,448,4,Jeremy,False,8,"We used to go to the Travelodge, but-"
449,449,4,Jeremy,False,25,"Look, the truth is that sometimes we like to pretend that one of us is you so that the other one gets to fuck him."
450,450,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Hey, you don't know all the kinds of gay guys. We're not all clones from the clone zone."
451,451,4,Jeremy,True,7,"God, I'd be a great gay guy!"
452,452,4,Jeremy,False,10,"You did it, man! Did you do a parachute roll?"
453,453,4,Jeremy,False,3,You da man!
454,454,4,Jeremy,True,11,"My God, he did it! What an incredibly brave dick pipe."
455,455,4,Jeremy,False,10,At least we made it in time for the party.
456,456,4,Jeremy,False,13,"He didn't actually say I was sacked. I mean, he didn't say it."
457,457,4,Jeremy,False,6,I actually think I aced it.
458,458,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh, that's good. Hate for him to go to hell 'cause of silly old me."
459,459,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Hello, happy Christmas. Can I come in yet, Mark?"
460,460,5,Jeremy,False,13,There wasn't anything at the end of my bed when I woke up.
461,461,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, brilliant, and you saw?"
462,462,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Shit, sorry dude. Ooh, slim but promising, Mark, slim but promising."
463,463,5,Jeremy,False,9,"We're going to open 'em in bed, aren't we?"
464,464,5,Jeremy,False,15,"If our feet touch, we fuck, obviously. Come on, dive in, let the festivities begin."
465,465,5,Jeremy,False,14,"I know. Ooh, smells interesting. It looks like firelighters, but what is it? Firelighters."
466,466,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, right."
467,467,5,Jeremy,False,6,I heard you talking about it.
468,468,5,Jeremy,False,3,What are these?
469,469,5,Jeremy,False,25,"You bought yourself some kitchen tongs? Oh, and yes, I remember you getting this ScotRail sleeping mask when you went on ScotRail overnight to Aberdeen."
470,470,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Right, in mine, we sort of try quite hard."
471,471,5,Jeremy,True,8,He's trying to strangle my Christmas with Sellotape.
472,472,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Sorry, it's just this is my first Christmas without Mum 'cause-"
473,473,5,Jeremy,False,25,"Mm-hmm, quite a specimen. I thought about trimming the top off, but it felt like I was castrating Christmas. You know, chopping Santa's bollocks off."
474,474,5,Jeremy,False,19,"I'm fine, it's just, even though I'm looking at the tree, I'm just not, I'm not getting it yet."
475,475,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Christmas-y, Mark, I'm not getting the Christmas-y feeling. Let's crank up Classic FM, let's get our Christmas on!"
476,476,5,Jeremy,False,8,Nice to have your family here for Christmas.
477,477,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Christmas is coming home, ding-dong merrily on Mark."
478,478,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah right, lunch is at three. You do presents first, and then-"
479,479,5,Jeremy,False,6,"But, that's not my Christmas, because-"
480,480,5,Jeremy,True,15,"Don't let him spoil it, don't let him rile me, not today, not on Christmas."
481,481,5,Jeremy,False,1,What?
482,482,5,Jeremy,False,7,I thought you were getting the turkey.
483,483,5,Jeremy,False,13,"It was a joke, Mark, I was joking. It was a Christmas joke."
484,484,5,Jeremy,False,21,"Of course I've got a turkey, it's an organic turkey, I took ages researching it online, it's going to be delicious."
485,485,5,Jeremy,False,4,That wasn't very Christmas-y.
486,486,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, of course!"
487,487,5,Jeremy,True,11,"Don't think I'll be bothering with that, happy Christmas to me."
488,488,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Right, lovely, the more the merrier."
489,489,5,Jeremy,False,6,"No idea, dude, not my area."
490,490,5,Jeremy,False,3,Potatoes aren't veg.
491,491,5,Jeremy,False,13,"What-? Mmm... are they? I mean, they kind of are, but not really."
492,492,5,Jeremy,False,38,"Are you sure potatoes aren't veg? Aren't they... not earth but like, salt. I mean, tomatoes are fruit, and potatoes are... bread? No, I mean they're wheat-y, they don't go in the drawer in the fridge, so... yeah?"
493,493,5,Jeremy,False,25,"Well, now you're going on about it, maybe you're right, but you know, they're not exactly cabbage, are they? I mean, they're brown, they're nice!"
494,494,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Look, there must be potatoes, there's always potatoes."
495,495,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Two? Oh, that's not enough, I love potatoes, they're the best bit."
496,496,5,Jeremy,False,40,"That's mad, Mum, Christmas in Malta, thirty degrees? Have you had your turkey yet? What do you mean you're not having turkey? Well you can make it on the boat if you- Oh, OK, yeah, all right, bye, happy Christmas."
497,497,5,Jeremy,False,21,"They're having Salad Niçoise for Christmas. Salad Niçoise, that's not turkey, that's not even chicken. I'm gonna have a massive drink!"
498,498,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Maybe we should have Salad Niçoise, why the fuck not? I mean, who even cares?"
499,499,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Happy Christmas, Corrigans."
500,500,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Hello Sarah, happy Christmas."
501,501,5,Jeremy,True,16,"Oh, not Sarah, not again. Ding dong merrily on my dong, the Christmas elves are weeping."
502,502,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Long time no see, Mrs. C., how are you doing? What you been up to?"
503,503,5,Jeremy,False,18,"We can't do the crackers until we sit at the table! Crackers once you sit, that's the rule."
504,504,5,Jeremy,False,10,"I'm fine, it's just I'm tryin' to feel Christmas-y, and-"
505,505,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, Jezzed?"
506,506,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, right. So, uh, it's when you-"
507,507,5,Jeremy,False,33,"Right, yeah, yeah that is funny. Sort of a bit like being famous. I'll go see who that is, let's hope I don't Jez it, or do a big Mark in my pants."
508,508,5,Jeremy,False,1,Hans!
509,509,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Ah, happy Christmas!"
510,510,5,Jeremy,False,4,I'm not going to.
511,511,5,Jeremy,False,1,What?
512,512,5,Jeremy,False,9,"It's not my fault, I was holding the line."
513,513,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Well, I'm sorry, but I do know him."
514,514,5,Jeremy,False,12,"I don't wanna talk about it, OK Mark? Christmas is not ruined."
515,515,5,Jeremy,False,12,A great deal of it is cooked. Huge areas are cooked through.
516,516,5,Jeremy,False,1,Emmanuel.
517,517,5,Jeremy,False,2,Excuse me?
518,518,5,Jeremy,True,11,"Oh great, fucking thanks, Dan! Thus no, spake no, Zahrathustra nope!"
519,519,5,Jeremy,False,1,Correct!
520,520,5,Jeremy,True,3,Fuck you Dan!
521,521,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh I'm sorry, I thought you said ""Chicken Run""."
522,522,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Happy Christmas, one and all!"
523,523,5,Jeremy,False,29,"No, just carve off the bits that are definitely cooked, and leave the rest. That's what carving's for, isn't it? And then we'll put the carcass under the grill."
524,524,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah, sorry about that, Pam, here you go."
525,525,5,Jeremy,True,29,"Oh God, foot in the crotch, this isn't very Nat King Cole, but of course, I'm getting a hard-on anyway, like the horny Christmas elf I am, how pathetic."
526,526,5,Jeremy,False,1,Yes.
527,527,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Well, they're definitely there."
528,528,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Thank you, Pam!"
529,529,5,Jeremy,True,5,"Two-for-one, nice work Uncle Scrooge."
530,530,5,Jeremy,True,10,"He shoots, he scores, he calls his teammate a freak."
531,531,5,Jeremy,False,4,"But Sarah, it's Christmas."
532,532,5,Jeremy,False,16,"Of course I don't believe in Jesus, but I do believe in Christmas, I'm a Christmas-ist."
533,533,5,Jeremy,True,13,"Wow, I did it, I resisted something for something else. That was... something."
534,534,5,Jeremy,False,14,"Hey Mark, guess what, I was just offered sex and I turned it down."
535,535,5,Jeremy,False,6,I did it for Father Christmas.
536,536,6,Jeremy,False,38,"Ah, don't stress it man. We're gonna have new years dude, Darty style. Remember that time we were coming back from Cinderella's and Pej put his pants on the taxi driver's head and he couldn't see a thing?"
537,537,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, come on man. Shake your booty. Tonight, even Paxman's out, hoovering up lines of crank off Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Tonight's the big one!"
538,538,6,Jeremy,False,21,"OK, we'll go to Johnson's as a stomach liner, a seat warmer. But then I'm taking you on a punani hunt!"
539,539,6,Jeremy,False,18,"Come on man. Dobby's gone. Zahra's gone. Tonight it's not about the bitches, it's all about the Hitches."
540,540,6,Jeremy,False,1,Zahra?
541,541,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
542,542,6,Jeremy,True,31,"That's the kind of bullshit I come up with. Is she doing a me? She still likes me! Or does she? I need evidence. I need confirmation, quick. OK, here goes."
543,543,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Sorry, that was probably totally inappropriate. It's just, you know, sometimes ""the scent of a woman""."
544,544,6,Jeremy,True,1,God.
545,545,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Who would have sex with Ben?! Apart from you, obviously."
546,546,6,Jeremy,False,1,Jesus!
547,547,6,Jeremy,False,6,Half a tub of cookie dough.
548,548,6,Jeremy,True,7,I will never know what that means.
549,549,6,Jeremy,False,3,"OK, wow, um..."
550,550,6,Jeremy,True,10,Don't say yes too quick. Don't say yes too quick.
551,551,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yes!
552,552,6,Jeremy,False,34,"Sure. I mean, Ben will definitely fire me, but I'll just get another job. I could easily start my own music merchandise website. I mean, I'm gonna get a laptop, so, er, yeah, sorted."
553,553,6,Jeremy,True,30,I'm moving in! I'm going to be the boyfriend who pays rent! I'm her rent boy but not sucking cock in a phone box. Eating pussy on a tumble dryer!
554,554,6,Jeremy,False,53,"So, er, listen, dude, listen. You know how women, when they live together, their periodicals start arriving at the same time, and how dogs come to look like their owners? Well, I really wouldn't want that to happen to us, so it actually... it actually looks like I'm going to be moving out."
555,555,6,Jeremy,False,15,No. Zahra's split up with Ben and she's asked me to move in with her.
556,556,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Dude, man, it's no biggie, you and me. It was a phase. Bada bing, bada bye."
557,557,6,Jeremy,False,28,"All things pass, you know? We're born, we live, we die. Plus Zahra's getting a 3D TV, so it all makes perfect sense, if you think about it."
558,558,6,Jeremy,False,12,"I'm not actually wearing a costume, Alan. So the joke's on you."
559,559,6,Jeremy,False,19,"Well, I didn't realise you knew that, so it can't have been a very good joke. Happy New Year."
560,560,6,Jeremy,False,6,Your alphabetical lists of French films?
561,561,6,Jeremy,False,22,Mmm-hmm. Don't you think there's a chance that Ben might be trying to reel you in? I'm not saying you're a fish.
562,562,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh, no, they're great lists. They're long lists. Maybe they do want to publish them."
563,563,6,Jeremy,True,9,Ugh. Day one and the housemate gets dicked over.
564,564,6,Jeremy,False,9,There ain't no party like a Super Hans party!
565,565,6,Jeremy,False,5,Let the punani hunt commence!
566,566,6,Jeremy,False,19,"Exactly. I've made a firm commitment. We're practically getting married, so this is basically my stag do. Free pass!"
567,567,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Always the marrying with you, isn't it?"
568,568,6,Jeremy,False,2,Super Hans!
569,569,6,Jeremy,False,8,"Wow, it is rocking out. You, OK, dude?"
570,570,6,Jeremy,False,1,Tasty.
571,571,6,Jeremy,False,3,Let's go in.
572,572,6,Jeremy,False,3,It sounds fun.
573,573,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Whatever, let's get in there!"
574,574,6,Jeremy,False,21,"Come on, dude! Sometimes you've gotta flip the switch, lift the rock and look what's underneath, cause it's not always woodlice."
575,575,6,Jeremy,False,3,Fine. Let's go.
576,576,6,Jeremy,False,25,"Look, I don't want to talk about it, all right? I just want a cup of tea and some soda bread and sit-down somewhere quiet."
577,577,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Yes, Mark, that's right. They're ""doing it"". You really have no imagination whatsoever, do you?"
578,578,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Dude, don't worry about them, because they sure as hell aren't worrying about you. Let's just go."
579,579,6,Jeremy,False,1,Hans?
580,580,6,Jeremy,False,3,Who's the chick?
581,581,6,Jeremy,False,5,Wow. And what does she...?
582,582,6,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
583,583,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, that's nice."
584,584,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Hey, Mark. I think Super Hans' girlfriend fancies me."
585,585,6,Jeremy,False,19,"In the fried chicken place, she bit off half a chicken drummer and then gave the rest to me."
586,586,6,Jeremy,False,6,The symbolism? The drummer's my dick.
587,587,6,Jeremy,False,3,She definitely was.
588,588,6,Jeremy,False,2,I'm sorry?
589,589,6,Jeremy,False,29,"Right. OK, man. Yeah. Good on you. Because, um, yeah I mean obviously, we've always been amazing mates, but, also a bit like lead weights dragging each other down?"
590,590,6,Jeremy,False,7,Too right. We're moving on! Eh! Eh!
591,591,6,Jeremy,True,21,"Yeah, Dobby can watch the History Channel with him and pretend to know the difference between all the old-time black-and-white dudes."
592,592,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Don't take no for an answer, dude."
593,593,6,Jeremy,True,7,"Yep, she fancies me. I knew it."
594,594,6,Jeremy,False,7,"I told you, Yoko's hot for me."
595,595,6,Jeremy,False,26,I've pulled the balancing hand a million times. She could have put that hand anywhere and yet it ends up inches from my Dirty Harry. Coincidence?
596,596,6,Jeremy,False,25,I do feel a bit weird about this. Big Suze has invited everyone except us. You know why? It's cause I sent her those... objects.
597,597,6,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah, sorry about that, Suze. I was feeling very um... look, if you like, we can all just-"
598,598,6,Jeremy,True,16,I was never any good as Suze's boyfriend. I should have been her butler all along.
599,599,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, that's probably us."
600,600,6,Jeremy,True,30,"Hello. She's looking at me. Maybe I should. Why not? Zahra hasn't phoned, texted or e-mailed for two hours. She's basically instructing me to have sex with a random woman."
601,601,6,Jeremy,True,47,"OK, let's crank up the flirt-a-thon, using a language I think she'll understand. Yoko Ono? Or Yoko Oh-yes?! Mm-hm. OK. Let's see if I can move it up a level. My hands are speaking sexy Esperanto. Hold on. Zahra! Oh, shit, it's the love of my life."
602,602,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, Zahra."
603,603,6,Jeremy,False,26,"OK, let's roll. I just spoke to Zahra. Ben tried it on with her. We're gonna pick her up. I need to take her somewhere cool."
604,604,6,Jeremy,False,29,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I've left it all in George Osborne's ball-sack. Tell you what, why don't you nip upstairs, wank him off and dip it in that?"
605,605,6,Jeremy,False,6,Let's go before we get fired.
606,606,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, the shit!"
607,607,6,Jeremy,True,6,Would've been a fucking long wait.
608,608,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Gorillaz, Mark. Gorillaz. Not The Monkees. Jesus!"
609,609,6,Jeremy,False,13,"How far down does this go, do you think? Can't be very far."
610,610,6,Jeremy,False,30,"No! Not the Hootenanny. Never the Hootenanny. We're better than that. We are going to this party! Come on, Mark. Scrabble. Help me scrabble. It's not long till the bongs!"
611,611,6,Jeremy,False,2,I know!
612,612,6,Jeremy,False,22,"Hey, Zahra, try and find some tarpaulin or some rags to wrap yourself up in for when you want to scramble under."
613,613,6,Jeremy,False,12,He might pop in. That's what I heard. He might pop in.
614,614,6,Jeremy,True,12,Shit. Oh no. She's finger-blabbing. Her hands are singing like a canary.
615,615,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, don't be a dick!"
616,616,6,Jeremy,False,13,"God, no. It wasn't sex, you know, it was just sexy hand signals."
617,617,6,Jeremy,False,52,"I- it was all a misunderstanding. I was in the kitchen, and I might have done a like that, for ""OK"" yeah, and then there were lots of little sausages around, so maybe I put the sausage in the ""OK"" to ask, ""Would you like to put a sausage in your mouth?"""
618,618,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
619,619,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Look, it's not my fault she doesn't speak English."
620,620,6,Jeremy,False,12,This kind of thing probably happens the whole time at the UN!
621,621,6,Jeremy,False,18,"But what about the bongs? What about the love nest? We're still OK for the love nest, yeah?"
622,622,6,Jeremy,True,10,"Oh, fuck, she's gone. My true love. My housing association!"
623,623,6,Jeremy,True,16,Standing in front of a thousand glory holes and no-one but Raymond to suck me off.
624,624,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Oh, she's gone. Yeah. I'm not gonna be moving in with her."
625,625,6,Jeremy,False,5,No. Did Dobby say yes?
626,626,6,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
627,627,6,Jeremy,False,28,"Uh-huh. Yeah, I could sleep under your desk. You could put your feet on me while you write your book. Could be fun, yeah, the three of us?"
628,628,6,Jeremy,True,9,He doesn't want me. He wants to move on.
629,629,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Although, actually, you know what? It's cool. Cause there's somewhere else I could stay."
630,630,6,Jeremy,False,42,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna move in with Super Hans. Yeah, I should've said. He asked me to move in with him and er... so everything's cool. Yeah, we're gonna have a mental blast, you know. And he's got that spare sleeping bag."
631,631,6,Jeremy,False,4,I think it's time.
632,632,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
633,633,1,Mark,True,9,Chipsticks or Frazzles? Chipsticks or Frazzles? Chipsticks or Frazzles?
634,634,1,Mark,False,7,"God, it's like a Stasi torture block."
635,635,1,Mark,False,8,"The phrase, ""no shit Sherlock"" comes to mind."
636,636,1,Mark,False,5,You don't wanna know mate.
637,637,1,Mark,False,11,"Well, you know, between your bum and your genitals, that area?"
638,638,1,Mark,False,8,"Yeah, well, imagine someone snipping it with scissors."
639,639,1,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, either that or you can have it pull apart like wet tissue paper. Sophie's mum."
640,640,1,Mark,False,1,Hello?
641,641,1,Mark,False,22,"She's in Northumberland. They're on their way, but it could be five or six hours. Shit, I can't be the birth partner."
642,642,1,Mark,False,18,"The truth is, and I really wish it wasn't true, but I'm a... a paedophobe, to be honest."
643,643,1,Mark,False,9,"I've always felt really... weird around children, you know?"
644,644,1,Mark,False,18,"I don't know, I mean what sort of help can you get for an irrational fear of children?"
645,645,1,Mark,False,10,"What did you think I meant? Oh, my God, Jeremy!"
646,646,1,Mark,False,17,"You thought I was saying I was a mega-paedo? And your reaction was that ""you'd always wondered""?"
647,647,1,Mark,False,22,"I'm just going back in, I was only looking at the crisps and I got distracted. I've been three minutes max, honestly."
648,648,1,Mark,True,11,"You're nice, I wish I was having a baby with you."
649,649,1,Mark,False,3,The cervical sweep.
650,650,1,Mark,False,12,"So listen, I've spoken to your mum and she's on her way."
651,651,1,Mark,False,27,"But hold your horses just one sec, because they are actually on their way from Northumberland, so until she gets here, I am very much your man."
652,652,1,Mark,False,1,Oh...
653,653,1,Mark,True,13,"What do I say? Can't sit back and watch, eating popcorn. Can't alleviate."
654,654,1,Mark,False,6,"Ow, poor Soph, does it hurt?"
655,655,1,Mark,False,4,Might be your mum.
656,656,1,Mark,False,18,"Hello? Oh, what? The boiler? You're kidding! But, it's just, no, sorry, thank you. I'll get it sorted."
657,657,1,Mark,False,32,"Wasn't your mum, it was just... a tiny thing, my boiler... it's nothing. It's cool, it's nothing, minor explosion. Forget it, I'm focused, OK, baby. Apparently, there's water leaking downst- so irrelevant."
658,658,1,Mark,False,5,"Right, OK, the TENS machine."
659,659,1,Mark,True,19,"While my flat fills with water, what you need is an almost imperceptibly low dose of battery-powered pain relief."
660,660,1,Mark,False,6,"Sure, understood, I won't get anxious."
661,661,1,Mark,True,17,"Placid lake of water, placid lake of water filling up my flat from the gushing broken boiler."
662,662,1,Mark,False,9,"Oh, what, water birth, isn't that a bit... zany?"
663,663,1,Mark,False,11,"OK then, I'm on it, Soph, I'm on it for you."
664,664,1,Mark,False,2,Will do.
665,665,1,Mark,True,23,"OK, birthing pool, don't believe in it but I have to sell it. I'm Clare Short backing Iraq, Trinny and Susannah endorsing Nescafé."
666,666,1,Mark,False,11,"Hi, hello, I wondered what happened to the nurse from before?"
667,667,1,Mark,False,4,The one who was...
668,668,1,Mark,True,1,nice
669,669,1,Mark,False,1,here.
670,670,1,Mark,False,14,"Ah, oh, OK. Well, we, er, discussed the possibility, earlier of using a pool."
671,671,1,Mark,True,23,"Great, Yana's a flake. The lovely nurse who doesn't write anything down. She probably only works here to get her hands on ludes."
672,672,1,Mark,False,40,"Look, I need a pool, OK? We want a natural birth. God knows some people aren't convinced of the benefits of a water birth, but I for one am not one of them. So, please could you sort that out?"
673,673,1,Mark,True,19,"Good day? God, I'm so stern. Maybe I'll end up marrying her instead and we'll have brisk, clinical sex."
674,674,1,Mark,False,13,"I estimate we're looking at a five centimetre cervix, plus the boiler's exploded."
675,675,1,Mark,False,8,Who was that good plumber? Sophie's nice guy?
676,676,1,Mark,False,1,Really?
677,677,1,Mark,False,2,"Thanks, man."
678,678,1,Mark,False,40,"OK, pretty tough but I managed it. I said, listen, you do things our way. My birth partner has requested this and I don't care if I have to take it to the very top of the GMC, got it?"
679,679,1,Mark,False,8,"OK. Is that better, or is that better?"
680,680,1,Mark,False,4,Or is that better?
681,681,1,Mark,False,13,"Soph, it's OK, we'll get you in the pool, I'm gonna sort it."
682,682,1,Mark,False,6,"Oh, you don't want the pool?"
683,683,1,Mark,False,17,"It's just I did ask very firmly for the pool. If I go back now, I'll look-"
684,684,1,Mark,False,59,"It's just, it'll weaken my negotiating position. No, Soph, yep, I'm on it, just a tiny query. Can you remember, not at your last place, but the place before, the name of that nice plumber? Was it Tom or Tim? No biggie, but if it jumps into your head, can you just pop the number down there, would you?"
685,685,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
686,686,1,Mark,False,41,"Yes, well as it happens, things have changed and my partner no longer requires the pool. No, we want the what's it called, the drugs pipe, the heroin pump, the crack tube, whatever you've got. I want to stop her suffering."
687,687,1,Mark,True,11,"Hmmm. You might be ripe for a trim, in the cuts."
688,688,1,Mark,False,1,Jez?
689,689,1,Mark,False,4,What are you doing?
690,690,1,Mark,False,2,But why?
691,691,1,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
692,692,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, OK."
693,693,1,Mark,False,1,Nothing.
694,694,1,Mark,False,1,Nothing.
695,695,1,Mark,False,3,"No, it's fine."
696,696,1,Mark,False,1,Nothing.
697,697,1,Mark,False,22,"Jeremy, it's fine. I'm actually quite glad it's all a filthy duplicitous ploy. I was worried you had a complete personality change."
698,698,1,Mark,False,3,"Yes. Normally, yes."
699,699,1,Mark,False,22,"I should be getting back to Sophie. Jez, would you consider coming with me? I don't think I'm coping all that well."
700,700,1,Mark,False,3,You don't mind?
701,701,1,Mark,False,6,"Hey, Soph, it's me, and Jez!"
702,702,1,Mark,False,33,"OK, look, I went crazy at them, I totally lost it actually, but the thing is that the anaesthetist has this C-section now, and then there's another procedure that he's booked in to-"
703,703,1,Mark,False,19,"Look, the anaesthetist can't be in two places at once. I mean, I wish he could, but he can't."
704,704,1,Mark,True,8,How did I become the hospital's spin doctor?
705,705,1,Mark,True,11,"Hmm, stuck on the medical channel and there's no remote control."
706,706,1,Mark,False,5,"Yes, yeah, maybe some music."
707,707,1,Mark,True,10,What a bastard. That's gonna drive us all totally bonkers.
708,708,1,Mark,False,1,Blimey.
709,709,1,Mark,False,2,"No, God."
710,710,1,Mark,True,12,"Of course, brings the insufferable music, then goes. He's like the 1980s."
711,711,1,Mark,False,8,"Hello, Hans? Oh, OK, I'll be right down."
712,712,1,Mark,False,13,"That was Super Hans. He's here, he wants money to fix the boiler."
713,713,1,Mark,False,12,You called Super Hans about the boiler? Super Hans is our plumber?
714,714,1,Mark,False,18,"Oh, great, I wonder if he appears on the CORGI Gas Safe Register, or just the sex offenders."
715,715,1,Mark,True,15,"That's right, pay Hans to do the plumbing, swap the cow for some magic beans."
716,716,1,Mark,False,5,"Half a monkey, as requested."
717,717,1,Mark,True,13,Why am I dealing in animals? No animal-based transaction has ever gone well.
718,718,1,Mark,True,19,I'll probably end up with half a Ford Escort and some porno tapes and we'll call it all square.
719,719,1,Mark,False,4,Is he the plumber?
720,720,1,Mark,False,19,"You know, for a while it's been pretty boring but I think we're getting to the utterly terrifying bit."
721,721,1,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
722,722,1,Mark,False,1,Right.
723,723,1,Mark,False,1,What?
724,724,1,Mark,False,5,Isn't it pretty amazing anyway?
725,725,1,Mark,True,25,"If those two fix my boiler, I think it will be more surprising than if Sophie gave birth to a working replica of Stephenson's Rocket."
726,726,1,Mark,False,8,"Hi, Soph, back now, can I do anything?"
727,727,1,Mark,True,21,"Oh, God, the screaming, poor Sophie. I definitely couldn't give birth. I want to call Dignitas when I get lumbar pain."
728,728,1,Mark,True,26,I can't just keep standing to attention like Captain Mark Phillips. Could march around the room like Nelson on his quarterdeck. I'm just a spare part.
729,729,1,Mark,True,24,"And the fun part is, everything I do is basically wrong. If I can just get hold of a hand, that might feel useful."
730,730,1,Mark,False,34,"Right, right, yes, I'm sure, but just don't use all your energy, 'cause you did say that eight hours ago, and it wasn't now, and I don't want to be a doubting Thomas, but-"
731,731,1,Mark,True,8,Is that for me or just general bastarding?
732,732,1,Mark,True,28,"If she keeps saying fuck off, I might fuck off. That's gotta be within your rights, to fuck off, if someone repeatedly screams at you to fuck off."
733,733,1,Mark,False,12,Can I- I just need to nip to the little boys' room.
734,734,1,Mark,True,8,"Yeah, the little boys' room, for little boys."
735,735,1,Mark,True,71,"Yeah, OK, off to the toilet, have a wee and then back in. I could walk quicker, but it's interesting to note that I'm not. I'm walking at what I would describe in court as a normal pace, but which I think is actually slightly slower than normal. There's the toilet. Hmm, why didn't I go in? Here I go, into here. OK, this is interesting, where am I going now?"
736,736,1,Mark,True,57,"I think this is OK, this is something somebody might do in my situation. ""My wife was going into labour, and I decided to leave her ever so briefly, to grab something to eat to fortify me for the events ahead"". ""Oh, right, that sounds wise, that you got a chicken bucket early on"". ""Yes, I know."""
737,737,1,Mark,False,3,"Chicken bucket, please."
738,738,1,Mark,False,4,"Yes, I can wait."
739,739,1,Mark,True,38,"Eating from a bucket like a human horse. I feel refreshed and replenished and now back to the hospital. No need to run, and still got some beans and a sweetcorn for Sophie. Probably just what she fancies."
740,740,1,Mark,True,52,"Hmmm. Is this the worst thing I've ever done? It might be. You can't hide behind that pillar, I'm a sharpshooter. I bet she's OK, all the staff. I'm better off here, I'm safe here, with the gangsters in the killing zone. The abandoned subway station, my safe place, my good place."
741,741,1,Mark,True,29,"Oddball alert, do not respond, do not engage. Oh, God, he's broken through my icy force field. Maybe he's having a baby, maybe everyone in here is having babies."
742,742,1,Mark,True,6,"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!"
743,743,1,Mark,False,1,Jez?
744,744,1,Mark,False,13,"Yeah, well, Sophie wanted me to grab five and play some Lethal Enforcers."
745,745,1,Mark,False,13,"Yeah, she was all, grab five, Mark, you deserve it, I'll be fine."
746,746,1,Mark,False,7,"Yeah, I know, that's because I'm lying."
747,747,1,Mark,True,19,"He's right, thank God I didn't do bottle of whisky and random easyJet. I can still pull this round."
748,748,1,Mark,False,4,"Hi. Oh, you're not..."
749,749,1,Mark,True,13,"That could so easily have been me, a useless gnome, fishing for turds."
750,750,1,Mark,False,7,"Sorry, this should be my birth, where's-"
751,751,1,Mark,False,1,Theatre?
752,752,1,Mark,True,11,"Theatre, nothing good has ever happened in a theatre. Oh, fuck!"
753,753,1,Mark,False,4,"Sophie, are you OK?"
754,754,1,Mark,False,13,"I'm so sorry I went, I just... I don't know what to say."
755,755,1,Mark,False,10,"Oh, how long? Oh... ages. Like, three or four minutes."
756,756,1,Mark,True,18,"This is amazing, I could have finished the level, had an Angry Whopper and upgraded my phone tariff."
757,757,1,Mark,False,24,"That's brilliant, I love the salad, now I'll try the birth. The Caesar... Caesarean salad, sorry, I'm gabbling. I'm just happy it's all OK."
758,758,1,Mark,False,1,Oh-
759,759,1,Mark,True,16,"Holy fuck, living innards, I thought now it'll be hi-tech, chip and pin, not London Dungeon."
760,760,1,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
761,761,1,Mark,False,4,"All... good, all great."
762,762,1,Mark,True,14,The screen's there for a reason. There's a reason they put Guantanamo on Cuba.
763,763,1,Mark,True,18,"Yeah, I imagine so, because a human being is being heaved out of your body. Oh, my goodness."
764,764,1,Mark,False,1,Er...
765,765,1,Mark,True,20,No! Do you want to do some credit rating or work in a Mexican restaurant? Let's stick to our jobs!
766,766,1,Mark,False,4,Do people normally- ?
767,767,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, OK."
768,768,1,Mark,True,21,"Great, bet I do it wrong and they laugh. Humiliated in front of my son within ten seconds of his birth."
769,769,1,Mark,False,3,"Wow, it's sinewy."
770,770,1,Mark,True,109,"God, I can't get any purchase. Thought it would be like Sarah Ferguson, cutting a ribbon, but it's much more meaty, like sawing a dog's leg in half. Oh, my God, there he is, I've got a baby. Maybe, maybe I might be a good person from now on. That might be a good idea. Yeah, lead a wholesome life and be a decent citizen and make the whole world OK, and yeah, this is a biggie, this is definitely a biggie. Maybe my son can sort climate change. He might figure out cold fusion! Not as one of the main guys, that's unrealistic, but in an administrative capacity."
771,771,1,Mark,False,2,I know.
772,772,1,Mark,False,1,Oh?
773,773,1,Mark,False,3,Minimal water damage?
774,774,1,Mark,True,3,"Oh, my God."
775,775,1,Mark,False,5,My son. Minimal water damage.
776,776,2,Mark,True,39,"Got to have the equipment when the baby comes to stay. The empty buggy, I feel like a maniac whose just dumped his baby in the corner of JD Sports with a rusk and ten euros tapped to it."
777,777,2,Mark,False,4,Yeah it is cool.
778,778,2,Mark,True,23,"More like a honey trap for social retards. When the Normalo Nazis firebomb these places, the geek race will be wiped out forever."
779,779,2,Mark,False,15,So what was the amazing Dobby news that you had to tell me in person?
780,780,2,Mark,False,7,"Don't do the X-Factor on me, Gerrard."
781,781,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, God. Really?"
782,782,2,Mark,True,15,"Us? I'm several social ranks your senior. That's the whole basis of our relationship, Gerrard."
783,783,2,Mark,False,4,"So, what's he like?"
784,784,2,Mark,False,18,"Oh, please. ""Hello, can I redesign your logo?"" ""Yes, that'll be a hundred thousand pounds for a squiggle."""
785,785,2,Mark,True,6,Wish I was a graphic designer.
786,786,2,Mark,True,3,But of course.
787,787,2,Mark,False,3,"""Vorsprung dick Technik""."
788,788,2,Mark,True,5,Wish I had an Audi.
789,789,2,Mark,True,11,"Don't pull me into your filthy bath water, I'm a player."
790,790,2,Mark,False,6,"Uh, yes you do surprise me."
791,791,2,Mark,True,5,You've been with a woman?
792,792,2,Mark,False,17,"Yeah, I guess over the years I've had a bit of a tough time with the ladies."
793,793,2,Mark,False,45,"I've done some mad shit though. I remember there was this one time at Uni and I was trying it on with this chick and getting nowhere, so I pulled the old palm reading routine, physical contact. Ended up going back to her place. Sweet."
794,794,2,Mark,False,2,Oh yeah.
795,795,2,Mark,True,17,Then I talked to her all night about my mother's suspected infidelities until I started to cry.
796,796,2,Mark,False,7,I've got a million stories like that.
797,797,2,Mark,False,1,What?
798,798,2,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, the detail's not bad."
799,799,2,Mark,True,2,"Danger, Mark."
800,800,2,Mark,False,8,Right. God. Well they're not really my thing.
801,801,2,Mark,False,10,Yeah? I mean I suppose if you were really keen.
802,802,2,Mark,True,27,"I do want the FDR doll, but is it crossing a line? Oh my God, my heart's racing. It's like when I bought my first twenty-sided die."
803,803,2,Mark,False,8,"I'd like to buy an FDR doll, please."
804,804,2,Mark,False,13,"It's for my son, he's a big fan of the New Deal, so..."
805,805,2,Mark,False,2,What's that?
806,806,2,Mark,False,13,"I feel uneasy about the noises, Gerrard. Anyway, would a Cyberman attack Roosevelt?"
807,807,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, hi Jez."
808,808,2,Mark,False,24,"We're not, were just arranging our models... with some noises. Anyway, what are you doing back from your new job so early? Fired already?"
809,809,2,Mark,False,7,That's his motto? What's his annual turnover?
810,810,2,Mark,False,5,What does that even mean?
811,811,2,Mark,False,48,"Look, I'm sorry if in an infantilised world I've somehow ended up with a non-cool toys, but why exactly is arranging a model of the greatest liberal hero of the twentieth century somehow less cool than pretending on a computer that you're a Russian pimp stealing imaginary cars."
812,812,2,Mark,False,6,"For God's sake, Jeremy, that's disgusting."
813,813,2,Mark,False,5,"Well, you know, on occasion."
814,814,2,Mark,True,15,"Ah, we're the Dobby Club. Or the Dobby ring. Can two people be a ring?"
815,815,2,Mark,False,3,Why ever not?
816,816,2,Mark,True,7,Relationship commandos wreaking havoc behind enemy lines.
817,817,2,Mark,False,2,Our pleasure.
818,818,2,Mark,True,12,The cracks are starting to show. The cracks are starting to show!
819,819,2,Mark,False,16,"Nice work bringing up renewable energy, Gerrard. Looks like they're having a full and frank discussion."
820,820,2,Mark,False,5,"Um, right yeah, good point."
821,821,2,Mark,True,15,"This is it, this is my Yalta. Dobby's Poland, I'm wily Stalin. Out-foxing sickly FDR."
822,822,2,Mark,False,2,Why not?
823,823,2,Mark,True,18,"Except, is FDR dead by Yalta? Gerrard's Truman with the A bomb. Relax Mark, not actually at Yalta."
824,824,2,Mark,False,2,"Heads, obviously."
825,825,2,Mark,True,14,"If I win, I win. If I lose, I'll simply ignore it. Stalin's prerogative."
826,826,2,Mark,False,15,"Too bad. Well, to this unshakable pact of brothers do we swear enduring honour. Yes?"
827,827,2,Mark,True,32,"Dobby, where in cyberspace are you? No updates for seventy-two hours. Is this a bit like stalking? Stalking's a very loaded term. I prefer to think of it as an extreme liking."
828,828,2,Mark,False,15,"Jez? It's twelve on a Saturday, and you're up? You've been out? Are you tripping?"
829,829,2,Mark,False,6,But I thought work never starts?
830,830,2,Mark,False,2,Never stops?
831,831,2,Mark,False,3,Well that's something.
832,832,2,Mark,False,1,Merch?
833,833,2,Mark,False,21,"Yeah, murdering your enemies is quite a simple solution. Which I guess is why in ethics and law it's so frowned-upon."
834,834,2,Mark,False,27,"Yes, of course. Safest place for him. Stable temperature, plus if there was an earth tremor, Which, obviously, there isn't going to be, he's got added protection."
835,835,2,Mark,False,25,"I've got him for the day. It's amazing, the bond. Earlier, I was changing him and he pissed all over me. No ill feeling, nothing."
836,836,2,Mark,False,11,"Exactly, plus if you went for him now, I'd stab you."
837,837,2,Mark,False,5,Stab you in the eyes.
838,838,2,Mark,False,31,"Hey watch this. Time me. Imagine the cushion is the baby. Do you see? If there was a bus coming, I could strip and fold this beauty in under five seconds."
839,839,2,Mark,False,16,Jeremy! Come! Come and look at this. You have to come and look at this now!
840,840,2,Mark,False,9,This was taken less than half an hour ago.
841,841,2,Mark,False,18,"Dobby's updated, she's not in a relationship but she is at her bloody sister's birthday do... with Gerrard!"
842,842,2,Mark,False,18,"He's done the dirty on me, Jez. He's making a mockery of our Granita moment. He's Blairing me."
843,843,2,Mark,False,11,Gordon Brown didn't actually have a metal fist. It was just...
844,844,2,Mark,False,9,"Hold on, I didn't think we had any milk."
845,845,2,Mark,False,21,"No, we definitely don't because I couldn't have any Sultana Bran this morning. There's no milk in the fridge. Except... Oh!"
846,846,2,Mark,False,6,"This is Sophie's milk, isn't it?"
847,847,2,Mark,False,9,Jeremy this- it's- it's one step away from cannibalism!
848,848,2,Mark,False,5,"Yes, it bloody well is."
849,849,2,Mark,False,12,"Look at him, he's the worst kind of snake in the grass."
850,850,2,Mark,False,10,"I mean, obviously I'd have betrayed him like that, but..."
851,851,2,Mark,False,17,"Yeah, exactly Jez, thank you. He, oh my God he's- that's my idea! He's using my idea!"
852,852,2,Mark,False,12,He's juicing my balls! He's trying to screw her with my cock.
853,853,2,Mark,True,29,"Great, I've got a front row seat in the theatre of cruelty. Ugh, just watching them is making these normally delicious butterscotch treats turn to ash in my mouth."
854,854,2,Mark,False,17,I'm going in. Tony B. Liar can disregard the U.N. but he can't disregard the Dobby Club.
855,855,2,Mark,False,9,I could ask you the very same question. Judas.
856,856,2,Mark,False,4,"How incredibly thoughtful, Brutus."
857,857,2,Mark,False,9,You knew very well that we had a deal.
858,858,2,Mark,True,5,Can't think of another one.
859,859,2,Mark,False,2,Double Judas.
860,860,2,Mark,False,42,"I think you're doing a little more than that. No doubt once you've finished these, and she sufficiently high on E numbers, you'll try and supply her with another pork product whose name I don't think needs to be said out loud."
861,861,2,Mark,False,15,"Unlike you, Gerrard, I'm a man of my word. The Dobby Club is officially dissolved."
862,862,2,Mark,False,10,I shall be completing the HMS Victory without your assistance.
863,863,2,Mark,False,14,You had your chance to help me with that rigging. And you blew it.
864,864,2,Mark,False,1,Hello.
865,865,2,Mark,False,8,Gerrard had to go. He was taken ill.
866,866,2,Mark,False,13,"A bit, but also you needn't give it a second thought. The squits."
867,867,2,Mark,True,4,No further details required.
868,868,2,Mark,False,2,May I?
869,869,2,Mark,False,10,"Yeah but I was in the car, I'm on standby."
870,870,2,Mark,False,32,"As Gerrard's replacement. It's cool, we look out for one another. Like me and Jez, he's right over there, so if, God forbid, something should happen, he'll be there to replace me."
871,871,2,Mark,False,18,"Look, Dobby the truth is, me and Gerrard, we have a a sort of a club about you."
872,872,2,Mark,False,37,"It's not a real club, there's no clubhouse and there's only two of us. It's more of a shared passion, if you will. It's quite sophisticated. Like the Sunday Times wine club. But it's ironic too, so..."
873,873,2,Mark,True,4,"Hmm, not nailing this."
874,874,2,Mark,False,18,"No more than usual, he agreed to step aside. Abort your date and let me have a pop."
875,875,2,Mark,False,7,"Not a pop, a go, a turn."
876,876,2,Mark,True,6,Really not nailing this at all.
877,877,2,Mark,False,21,"Excuse me. Hello, how are you? Hungry? Or another one of your dirty protests? Oh, no you're good, just a blanket."
878,878,2,Mark,True,4,"Oh OK, of course."
879,879,2,Mark,False,8,If you like you can smell my baby.
880,880,2,Mark,False,11,"That new baby smell, it's amazing. It's like caramel and roses."
881,881,2,Mark,True,14,Total emperor's new clothes. They smell of baby soap and very faintly of urine.
882,882,2,Mark,True,10,"Nice. The ultimate aphrodisiac, my son's like a huge oyster."
883,883,2,Mark,False,49,"Look, the truth is, I came out here because I was insane with jealousy and if that's freaky than ill just go. But, the thing about driving for miles to spy on someone is that, if nothing else, it does sort of prove that you have quite strong feelings."
884,884,2,Mark,False,21,"Look, if there's nothing happening with you and Gerrard, does that actually mean that there's a... position vacant? As your boyfriend?"
885,885,2,Mark,True,11,"Oh my god, I've won. I'm resigning from the FDR/Cyberman conflict."
886,886,2,Mark,True,45,"OK, wow. This is it. The ultimate. I'm in a relationship with someone I really like. Something's obviously gonna have to go wrong. I wonder what it's gonna be? It's almost definitely gonna be something I do. I need to watch myself like a hawk."
887,887,2,Mark,True,20,"Is she thinking about her ex? Bet she bloody is. When she goes quiet, is she always thinking about him?"
888,888,2,Mark,False,5,"You having a look, there?"
889,889,2,Mark,True,23,"It's impossible to know what's going on in her head. And if I ask her, she doesn't necessarily have to tell the truth."
890,890,2,Mark,False,8,"So, come on, what are you thinking, Dobs?"
891,891,2,Mark,False,4,"Right. Yeah, me too."
892,892,2,Mark,True,55,"Oh, sure. Why is she a separate entity? There should be a viewing platform to see into her brain. If only I could get her brain in a jar, or hook her up to electrodes. I need thermal imaging of her brain cortex and a lab to analyse it afterwards. Then, I could finally relax."
893,893,2,Mark,False,7,"Me too, that, that would be terrible."
894,894,2,Mark,True,17,"Ugh, the ghost at the feast. I'm going to kill you, Gerrard. Kill you till you're dead."
895,895,2,Mark,False,9,Although there is something I should probably tell you.
896,896,2,Mark,False,6,I don't really want to say...
897,897,2,Mark,False,19,"Well, You know those Corfu pictures you've got on your profile? I think maybe you should take those down."
898,898,2,Mark,False,12,Well Gerrard admitted that sometimes he looks at them and does a...
899,899,2,Mark,False,2,I know.
900,900,2,Mark,True,14,"Never pick a fight with Stalin, Gerrard. Uncle Joe don't play by your rules."
901,901,3,Mark,True,32,"Sex over, now the smiling and staring. I think Dobby might be bored with me sexually. I'm vanilla. I should be, not Neapolitan, that's too '70s, but pistachio, slightly unpleasant but novel."
902,902,3,Mark,False,12,I was thinking of booking that country house hotel for your birthday.
903,903,3,Mark,False,23,No way! I'm being the man here and paying for everything. I'm taking you away. I might even carry you over the threshold.
904,904,3,Mark,False,10,Would you be able to drive us? It's in Hereford.
905,905,3,Mark,False,1,Thanks.
906,906,3,Mark,True,15,"Officially it's a towelling robe. Might not be incredibly stylish, but it is hugely absorbent."
907,907,3,Mark,False,4,How horrible for him.
908,908,3,Mark,True,20,"The cool, good looking ex-boyfriend whom I strongly suspect was far better in bed than me. His grief is mine."
909,909,3,Mark,False,2,Hang on.
910,910,3,Mark,True,5,Must be the Barnardo's man.
911,911,3,Mark,False,1,Right.
912,912,3,Mark,True,13,Is he though? I'm pretty sure I saw this exposed on Rogue Traders.
913,913,3,Mark,False,5,"So, what have you got?"
914,914,3,Mark,True,22,"Shit, OK don't choose the cheapest in front of Dobby. So not J-cloths. Not scourers. Fluffy dusters? I think they're relatively cheap."
915,915,3,Mark,False,2,Fluffy duster?
916,916,3,Mark,False,2,They're what?
917,917,3,Mark,True,4,I'm being politely mugged!
918,918,3,Mark,True,12,"Great, just wasted eleven pounds on four pounds worth of female approval."
919,919,3,Mark,False,17,"Right, I'm having that back. You've conned me, I'm not some frail old lady in sheltered housing."
920,920,3,Mark,False,13,It's fine. Things got a bit out of hand but I took control.
921,921,3,Mark,False,2,Since when?
922,922,3,Mark,False,7,"Well that's very sensible, albeit hallucinatory, advice."
923,923,3,Mark,False,6,"I don't want it, it's illegal!"
924,924,3,Mark,False,1,OK.
925,925,3,Mark,False,2,With wood?
926,926,3,Mark,False,2,No we-
927,927,3,Mark,False,3,We've got salt.
928,928,3,Mark,False,14,"Jez, I'm... I'm slightly worried that Dobby might still be in love with Simon."
929,929,3,Mark,False,8,"Do you mean yeah, you think she is?"
930,930,3,Mark,False,8,And I'm worried that I might not be...
931,931,3,Mark,False,9,"Look, you know the actual, the act of intercourse?"
932,932,3,Mark,False,13,What would you say was the average amount of time before the man...
933,933,3,Mark,False,24,"Yes. I want the average amount of time, the mean. No, the mode or median. Sting's probably thrown the mean out for everyone else."
934,934,3,Mark,False,26,"No, I don't wanna hear about the bum Jeremy. I know for you it all revolves around the bum, you're like the Copernicus of the anus."
935,935,3,Mark,False,24,"It's not much of a secret though, is it, Jeremy? Be honest, the bum is quite, if you'll pardon the image, an open secret."
936,936,3,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, I am a bit desperate on that front. I mean, I've even bought a..."
937,937,3,Mark,False,1,Nothing.
938,938,3,Mark,False,8,It's a dildo. I've bought a big dildo.
939,939,3,Mark,False,44,"Nine inches. It's a nine-incher. Thought it might spice things up. Trouble is, I find it quite intimidating, as a man. I mean look at it, it's like a leg of lamb. So I've decided to call it ""Kenneth"", to take the curse off."
940,940,3,Mark,False,17,"Yes. ""My colleague, Kenneth. Shall I fetch Kenneth? Meet my sexual associate, Kenneth."" Makes him less daunting."
941,941,3,Mark,False,39,"No. I mean, it might be the sexiest thing ever or it might be a massive disaster. Dobby might hate it. So for now you stay at Brize Norton, Kenneth. I don't think you're ready to enter Helmand yet."
942,942,3,Mark,False,28,I despise every second of it. We're short staffed and Gail keeps making me do these extra shifts. And she hates me since you tried to kill her.
943,943,3,Mark,False,31,"But then she'll fire me. I don't want to be unemployed, I've got a girlfriend to impress. And when Sophie gets back from Wales, I've also got a baby to impress."
944,944,3,Mark,False,2,Of testicles?
945,945,3,Mark,False,38,You want me to grow a pair of testicles so I'd have four testicles and somehow that'll help make me braver and better able to deal with stress? Staggering around like a baboon with four balls hanging down.
946,946,3,Mark,False,31,A new anus? So she'd have two anuses? And then in this mad new world of yours I'd presumably shove my four bollocks up her two anuses for some unknown reason.
947,947,3,Mark,True,27,"Tension headache. Brain tumour maybe? Sexy, fascinating, roguish brain tumour? Not with my luck. I think I will ask Gail if I can take some time off."
948,948,3,Mark,False,18,"Right. Gail, when you've got a second, later maybe, I was wondering whether my taking some holiday might-"
949,949,3,Mark,False,1,Erm-
950,950,3,Mark,True,44,"Good to get that out in the open. At least I know where I stand now. I'm precisely where I was a second ago, but quite a bit more upset. Shit, it's the rogue trader. I wonder if his dish perchance cost eleven pounds."
951,951,3,Mark,False,3,Enjoy your meals.
952,952,3,Mark,True,4,"Just keep walking, Mark."
953,953,3,Mark,True,5,And now walk back Mark.
954,954,3,Mark,False,6,"I think you did, Burritos Deluxe?"
955,955,3,Mark,False,19,"No. Um, oh, right yes, I'm afraid my colleague who took your order must have made a mistake so-"
956,956,3,Mark,False,7,"True, but I was only following orders."
957,957,3,Mark,True,3,Like Vince Cable.
958,958,3,Mark,True,48,"Fine, right, fine. OK great, you want the jalapeño sauce, mate? Well, you can have the jalapeño sauce. But with my hot, yellow piss in it. Yeah, see how you like this. I can't go! I can't piss! Come on bladder, please let me piss in the sauce!"
959,959,3,Mark,False,10,Am I sacked? Should I go? I bet I'm sacked.
960,960,3,Mark,False,6,Dobby will definitely dump me now.
961,961,3,Mark,False,12,She's got a special look of pity for unemployed people. Like this.
962,962,3,Mark,False,21,"Anyway, we won't be able to go away for her birthday now. We'll be stuck here with own-brand couscous and Wallander."
963,963,3,Mark,False,32,And what about losing all your money? Or shitting yourself in public? Or the tabloid press mistakenly outing you as a paedo? Or Alzheimer's? Or all of those things plus you're drowning?
964,964,3,Mark,False,21,"Oh Jesus, you're in love with Zahra, aren't you? You shouldn't be in love with her, Jeremy, you're playing with fire."
965,965,3,Mark,False,1,Water?
966,966,3,Mark,True,11,Kenneth's lair. Should I? Shouldn't I? Would Kenneth be welcomed now?
967,967,3,Mark,False,6,Should I get a condom or-?
968,968,3,Mark,False,18,"They're in the sock drawer. Hang on a sec, and then we can let the enjoyable sex continue."
969,969,3,Mark,True,13,"I don't know what to do. In a way Kenneth, I hate you."
970,970,3,Mark,False,6,"Sorry they're in here somewhere, Dobs."
971,971,3,Mark,True,1,Great.
972,972,3,Mark,True,7,"You're off duty Kenneth, stand at ease."
973,973,3,Mark,True,21,Could I say my Mum's dead? Would Dobby maybe believe that long enough for me to go home and shoot Mum?
974,974,3,Mark,False,3,You should go.
975,975,3,Mark,True,21,"Nicely selfless. I can't control what she does, but at least I can make her feel guilty while she does it."
976,976,3,Mark,False,3,Very tragic indeed.
977,977,3,Mark,False,2,Is he?
978,978,3,Mark,True,14,"Superb. Young, good looking, sexy and now rich. Perhaps the fucker can also teleport."
979,979,3,Mark,False,5,Is that a book Jeremy?
980,980,3,Mark,False,5,Why do you have it?
981,981,3,Mark,False,8,You're gonna read a book? You hate reading.
982,982,3,Mark,False,6,How's the book going? Enjoying it?
983,983,3,Mark,False,2,I see.
984,984,3,Mark,False,8,You want me to teach you to read?
985,985,3,Mark,False,8,"Well, turn the telly off for a start."
986,986,3,Mark,False,7,"OK, start reading that long paragraph there."
987,987,3,Mark,False,12,You probably feel like looking away from the page now don't you?
988,988,3,Mark,False,6,Don't look away. Stay with it.
989,989,3,Mark,True,11,Fascinating. It's like watching a sheep try to use an iPhone.
990,990,3,Mark,False,21,"Well, why don't you talk about Mr. Nice instead? About all the different times Mr. Nice got high... to different extents."
991,991,3,Mark,True,14,There he is. The Captain Oates of having to read a relatively short book.
992,992,3,Mark,False,2,My legs.
993,993,3,Mark,False,9,I'm not staying up all night reading Wuthering Heights.
994,994,3,Mark,False,8,"Look, I'm broke and you're relatively moneyed, so..."
995,995,3,Mark,False,34,"Deals happen every day Jeremy. Buying a Twix is a deal. Paying for the toilet at Euston is a deal. I'll read the book. I'll look at some online criticism, but for a price."
996,996,3,Mark,False,11,"I'm not a prostitute, now please get out of my bed."
997,997,3,Mark,False,27,"Yes. So the birthday weekend's going ahead if you're still up for it, all the complimentary shower caps we can wear and proper cafetieres in the rooms."
998,998,3,Mark,False,4,No it's fine I'm-
999,999,3,Mark,False,2,"Yes, listening."
1000,1000,3,Mark,False,1,Sorry.
1001,1001,3,Mark,False,20,"Well, I am very tired. I was up half the night reading- oh, I see. Yeah, got you. Bed. Lovely."
1002,1002,3,Mark,False,13,"Yes, something else has come up, Jez, I can't do the book group."
1003,1003,3,Mark,False,17,"I need to renege on the deal, Jez. I really have got something else I'd rather do."
1004,1004,3,Mark,False,3,There you go.
1005,1005,3,Mark,False,13,"Jeremy's right, he's a shit. Can we go in for five minutes, Dobs?"
1006,1006,3,Mark,False,29,"Savage rhapsody? Sorry Ben, very easily done, but I think you might accidentally be giving opinions from quite a well known online essay on Wuthering Heights as your own."
1007,1007,3,Mark,False,21,"...hasn't understood the book at all. Wuthering Heights isn't a hymn to lust and passion, it's about hoe finite and shallow..."
1008,1008,3,Mark,False,20,".. all this Gothic nonsense is and how it inevitably has to give way to real life, and real love."
1009,1009,3,Mark,True,19,This is what I was born to do. It's like Robert Robinson fucked Joan Bakewell and they had me.
1010,1010,3,Mark,False,3,Back to yours?
1011,1011,3,Mark,False,23,"It's all right Jez, I'm just off to Dobby's and I don't think I'll be needing to be ""friends with Kenneth"" any more."
1012,1012,3,Mark,False,8,Indeed. I think Kenneth can take a hike.
1013,1013,4,Mark,False,13,"Where the hell are you, Jeremy? We're gonna be late for the christening."
1014,1014,4,Mark,False,18,"I'm at the station, where you were supposed to be fifteen minutes ago. I'm in a phone box."
1015,1015,4,Mark,False,8,"No, I've simply got rid of my mobile."
1016,1016,4,Mark,False,28,"We've got a landline. Times are hard, Jeremy. I'm putting my clarinet on eBay, I'm making my own hummus. This is the end times. A mobile's a luxury."
1017,1017,4,Mark,False,11,"Look, where the hell are you? I'm coming to get you."
1018,1018,4,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
1019,1019,4,Mark,False,12,"Well, be ready. We've missed the train, I'll get us a cab."
1020,1020,4,Mark,False,13,How long is this gonna take? How long does a washing machine take?
1021,1021,4,Mark,False,11,We're going to be late if we don't leave right away.
1022,1022,4,Mark,False,13,We'll buy you some trousers on the way. We need to leave now!
1023,1023,4,Mark,False,13,"Oh, great. Steal his woman, steal his trousers. You and your wicked willy."
1024,1024,4,Mark,False,11,"Jeremy, you once told me that chairs make you feel horny."
1025,1025,4,Mark,False,15,"Uh-huh, sure. Great, now, there's a minicab place not far from here, we can- What's-?"
1026,1026,4,Mark,False,7,"Well, I am turning the knob, obviously."
1027,1027,4,Mark,False,7,"Well, I am turning it properly Jeremy."
1028,1028,4,Mark,False,6,It's not opening. It's not opening.
1029,1029,4,Mark,True,9,Little bit pleased he didn't manage it with ease.
1030,1030,4,Mark,False,2,Fucking fucklebucks!
1031,1031,4,Mark,False,16,"We can't get back in and we can't get out, we're trapped, Jeremy. We're bloody trapped!"
1032,1032,4,Mark,False,4,That's a debit card.
1033,1033,4,Mark,False,36,"Oh, God! I'm the sort of person who rewinds if I miss a tiny bit of a film, even a film I'm not particularly enjoying, and now I'm gonna miss the whole of my son's christening."
1034,1034,4,Mark,True,40,"All I have in the dad bank is my record of punctuality. Without that, I've got nothing. Come on, Flat B, was it you who so coldly locked us in here to die? Or the security-obsessed wanker in Flat A?"
1035,1035,4,Mark,False,3,Ring Zahra again.
1036,1036,4,Mark,False,31,"Yes, it would, and I'm an idiot, and any attempt I make to escape the debt-driven rat race must be punished immediately, and in the most brutal fashion. OK, happy now?"
1037,1037,4,Mark,False,1,What?
1038,1038,4,Mark,False,9,"I need to make one call, just one call."
1039,1039,4,Mark,False,7,"Hello, Directories? Yeah, Thornton Heath locksmiths, please."
1040,1040,4,Mark,False,8,"They're putting me through, it counts as one."
1041,1041,4,Mark,False,32,"Hello? It's just possible you could save my life. Yeah. I've got myself locked in my flat, if you can believe it. The address? Er, yep, the address. It's, erm, King's Road."
1042,1042,4,Mark,False,7,King's Drive. And the number? The number.
1043,1043,4,Mark,False,4,It's in the fifties.
1044,1044,4,Mark,False,19,"Perhaps you could come to King's Drive and walk up and down, and I'll shout through the letter box?"
1045,1045,4,Mark,False,10,"Forty-two, we're pretty sure we live at forty-two King's Drive."
1046,1046,4,Mark,False,9,"Well, that's customer service. He called me a prong."
1047,1047,4,Mark,False,28,"Yeah, but there's the police or the fire brigade? If we tell one of them, they'll alert the others, 'cause they're all friends. I mean, not friends, but-"
1048,1048,4,Mark,True,13,"I never used to let my battery run down. I miss you, phone."
1049,1049,4,Mark,False,1,Ambulance?
1050,1050,4,Mark,False,7,You can't waste the bar on pizza!
1051,1051,4,Mark,False,2,Don't hold!
1052,1052,4,Mark,True,12,"Look at him, the greedy godfather gobbling pizza on his godson's time."
1053,1053,4,Mark,False,21,"I'm trying to catch the light with my watch face, send out an SOS, Morse code. A passer-by might notice it."
1054,1054,4,Mark,False,1,What?
1055,1055,4,Mark,False,16,"No, I'm not having it in here. If you need to wee, there's the letter box."
1056,1056,4,Mark,False,3,"Well, needs must."
1057,1057,4,Mark,False,14,"Right, I'm going to this christening. I'm gonna bloody well kick the door down."
1058,1058,4,Mark,False,1,Yes.
1059,1059,4,Mark,False,8,Fuck you. I'm not wearing the right shoes.
1060,1060,4,Mark,False,10,"Arrrgh! I am so screwed! I'm so utterly, utterly screwed!"
1061,1061,4,Mark,False,12,"You can't relax! We've got to fight, worry, speculate, tut, pace, swear!"
1062,1062,4,Mark,False,30,"Because it's an emergency! And in an emergency, you watch breaking news, and count your tins of butter beans. You don't sit in the garden and put on Kiss FM."
1063,1063,4,Mark,False,18,We have an obligation to be anxious. It's a mark of respect for the gravity of the situation.
1064,1064,4,Mark,False,4,"Oh, for God's sake!"
1065,1065,4,Mark,False,4,It's a stupid question.
1066,1066,4,Mark,False,17,"Oh, I don't know. I suppose, maybe I could do it, just so long as you didn't..."
1067,1067,4,Mark,False,19,"Enjoy it. I think maybe I could make it through, as long as I knew you weren't enjoying it."
1068,1068,4,Mark,False,6,That is not me all over.
1069,1069,4,Mark,False,5,I'm not getting into that.
1070,1070,4,Mark,False,28,"Jeremy, you could at least try to take this seriously. You are the godfather. What do you think about this, Jeremy? Do you think this is too high?"
1071,1071,4,Mark,False,19,I think I could probably do it. I just need to lower myself the initial portion and then drop.
1072,1072,4,Mark,False,41,"Jeremy, I'm a father. I need to be at my son's christening. I'm not a park bench, White Lightning guy. Besides, after weeks of negotiation, I finally got Sophie to agree to James Ian rather than Ian James, after her dad."
1073,1073,4,Mark,False,1,Hmm.
1074,1074,4,Mark,False,21,Exactly. So I need to make sure she doesn't swerve off-road at the last moment. Do you really think it's impossible?
1075,1075,4,Mark,False,9,You think I couldn't do it but you could?
1076,1076,4,Mark,False,4,"Well, go on, then."
1077,1077,4,Mark,False,2,Why not?
1078,1078,4,Mark,True,14,Could I jump? Might make it easily. More likely splatter like a blood-filled pumpkin.
1079,1079,4,Mark,False,4,You're actually doing it?
1080,1080,4,Mark,False,26,"God, Jeremy! What if someone outside thinks it's some sort of comment? I hope there's no black or minority ethnic person walking past who thinks it's-"
1081,1081,4,Mark,False,16,"I can't open the door, Jeremy. That's one of the key things about this whole situation."
1082,1082,4,Mark,False,10,How's he supposed to deliver it through a locked door?
1083,1083,4,Mark,False,9,"Of course, the letter box. Your new pleasure portal."
1084,1084,4,Mark,False,10,Defeated by your own greed. It's like a Grimms' fairy-tale.
1085,1085,4,Mark,False,6,"Oh, you've got to be joking."
1086,1086,4,Mark,True,14,This is so not how I imagined the day of my first-born son's christening.
1087,1087,4,Mark,False,15,"A slice of bristly cheese-free pizza, lightly brushed in your piss? How can I refuse?"
1088,1088,4,Mark,False,9,"Strangely, there's been very little research into that scenario."
1089,1089,4,Mark,True,9,"Look at him, the James Dyson of pissy pizza."
1090,1090,4,Mark,False,25,"We'll make our fortune. This is a situation millions of people find themselves in every day. There's no name for this situation, it's so unusual!"
1091,1091,4,Mark,True,13,"OK, he's lying. This is interesting. Fine, I'll get the pizza, shall I?"
1092,1092,4,Mark,True,16,"Great, I'm gonna miss the champagne and canapes because I'm working as Jeremy's mad pizza butler."
1093,1093,4,Mark,True,16,"Would actually quite like a slice. But if I ate one, I'd feel like he'd won."
1094,1094,4,Mark,False,1,Thanks!
1095,1095,4,Mark,False,22,"Well, that's great. We're saved, we're rescued! We might even make it to the christening in time. Everything's gonna be all right!"
1096,1096,4,Mark,False,2,Oh? Why?
1097,1097,4,Mark,False,13,Then why did you have such a go at me for being filthy-minded?
1098,1098,4,Mark,False,2,I see.
1099,1099,4,Mark,False,2,It's fine.
1100,1100,4,Mark,False,13,Why don't you try having sex with women who aren't already in relationships?
1101,1101,4,Mark,True,14,"It is quite nice kicking him in his tender nuts, the filthy, filthy bastard."
1102,1102,4,Mark,False,12,"Yes, that has been my view for some time, as it happens."
1103,1103,4,Mark,False,6,"What, now you're actually considering it?"
1104,1104,4,Mark,True,10,"Of course. He's a pathetic worm, just like me, good."
1105,1105,4,Mark,False,16,"Brilliant, hide. You could pretend to be a stuffed beast, or an extremely peculiarly shaped parcel."
1106,1106,4,Mark,False,6,"OK, congratulations, you've found an area."
1107,1107,4,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh?
1108,1108,4,Mark,False,10,"We are not shitting or sleeping in the area, Jeremy."
1109,1109,4,Mark,False,14,"Hmm, didn't get four across, ""boat"", but they aced ""solipsism""? Who was this person?"
1110,1110,4,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
1111,1111,4,Mark,False,8,"Your faith in the bit is touching, Jez."
1112,1112,4,Mark,False,18,"Hold on, Jeremy. I think I might have found a simpler way of doing that, under the bucket."
1113,1113,4,Mark,True,9,"Great, into the flat. Back to square one, whoo-hoo."
1114,1114,4,Mark,False,2,"Right, phone."
1115,1115,4,Mark,False,34,"Jeremy, do you think we could take a brief time-out from the masturbatathon that is your life to go to my son's christening? Right, what's Sophie's mobile number? 07700, that's definitely how it starts."
1116,1116,4,Mark,False,18,"07700, 9-0-0-5-6-3? I think that's right. It's ringing, it's ringing! Hello? It's not her, it was a man."
1117,1117,4,Mark,False,14,Try all the variations of the five or six numbers I'm not sure of?
1118,1118,4,Mark,False,4,Of all the numbers?
1119,1119,4,Mark,False,7,"You really are an imbecile, aren't you?"
1120,1120,4,Mark,False,5,"Well, you're not helping, you're-"
1121,1121,4,Mark,False,1,What?
1122,1122,4,Mark,False,9,"Oh no, Jez no, I don't want to hide."
1123,1123,4,Mark,False,21,"I can't believe I'm doing this. Look, we should just go out there and face up to our responsibilities, like men."
1124,1124,4,Mark,False,11,"I mean, not actually, but we should at least consider it."
1125,1125,4,Mark,False,7,Well how long's that going to take?
1126,1126,4,Mark,False,19,"I dunno, Jeremy. It would have been terribly difficult time, but I would probably have kept my head down."
1127,1127,4,Mark,False,21,"Well that's very easy to say, Jeremy, but you would have risked death, not just for yourself, but for your family."
1128,1128,4,Mark,False,8,"Well, I guess we'll never know for sure."
1129,1129,4,Mark,False,10,"Well, congratulations. You would have been a brave, brave man."
1130,1130,4,Mark,False,4,I can only apologise.
1131,1131,4,Mark,False,7,"OK, we give ourselves up, come clean."
1132,1132,4,Mark,True,2,Bloody hell!
1133,1133,4,Mark,False,3,"Oh, my, God."
1134,1134,4,Mark,False,2,So horrible.
1135,1135,4,Mark,False,9,"OK, right, I've got to get out of here."
1136,1136,4,Mark,False,8,The radio-loving burglar? What if he stabs me?
1137,1137,4,Mark,False,1,Hi.
1138,1138,4,Mark,False,9,The airlock between your flat and the front door.
1139,1139,4,Mark,False,9,Rinse and repeat. Always with the rinse and repeat.
1140,1140,4,Mark,False,21,"Look, I really, really don't want to get into this conversation, I'm missing my son's christening, so if you'll excuse me."
1141,1141,4,Mark,False,18,"No, you're not a bad person, Jez. Zahra's just having a little wobble, it's all gonna be fine."
1142,1142,4,Mark,False,15,"I'm going. I've got to go. I'm really, really sorry, but it's not my fault."
1143,1143,4,Mark,False,8,"Er, yeah, sorry, I've got to go, goodbye."
1144,1144,4,Mark,False,8,"Still locked, double-locked. Can I get the key?"
1145,1145,4,Mark,False,28,"Well, we just feel safe here. There's a lot of prejudices and labels in the world, but here it's a free zone. Now can I get the key?"
1146,1146,4,Mark,False,2,Very well.
1147,1147,4,Mark,False,1,Argh!
1148,1148,4,Mark,False,2,Sort of.
1149,1149,4,Mark,False,4,Hmm. Are you OK?
1150,1150,4,Mark,False,5,I think it was implied.
1151,1151,4,Mark,True,22,"I feel bad when everything's basically fine, while he feels good after enduring the most humiliating day of his life. It's infuriating."
1152,1152,4,Mark,False,5,"Hello, Ian. Sorry we're late."
1153,1153,4,Mark,False,2,"Yes, well."
1154,1154,4,Mark,False,3,It was complicated.
1155,1155,4,Mark,False,5,I know. I was just-
1156,1156,4,Mark,True,2,"Oh, fuck."
1157,1157,4,Mark,False,2,Baby Ian!
1158,1158,4,Mark,True,5,"Mmm. Sweet, delicious, rancid Champagne."
1159,1159,5,Mark,False,6,"Yes, you can come in yet."
1160,1160,5,Mark,False,3,It's in here.
1161,1161,5,Mark,False,32,"Yes, you woke me at five-thirty when you came in. I've been trying to get to sleep since six, by reading about Wilson's trade union reforms, but Marr is so damn readable."
1162,1162,5,Mark,False,4,"Jez, what are you...?"
1163,1163,5,Mark,False,5,What if our feet touch?
1164,1164,5,Mark,False,11,"Wow, wow, Jez, this is lovely. Cognac. Wow, that's my favourite!"
1165,1165,5,Mark,False,10,"In case we get a barbecue, outside, on the... bit."
1166,1166,5,Mark,False,4,Roy Adkins on Trafalgar.
1167,1167,5,Mark,False,6,"Well, that's just tremendously thoughtful, Jeremy."
1168,1168,5,Mark,False,5,"Kitchen tongs, we need them."
1169,1169,5,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, yeah, that's right. You know, in my family we do sort of jokey stockings."
1170,1170,5,Mark,False,5,I might save the rest.
1171,1171,5,Mark,True,13,"It's not fair, that's just aggressive generosity designed to make me feel bad."
1172,1172,5,Mark,False,28,"Cause she's sailing around the Med with Mr. Potato Head, yes, I know, Jez. Oh, wow, so you got it in in the end? It's quite a specimen."
1173,1173,5,Mark,False,7,"Sure. You're not gonna cry, are you?"
1174,1174,5,Mark,False,1,Horny?
1175,1175,5,Mark,False,38,"Now, Sarah. If I scrape together the shortbread from Aberdeen '09 and this unread ""Super Freakonomics"" we can pretend I thought she'd like, even though I'm pretty sure she'll hate it, then that's an acceptable bundle, isn't it?"
1176,1176,5,Mark,False,36,"Well, not really, but the point is, I'm in charge. I've launched the Christmas putsch. I carve the turkey, I decide what veg we have. No cauliflower, no one else has it, it's not a tradition."
1177,1177,5,Mark,False,13,"Exactly. Right, we need to get the oven on for lunch at one."
1178,1178,5,Mark,False,27,"No, Jez, presents after, then charades, then the lull, the Low Countries, then the row, the cold cuts, then bang, into a blockbuster to see ya home."
1179,1179,5,Mark,False,5,"Well, that's what we're doing."
1180,1180,5,Mark,False,4,"Where's the turkey, Jeremy?"
1181,1181,5,Mark,False,5,"The turkey, where's the turkey?"
1182,1182,5,Mark,False,32,"You what? No turkey?! You fucking idiot, Jeremy, you total fucking idiot! That was your job, you fucking moron! You cretin! You're a fuckhead! That's what you are, a fucking shit head!!"
1183,1183,5,Mark,False,4,"Oh I see, oh."
1184,1184,5,Mark,False,15,That looks like a lovely turkey. I'm sorry I flew off the handle a bit.
1185,1185,5,Mark,False,5,"No it wasn't, I apologise."
1186,1186,5,Mark,True,9,"Wow, she's really sweaty. A lovely sweaty Christmas gift."
1187,1187,5,Mark,False,55,"God yeah, the year Dad's British Aerospace shares went kaput, he said we couldn't afford an M&S Christmas pudding, but Mum bought a secret one and steamed it in the garage. We would have got away with it but he smelt it on Sarah's breath and wouldn't talk to us till Boxing Day. God, dads."
1188,1188,5,Mark,False,25,"Oh, wow, thanks, umm... Happy Christmas! It's just a little thing, I did get you another thing, but the stupid thing didn't arrive in time."
1189,1189,5,Mark,False,3,It is gold.
1190,1190,5,Mark,False,3,"Ha ha, exactly."
1191,1191,5,Mark,True,7,"Probably take the gold, then shoot her."
1192,1192,5,Mark,False,7,"Oh, right yeah, the FlashForward box set!"
1193,1193,5,Mark,False,64,"Uh, sure, it's just... we watched all the Losts and they were somewhat OK, and Heroes had some interesting themes, but also quite a lot of not-so-interesting themes, and Prison Break, by the end, I very much felt that I wanted to break out of the prison that Prison Break had become for us. It's just, don't you think maybe we should go out?"
1194,1194,5,Mark,False,10,"To, not the theatre obviously, but the... National Army Museum?"
1195,1195,5,Mark,False,23,"Dobby, where do you see yourself in five years? I mean, for example, would you want to learn sailing at all, or golf?"
1196,1196,5,Mark,True,41,"She is great, but where does it end? With us sailing the Caribbean, checking our pension pot online, or much more likely, trying to scrape a living on pub quiz machines from our vast knowledge of popular culture and bar snacks."
1197,1197,5,Mark,False,1,What?
1198,1198,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, shit."
1199,1199,5,Mark,True,42,"Hmm, should invite her to stay here... and I've missed the moment, right there, missed it. I'm already gonna have a nervous breakdown with my family and Tiny Tim Jeremy and the turkey. Why add a dangerous unstable chemical into the mix?"
1200,1200,5,Mark,True,3,"Oh yeah, two-for-one."
1201,1201,5,Mark,True,14,If I can just get through the next seconds ignoring the mounting social pressure.
1202,1202,5,Mark,True,5,Pressure building to intolerable levels.
1203,1203,5,Mark,False,1,Dobby.
1204,1204,5,Mark,False,6,I assume you're staying for lunch?
1205,1205,5,Mark,False,6,Because I thought it was assumed.
1206,1206,5,Mark,False,2,Jump away.
1207,1207,5,Mark,True,12,"Could lock her in the bathroom. Shit, no lock on the outside."
1208,1208,5,Mark,False,11,"You are putting little crosses in the bottoms, aren't you Jeremy?"
1209,1209,5,Mark,False,12,"Now, obviously this is a fucking disaster, but Dobby's staying, for Christmas."
1210,1210,5,Mark,False,25,"Exactly, ""the more the merrier"", as they said as another poor soul was crammed into the black hole of Calcutta. Jeremy, where are the potatoes?"
1211,1211,5,Mark,False,7,"But, you were on turkey and veg."
1212,1212,5,Mark,False,4,"Um, yes they are."
1213,1213,5,Mark,False,5,Well what else are they?
1214,1214,5,Mark,False,5,"Jeremy, obviously potatoes are vegetables."
1215,1215,5,Mark,False,4,Oh for fuck's sake.
1216,1216,5,Mark,False,7,"Yes, we do have potatoes, two potatoes."
1217,1217,5,Mark,False,19,"Everything's the best bit, according to you. Croissants, Cava, smoked salmon, pineapple rings, having the heating on incredibly high."
1218,1218,5,Mark,False,16,"Yes, everything's absolutely perfect, apart from the fact that Jeremy has forgotten to buy any potatoes."
1219,1219,5,Mark,False,3,"Oh, no need."
1220,1220,5,Mark,True,8,"Yes, a nice standard issue British woman's dress."
1221,1221,5,Mark,False,5,"Welcome back, you look great!"
1222,1222,5,Mark,True,14,"Jeans, for Christmas, at least it's not hot pants and her ironic ""IPood"" t-shirt."
1223,1223,5,Mark,True,15,"Don't break down on Christmas! Break down on Boxing Day, once the washing up's done!"
1224,1224,5,Mark,False,2,Uh huh.
1225,1225,5,Mark,True,10,"Incredibly wasteful peeling technique, but now is not the time."
1226,1226,5,Mark,False,29,"So, er, listen, Dobby, there's something I wanted to tell you. I haven't actually happened to mention to my parents or my sister that I'm engaged in a relationship."
1227,1227,5,Mark,False,25,"Yeah, but it's not like I tell them every tiny detail of my life, and... I was just wondering whether today, with all the madness..."
1228,1228,5,Mark,False,3,"Everything, the carrots."
1229,1229,5,Mark,False,19,I just wondered whether we shouldn't... wouldn't it be simpler just to not tell them that we're going out?
1230,1230,5,Mark,False,6,"I mean, we're still early days."
1231,1231,5,Mark,False,26,"Not like that, but, well it's been such a headache getting them here in the first place, and I don't wanna feed them another shit sandwich."
1232,1232,5,Mark,False,5,"Not you, the whole situation."
1233,1233,5,Mark,True,13,"Oh God, what am I gonna do next, set fire to the tree?"
1234,1234,5,Mark,False,9,"OK, enemy contact, this is it, action stations everyone!"
1235,1235,5,Mark,False,5,"Happy Christmas, one and all!"
1236,1236,5,Mark,False,7,"Of course, the Cava's just through there."
1237,1237,5,Mark,True,11,"Great, five seconds before the first disappointment, got that in early."
1238,1238,5,Mark,False,5,"And you know Jeremy, obviously."
1239,1239,5,Mark,False,5,And this is our... friend.
1240,1240,5,Mark,False,4,We... know each other.
1241,1241,5,Mark,True,20,"It's fine, luckily we're all English, so no one's going to ask any questions. Thank you, centuries of emotional repression."
1242,1242,5,Mark,False,5,"Oh, wow, another one, Mum?"
1243,1243,5,Mark,False,7,Shall we... shall we pull a cracker?
1244,1244,5,Mark,False,4,"OK, sorry, OK, Jeremy."
1245,1245,5,Mark,False,7,"It's OK Dad, the carpet's seen worse."
1246,1246,5,Mark,False,1,Hans?
1247,1247,5,Mark,False,1,Jeremy!
1248,1248,5,Mark,False,2,Well don't.
1249,1249,5,Mark,True,6,"Great, methadone in the mulled wine."
1250,1250,5,Mark,False,3,It's your fault!
1251,1251,5,Mark,False,9,Yes but... you know him. You shouldn't know him.
1252,1252,5,Mark,True,9,"Ugh, merry migraine and a happy new stomach ulcer."
1253,1253,5,Mark,False,2,Architectural salvage.
1254,1254,5,Mark,False,6,He's training to be an architect.
1255,1255,5,Mark,True,4,Don't say fuck off!
1256,1256,5,Mark,True,15,"Oh this is horrible! She's found a way of telling me her true feelings, sneaky!"
1257,1257,5,Mark,False,12,"Oh, socks, nice! Thanks Mum, and they've got a funny... Oh, OK."
1258,1258,5,Mark,True,20,"My mother is giving me socks, depicting a sexual position I have never even attempted. How little she knows me."
1259,1259,5,Mark,True,15,This is the spirit of Christmas. Super Hans bonking Mum doggy-style in the airing cupboard.
1260,1260,5,Mark,False,17,"Wow, this is big, Dad, and heavy. Oh right, I see, yep. Great, yep this is brilliant."
1261,1261,5,Mark,False,8,"It's a shredder, it's my dad's old shredder."
1262,1262,5,Mark,False,2,Like what?
1263,1263,5,Mark,True,3,Please shut up.
1264,1264,5,Mark,True,22,"Why did she have to say? I'm going out with a say-er, the say-ers say they can't help saying, but they can!"
1265,1265,5,Mark,True,21,"This is nice, I think I might bite my tongue off to relieve the tension. Give us something to talk about."
1266,1266,5,Mark,False,16,"It's just resting in the shop, Dad, due to the fact that cauliflower is not traditional."
1267,1267,5,Mark,True,23,"Didn't give him a chance to respond, nice, I should try leaving the room immediately after I say anything to him, much easier."
1268,1268,5,Mark,False,4,"So Jez, how's the-"
1269,1269,5,Mark,False,3,"It's OK, Jez."
1270,1270,5,Mark,True,2,Fashionably rare?
1271,1271,5,Mark,False,7,"Film, three words, Chariots of Fire, next!"
1272,1272,5,Mark,False,6,"Why always Chariots of Fire, Mum?"
1273,1273,5,Mark,False,2,"Mum, really?"
1274,1274,5,Mark,True,26,"Oh God, this is horrible, and the terrible thing is, this is the high point of the day. This is us allegedly having a great time."
1275,1275,5,Mark,True,8,"Oh, the indignity of the public hip thrust."
1276,1276,5,Mark,False,20,"I guess it is time to move to cross-cut. My old strip-cut was probably a security risk, to be honest."
1277,1277,5,Mark,True,5,"Oh, the office equipment homophobe."
1278,1278,5,Mark,True,18,"Not so fast, old man. It's my time to carve, the knife has been passed down the generations."
1279,1279,5,Mark,False,6,"Jeremy, the turkey's not entirely cooked."
1280,1280,5,Mark,False,1,Nothing.
1281,1281,5,Mark,False,12,"Next up, we'll be learning how to inject heroin into our armpits!"
1282,1282,5,Mark,False,1,Yep!
1283,1283,5,Mark,True,14,"Definitely not, truth and reconciliation commission after all this. Full inquiry, Savile, not Hutton."
1284,1284,5,Mark,True,5,Maybe it's gonna be OK.
1285,1285,5,Mark,True,4,"Nope, we are fucked."
1286,1286,5,Mark,False,16,"I know it's not normal, but we could always put the television on while we eat."
1287,1287,5,Mark,False,24,"Mmm, yum, Jeremy may have let us down a bit with the turkey, but I believe he's redeemed himself with this delicious bread sauce."
1288,1288,5,Mark,False,11,"Ratatouille's on in a minute, isn't it meant to be amazing."
1289,1289,5,Mark,False,14,"That wasn't the only present he got you, was it, Dobby, as I recall?"
1290,1290,5,Mark,False,68,"Look, I'm sure Dobby's boyfriend could have strolled into an Argos and got a bog standard bracelet from a spotty Saturday girl, but maybe he wanted to get something a little bit special, something with an inscription, perhaps, as it would make it extra special, but also would unexpectedly delay delivery. That's just one of a number of possibilities, right, so should we all just lay off him?"
1291,1291,5,Mark,True,3,"Fuck you, Poirot!"
1292,1292,5,Mark,False,46,"Look, I'm the bracelet bastard. Dobby's my girlfriend, all right? I'm sorry I didn't mention it before, but we're an item and she's great, and it's going really well, and she may appear to you norms like a bit of a freak, but I don't care."
1293,1293,5,Mark,False,4,"Cauliflower's not traditional, Dad."
1294,1294,5,Mark,True,6,I notice I'm not saying anything.
1295,1295,5,Mark,False,1,Uh...
1296,1296,5,Mark,True,6,Still not saying anything. Nothing coming...
1297,1297,5,Mark,False,1,Dobs!
1298,1298,5,Mark,False,38,"I'm sorry, I can't, they're my parents. Look, stay, I'll grow some balls later, OK? And a backbone. We can have backbone and ball stew all Boxing Day. You can't just leave, what are we gonna tell them?"
1299,1299,5,Mark,True,3,Probably believe it.
1300,1300,5,Mark,False,3,"Oh, well congratulations."
1301,1301,5,Mark,True,13,"God, look at him. He probably thinks Father Christmas died for our sins."
1302,1302,5,Mark,False,2,Dobby's gone.
1303,1303,5,Mark,False,21,"Well, no actually, because she's great and thanks to you, I'm a dick. So I was punching well above my weight."
1304,1304,5,Mark,False,2,Allow me.
1305,1305,5,Mark,True,14,"You want ham, well you're gonna get ham. See how you like this ham!"
1306,1306,5,Mark,False,7,I thought you liked your ham shredded.
1307,1307,5,Mark,False,3,"It's fine, Dad."
1308,1308,5,Mark,True,21,"Uh oh, is Daddy coming to get me? No, I've won, it's festive Festen! Hakuna matata! I'm the new lion king!"
1309,1309,5,Mark,False,8,"Right, Hans, pour my mother a massive drink."
1310,1310,5,Mark,False,4,"Jeremy, turn on Ratatouille."
1311,1311,5,Mark,False,8,"Sarah, crack open the Pictionary. Merry Christ-Mark everyone!"
1312,1312,6,Mark,False,36,"Nothing from Dobby since Christmas. I want to call again, but when I leave long messages, I have this nagging sense that I'll end up hearing them played back to me in a court of law."
1313,1313,6,Mark,False,15,Yeah that would have been more hilarious had I not been literally weeping with fear.
1314,1314,6,Mark,False,39,"Jeremy, all rational people agree it's a truth self-evident that it's impossible to have a good time on New Year's Eve. The pressure's too immense. All I want is to go to Johnson's, find Dobby, and sort everything out."
1315,1315,6,Mark,False,2,"No, Jez."
1316,1316,6,Mark,False,22,The Hitches? You think we're Peter and Christopher Hitchens on a big night out? And I suppose I have to be Peter.
1317,1317,6,Mark,False,13,Fancy dress. It's like a joke for people with no sense of humour.
1318,1318,6,Mark,False,28,"Are you- Has Super Hans been talking about his kibbutz idea again? Cause I can assure you, the State of Israel will not allow a ""kibbutz for hotties""."
1319,1319,6,Mark,False,30,"Oh. Right. Wow. This is very abrupt. It might have been nice to, not take me to the Spaghetti House and buy me a carbonara, but at least... you know."
1320,1320,6,Mark,False,4,"Bada bing, bada bye?"
1321,1321,6,Mark,False,3,"Right, good. Congratulations."
1322,1322,6,Mark,True,15,Wish I'd come as Bond instead of a stupid fisherman from not even a film.
1323,1323,6,Mark,False,9,So are you still pissed off with Big Suze?
1324,1324,6,Mark,False,1,Sorry.
1325,1325,6,Mark,False,3,I don't know.
1326,1326,6,Mark,False,4,"Alan, are you still...?"
1327,1327,6,Mark,False,8,"Thanks, Alan. I'll get stuck into that later."
1328,1328,6,Mark,False,21,I want to keep a clear head for when I talk to Dobby. Do you think she might be here soon?
1329,1329,6,Mark,True,30,"Hmm. He's conned me to his party. 'Cause it's hard to take a legal position on ""might pop in"". Anyone might pop in. Jeffrey Archer, Hugo Chavez, Skinner and Baddiel."
1330,1330,6,Mark,True,11,Your insults are absorbed by the theoretical levity of the costume.
1331,1331,6,Mark,False,9,"You might say that, but I couldn't possibly comment."
1332,1332,6,Mark,False,11,"OK, yes. Yes, yes, I've had my dick in the Dob."
1333,1333,6,Mark,True,5,Just grin and take it.
1334,1334,6,Mark,False,2,I guess.
1335,1335,6,Mark,True,5,Does he want an answer?
1336,1336,6,Mark,False,10,I guess she's more of a manimal than a Flanimal.
1337,1337,6,Mark,False,8,I don't even know what a manimal is.
1338,1338,6,Mark,False,6,Dobby! Wait! Where are you going?
1339,1339,6,Mark,False,16,It was just party chat. I was only being horrible about you to ease things along.
1340,1340,6,Mark,False,11,"Look, I owe you a massive apology for just now, and..."
1341,1341,6,Mark,True,4,is that my baby?
1342,1342,6,Mark,False,4,"and for Christmas, and..."
1343,1343,6,Mark,False,3,I'm sorry. And...
1344,1344,6,Mark,True,7,It bloody is my baby. Is it?
1345,1345,6,Mark,False,6,"Sorry, it's just that I recognise..."
1346,1346,6,Mark,False,3,"No, Dobs, I-"
1347,1347,6,Mark,True,23,My baby. Is that mad? Has he followed me here in a desperate plea for attention? Or am I man-handling a random humanoid?
1348,1348,6,Mark,False,9,He fell out of his basket. I rescued him.
1349,1349,6,Mark,False,25,"What if someone with clogs on had come in out of their face and marched around the room like a horse, or, you know, anything?"
1350,1350,6,Mark,False,8,I'm just saying that the situation looks perilous.
1351,1351,6,Mark,True,28,"Great. Dobby's gone and I'm left with my ex, who despises me, and my son, who probably thinks Jeff's his dad, while I'm just some mad, landlocked fisherman."
1352,1352,6,Mark,True,4,Only if Dobby's here.
1353,1353,6,Mark,False,12,The hunt for punani? I thought you were moving in with Zahra?
1354,1354,6,Mark,False,20,"If Dobby's here, I need to make it up with a gesture, something extraordinary. I could offer to marry her."
1355,1355,6,Mark,False,23,"You told me it was going to be a chilled one, Jeremy. You assured me that he'd made a huge lemon meringue pie."
1356,1356,6,Mark,False,7,Didn't you hear what he just said?
1357,1357,6,Mark,False,6,"No, it doesn't. It sounds terrifying."
1358,1358,6,Mark,False,10,I don't want to go into the heart of darkness!
1359,1359,6,Mark,False,25,"Look, if that party is too much for Hans, the, excuse me, Hans, the crack-addled maniac, I'm pretty confident it'll be too much for me."
1360,1360,6,Mark,False,8,"Hans, is Dobby in there, do you know?"
1361,1361,6,Mark,False,2,Bloody hell.
1362,1362,6,Mark,False,3,How was it?
1363,1363,6,Mark,False,1,What?
1364,1364,6,Mark,False,9,What's going on in there? Are they doing it?
1365,1365,6,Mark,False,6,"Well, what are they doing, then?"
1366,1366,6,Mark,False,2,Big Suze's?
1367,1367,6,Mark,True,6,Great. Super Hans in the sidecar.
1368,1368,6,Mark,False,21,"Hans, we get the message. There's probably no need to list all the things you'd put up bottom for your girlfriend."
1369,1369,6,Mark,True,47,"Can't believe he's actually moving out. I'm going to be an unemployed single mother stuck in the flat, eating Frosties from a salad bowl, until I die from loneliness. And two weeks later they break down the door to find Ian sucking on my cold, dead teats."
1370,1370,6,Mark,False,8,Why? Because you've got your punani jeans on?
1371,1371,6,Mark,False,2,Right. So?
1372,1372,6,Mark,False,22,"Look, just because, for some reason, you associate a chicken drumstick with your penis, doesn't mean that anyone was flirting with you."
1373,1373,6,Mark,False,34,"She gave you some food! When you sneak chunks of my Cathedral City cheddar, is that you taking slices off my dick? So, listen. I'm going to ask Dobby to move in with me."
1374,1374,6,Mark,False,39,"I've been thinking and I need to make the gesture. And you know, maybe this is the kick up the arse we both need. I could turn your room into an office. Finally nail ""Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs""."
1375,1375,6,Mark,False,24,"Exactly. Living together, it's been like eating a vast portion of chips. Very comforting, but also there's this lurking sense you're killing yourself. Right?"
1376,1376,6,Mark,False,2,Eh. Eh.
1377,1377,6,Mark,True,23,"Good luck, Zahra. I hope you know how to add salt to your dishwasher, because Jeremy will never, ever, ever be helping you."
1378,1378,6,Mark,False,11,What should I do if Dobby says no about moving in?
1379,1379,6,Mark,False,6,"Well yes, I suppose I do."
1380,1380,6,Mark,False,1,Smack?
1381,1381,6,Mark,False,1,Really?
1382,1382,6,Mark,False,5,Right? I'm not sure I-
1383,1383,6,Mark,True,10,Huh! He thinks he's Romeo. He's not. He's an armrest.
1384,1384,6,Mark,False,9,"That was a balancing hand, not an erotic hand."
1385,1385,6,Mark,False,1,Yes.
1386,1386,6,Mark,True,15,"If we're going to name his cock after a Clint Eastwood film, it's ""The Unforgiven""."
1387,1387,6,Mark,False,17,"It's fine, Jeremy. Everyone sends an ex the odd... object. It's a natural part of breaking up."
1388,1388,6,Mark,False,3,It's fancy dress.
1389,1389,6,Mark,False,7,"Suze, do you know, is Dobby here?"
1390,1390,6,Mark,True,13,"OK, Dobby. I'm going to find you and I'm going to feed you."
1391,1391,6,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
1392,1392,6,Mark,True,12,Where's Dobby? You aren't Dobby. You aren't Dobby. Even you aren't Dobby.
1393,1393,6,Mark,True,1,Dobby?
1394,1394,6,Mark,True,3,Hello. A lead.
1395,1395,6,Mark,True,23,"Of course. Gerrard's party. I've tracked her down, like Bin Laden in his cave. Now I can move in for the grisly kill!"
1396,1396,6,Mark,True,2,Fuck you.
1397,1397,6,Mark,False,2,Of course!
1398,1398,6,Mark,True,22,"Sure, I'll get it. But the serfs are revolting. I'm storming out of the Winter Palace like the looniest Bolshevik in Petrograd!"
1399,1399,6,Mark,True,2,"Oh, shit."
1400,1400,6,Mark,False,11,"We got waylaid, Alan. We thought we saw a badger and-"
1401,1401,6,Mark,False,8,Isn't it like kryptonite? Won't it kill you?
1402,1402,6,Mark,False,7,I think I have just the place.
1403,1403,6,Mark,False,15,"We actually heard a rumour that The Monkees might be playing. Isn't that right, Jeremy?"
1404,1404,6,Mark,False,3,"Five tickets, please."
1405,1405,6,Mark,False,1,Gerrard.
1406,1406,6,Mark,False,5,"Come on, Gerrard, it's me!"
1407,1407,6,Mark,True,4,It's fine by him.
1408,1408,6,Mark,True,16,The sickly prince has locked Dobby in his castle and the gate's guarded by his troll.
1409,1409,6,Mark,True,2,She's here!
1410,1410,6,Mark,False,1,Dobby!
1411,1411,6,Mark,False,9,"These are surprisingly effective sort of spade-scrapers, aren't they?"
1412,1412,6,Mark,False,6,"Er, just er... just tunnelling in."
1413,1413,6,Mark,False,7,Tracking and digging. Like a faithful hound!
1414,1414,6,Mark,True,8,I'm burying my dignity in this small hole.
1415,1415,6,Mark,True,32,"Oh, my God, she's smiling! She's giving me a hand. She's not shooting me with a sniper rifle. She's helping me tunnel to freedom and start a new life in the West!"
1416,1416,6,Mark,False,10,"Look Dobby, I know tonight I've been a real dick-splash."
1417,1417,6,Mark,True,4,Dick-splash? It's not 1989.
1418,1418,6,Mark,False,22,"But I've had this mad idea, and I don't know, but I just wondered, whether we might have a real mad one..."
1419,1419,6,Mark,True,5,"you, me, and Noel Gallagher"
1420,1420,6,Mark,False,14,"if you... God I feel stupid even saying this, but moved in with me?"
1421,1421,6,Mark,False,7,"Yes, I do. On a long-term basis."
1422,1422,6,Mark,True,14,Here we go. She's gonna rip out my heart like in Temple Of Doom.
1423,1423,6,Mark,True,18,She said yes! I'm moving in with Dobby. I'm king of the world! Must get some new towels.
1424,1424,6,Mark,False,14,"Jez, really not that great in here, man. Are you all right? Where's Zahra?"
1425,1425,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, wow. No?"
1426,1426,6,Mark,False,5,"Yeah. Yeah, Dobby said yes."
1427,1427,6,Mark,False,18,"Look, I'm sure we can sort something out. Make you a bit of a... nest? On the floor?"
1428,1428,6,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, right."
1429,1429,6,Mark,True,7,"God, I'll never be shot of him."
1430,1430,6,Mark,False,2,"Oh, yeah?"
1431,1431,6,Mark,False,9,"Yeah? Hans's second bag? OK, well, if you're sure."
1432,1432,6,Mark,False,3,If you insist.
1433,1433,6,Mark,False,3,"Look, I'd better..."
1434,1434,6,Mark,False,19,He's gonna be fine. He's moving into Super Hans's party pad. They're gonna have the time of their lives.
1435,1435,6,Mark,False,1,OK.
1436,1436,6,Mark,False,14,I think that's just a thing they do. To see in the new year.
