13,13,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, a buddy, you can fuck."
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,11,I mean we're both so relaxed about the whole sex thing.
15,15,1,Jeremy,False,10,Last time I was around there I watched a porno.
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,12,Four in the afternoon - just me and her watching a porno.
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,4,"I mean, that's me."
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,10,I'm not ready for the kind of thing you're after.
19,19,1,Jeremy,False,8,The whole... someone to go to Waitrose with.

36,36,1,Jeremy,False,7,"No, I've been thinking, I'm not sure."
37,37,1,Jeremy,False,5,I think maybe it's shit.
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,8,It's just I found Mark laughing at it.
39,39,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Plus, he was doing it in front of Toni."
40,40,1,Jeremy,False,2,You think?

50,50,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, yeah?"
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Cause the truth is, you're a posh spaz!"
52,52,1,Jeremy,False,16,In the way you're always doing posh spazzy things like tidying up and ironing your socks.

71,71,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, nightmare."
72,72,1,Jeremy,True,8,"Jesus, how did I get trapped with her?"
73,73,1,Jeremy,True,7,She's definitely the most boring person here.
74,74,1,Jeremy,True,25,"I mean they look great, they're probably talking about how they're going to make a real life porn movie with a proper story and everything."
75,75,1,Jeremy,True,5,I could do the music.
76,76,1,Jeremy,False,8,So where do you live in the building?
77,77,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, OK, and what do you do?"

86,86,1,Jeremy,False,7,Turns out I was just someone's secretary!
87,87,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, right whatever."
88,88,1,Jeremy,False,5,We're just popping next door.
89,89,1,Jeremy,False,3,"That's right, yeah."
90,90,1,Jeremy,False,9,I'm taking Paula back to listen to my work.
91,91,1,Jeremy,False,13,She seems like someone who'd appreciate a good track when she heard it.
92,92,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Yes, that's right, I'm going."
93,93,1,Jeremy,False,4,The coast is clear.
94,94,1,Jeremy,False,17,I don't expect you'll get very far but by all means have a pop at the champ.
95,95,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?

100,100,1,Jeremy,True,5,"I mean, I'd have heard."
101,101,1,Jeremy,True,3,Someone would've said.
102,102,1,Jeremy,False,5,Do you really think so?
103,103,1,Jeremy,True,2,What kind?
104,104,1,Jeremy,True,1,Blood?
105,105,1,Jeremy,True,1,Bone?
106,106,1,Jeremy,True,1,Knee?
107,107,1,Jeremy,True,1,Face?
108,108,1,Jeremy,False,1,Great!
109,109,1,Jeremy,False,4,I mean... that's great!
110,110,1,Jeremy,True,1,Shit.
111,111,1,Jeremy,True,4,"Of course, it's who you blow."
112,112,1,Jeremy,False,3,"No, no, sure."
113,113,1,Jeremy,False,4,I know the rules.
114,114,1,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
115,115,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Let's get it on, baby."
116,116,1,Jeremy,True,9,"You're a sunshine coach, bringing a last smile to…"
117,117,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Urgh, if we've got to do this, do you mind keeping the hat on?"
118,118,1,Jeremy,False,3,It's just... sorry.
119,119,1,Jeremy,False,1,No?
120,120,1,Jeremy,False,3,I don't mind.
121,121,1,Jeremy,False,4,I'd just rather not.
122,122,1,Jeremy,False,18,"We could take Polaroids of me, you know, all excited and you could take them away or something."
123,123,1,Jeremy,False,11,"I am very keen to sort you out, so to speak."
124,124,1,Jeremy,False,9,"But on the song, do you really like it?"
125,125,1,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah, I guess you're not in the right frame of mind to..."
126,126,1,Jeremy,True,6,"Don't go on about it, Jesus."
127,127,1,Jeremy,True,6,How much time has she got?
128,128,1,Jeremy,False,1,Maybe.
129,129,1,Jeremy,False,12,"I mean, how long are you planning to stay in your job?"
130,130,1,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
131,131,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Look, should you be doing that?"
132,132,1,Jeremy,False,1,Jesus.
133,133,1,Jeremy,False,7,"You know, I do think you're brave."
134,134,1,Jeremy,False,7,"I just think you're very, very brave."
135,135,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Listen to you, you beautiful crazy thing."
136,136,1,Jeremy,False,4,I meant... the cancer.
137,137,1,Jeremy,False,6,The bloody cancer eating you away!
138,138,1,Jeremy,False,2,Oh yeah!
139,139,1,Jeremy,False,2,Very funny!
140,140,1,Jeremy,False,11,I suppose you think cancer is this huge enormous practical joke!
141,141,1,Jeremy,False,6,"No, no you're quite the guy."
142,142,1,Jeremy,False,18,Certainly not the kind of sicko to ruin someone's music career by suggesting that certain other people have cancer!
143,143,1,Jeremy,False,4,What joke is next?
144,144,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Hey Jez, your mum's dead!"
145,145,1,Jeremy,False,1,Ba-boom!
146,146,1,Jeremy,False,2,Bloody hilarious!
147,147,1,Jeremy,False,23,I'm sure if Kerry was here she'd be rolling round the floor except she couldn't cause she's head to toe in acupuncture needles.
148,148,1,Jeremy,False,4,What's the big deal?
149,149,1,Jeremy,False,10,So I didn't give him the number for Dr Tang.
150,150,1,Jeremy,False,3,She's got leukaemia.
151,151,1,Jeremy,False,18,Sticking a few needles in her face at fifty quid a pop is not going to fix that.
152,152,2,Jeremy,True,5,"Yeah, take that, big Suze."
153,153,2,Jeremy,True,5,Your toilet-seat regime is over.
154,154,2,Jeremy,True,2,"Ah, freedom."
155,155,2,Jeremy,True,3,There he is.
156,156,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Good morning, Mark."
157,157,2,Jeremy,True,6,"Wedge of ballast, then bed again."
158,158,2,Jeremy,True,12,It's a bit like the crusher in Star Wars but red hot.
159,159,2,Jeremy,True,24,What if Mum and Dad were trapped in one and I had a big hook I could swing down to rescue one of them.
160,160,2,Jeremy,True,4,Who would I pick?
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,1,Uh-huh.
162,162,2,Jeremy,True,2,Clerical assistant?
163,163,2,Jeremy,True,6,I can't be a clerical assistant.
164,164,2,Jeremy,True,3,I'm a musician.
165,165,2,Jeremy,True,17,"You wouldn't ask the Chemical Brothers to do your laundry for you, they'd be off their tits."
166,166,2,Jeremy,False,3,Tomorrow at eleven.
167,167,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, sure."
168,168,2,Jeremy,False,4,I'll set the video.
169,169,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Mm-hmm, it's just the music, it's really starting to hot up."
170,170,2,Jeremy,False,28,"Super Hans said he's come up with a bass loop for our new track that is so good that when he tried turning it off, he literally couldn't."
171,171,2,Jeremy,False,6,He actually physically couldn't do it.
172,172,2,Jeremy,False,1,Oh.
173,173,2,Jeremy,False,2,The rent.
174,174,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Don't worry, you'll get your milk."
175,175,2,Jeremy,False,4,This track's a banker.
176,176,2,Jeremy,False,5,Everybody needs their Somethin' Stupid.
177,177,2,Jeremy,False,18,"The guy who wrote that, he's probably up to his neck in penny loafers and blue pool tables."
178,178,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Blimey, what's God up to?"
179,179,2,Jeremy,False,1,Mmm.
180,180,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Uh yeah, cool."
181,181,2,Jeremy,False,4,Have a good one.
182,182,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Bye, mate."
183,183,2,Jeremy,True,2,Tight-fisted cock-muncher.
184,184,2,Jeremy,True,13,"Maybe next time I have breakfast, he'll make me sit a fucking exam."
185,185,2,Jeremy,True,9,Super Hans said he'll be here in twenty minutes.
186,186,2,Jeremy,True,7,Means I've got at least an hour.
187,187,2,Jeremy,True,8,I bet Mark's got some porn here somewhere.
188,188,2,Jeremy,True,4,Mark's got no conception.
189,189,2,Jeremy,True,16,"He thinks I'm so... but really I'm busting my creative balls here, day in, day out."
190,190,2,Jeremy,True,7,"No, but it's all, ""Where's the money?"
191,191,2,Jeremy,True,3,"Where's my rent?"""
192,192,2,Jeremy,True,8,"I mean where's the rent, Mr. Jim Morrison?"
193,193,2,Jeremy,True,2,Mr. Keats?
194,194,2,Jeremy,True,11,"No, you don't like the attack dog, do you, Mr. Keats?"
195,195,2,Jeremy,True,9,Hold on I think I've struck the mother lode!
196,196,2,Jeremy,True,3,Fantasy Figure Modeller.
197,197,2,Jeremy,True,1,Jesus.
198,198,2,Jeremy,True,5,Maybe this is his porn.
199,199,2,Jeremy,True,14,"I'm a dirty hobbit and she's a sexy elf so she might be ""Ohh!"
200,200,2,Jeremy,True,3,You dirty hobbit.
201,201,2,Jeremy,True,7,"Take off my bodkin and my jerkin."""
202,202,2,Jeremy,True,4,"Oh, yeah, pixie ears."
203,203,2,Jeremy,True,3,But that sword.
204,204,2,Jeremy,True,7,What if she was a hobbit slayer?
205,205,2,Jeremy,True,6,I'd just use my enchanted amulet.
206,206,2,Jeremy,True,1,Yeah.
207,207,2,Jeremy,True,4,"Yield to me, hobbit-slayer."
208,208,2,Jeremy,True,6,You will touch my magic cock.
209,209,2,Jeremy,False,2,I dunno.
210,210,2,Jeremy,False,2,It's just...
211,211,2,Jeremy,False,4,I don't like it.
212,212,2,Jeremy,False,3,I just don't.
213,213,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Uh, we are not the Hair Blair Bunch."
214,214,2,Jeremy,False,7,This is the end of Mama's Kumquat.
215,215,2,Jeremy,False,19,"Look, if this is it, if this is John and Paul 1970, then I need money, for the equipment."
216,216,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Look I'm just saying I need money, and…"
217,217,2,Jeremy,False,7,We are not the Hair Blair Bunch!
218,218,2,Jeremy,True,3,"Yeah, perfect plan."
219,219,2,Jeremy,True,13,"I want to fax this off then oh, Toni, I feel incredibly tired."
220,220,2,Jeremy,True,8,Let's just both lie down on your bed.
221,221,2,Jeremy,True,10,"Hope she gets out the bong, not the fucking cafetiere."
222,222,2,Jeremy,False,5,Yeah so I was wondering.
223,223,2,Jeremy,False,7,"You're an urban, switched-on kind of lady."
224,224,2,Jeremy,False,11,"You've probably got a fax machine and all that stuff, right?"
225,225,2,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
226,226,2,Jeremy,False,9,No I was just got this crappy job application.
227,227,2,Jeremy,False,1,What?
228,228,2,Jeremy,False,6,Has Mark been talking to you?
229,229,2,Jeremy,False,4,I don't think so.
230,230,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Well, you're kind of making me say that, but—-"
231,231,2,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
232,232,2,Jeremy,False,1,Good.
233,233,2,Jeremy,False,3,What's pyramid selling?
234,234,2,Jeremy,False,12,"And it's like a big, lovely club with free money for everyone?"
235,235,2,Jeremy,False,6,"I mean it sounds great, but…"
236,236,2,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
237,237,2,Jeremy,False,5,I bet he did it.
238,238,2,Jeremy,False,13,"No, I mean, not because- he was at the garage at the beginning!"
239,239,2,Jeremy,False,13,We already know he's the only one with the key to the lock-up.
240,240,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Well, maybe you should."
241,241,2,Jeremy,False,5,"All right, let God decide."
242,242,2,Jeremy,False,1,Ready?
243,243,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Ah, you see!"
244,244,2,Jeremy,False,9,"He did do it, but for a nice reason."
245,245,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Who's the racist now, Mark?"
246,246,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, fuck!"
247,247,2,Jeremy,False,1,Jesus!
248,248,2,Jeremy,False,4,Maybe it was charming.
249,249,2,Jeremy,False,4,"No, not an oddball."
250,250,2,Jeremy,False,2,A maverick.
251,251,2,Jeremy,False,13,"You may not play by the rules, but by Christ, you get results."
252,252,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Come on, let's go and have a drink, forget about it."
253,253,2,Jeremy,False,8,Have you forgotten about the phone call yet?
254,254,2,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
255,255,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Tell me Mark, how much washing-up do you think you could do without any washing-up liquid?"
256,256,2,Jeremy,False,1,Exactly.
257,257,2,Jeremy,False,9,And what about our friends and neighbours and colleagues?
258,258,2,Jeremy,False,16,"I mean everyone needs cleaning products and that's the one thing that's never gonna change, right?"
259,259,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, that's a very interesting question."
260,260,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Now, the first thing to say would be that this is not pyramid selling."
261,261,2,Jeremy,False,5,"No no, not pyramid selling."
262,262,2,Jeremy,False,14," Listen, listen, it's not pyramid selling, it's network marketing and it's a guaranteed money-making."
263,263,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Mark I've seen the, the charts."
264,264,2,Jeremy,False,8,Are you trying to piss on my bonfire?
265,265,2,Jeremy,False,8,I'm not about to piss all over myself.
266,266,2,Jeremy,False,7,"I'm, I'm pissing into the big time."
267,267,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, I thought…"
268,268,2,Jeremy,False,7,Yeah but if you get in early…
269,269,2,Jeremy,False,1,OK.
270,270,2,Jeremy,True,17,"Oh I'll come to the interview, all right, but I don't think I'll be getting the job."
271,271,2,Jeremy,False,1,Huh-huh.
272,272,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Uh, nothing, just something funny."
273,273,2,Jeremy,False,2,Can you...?
274,274,2,Jeremy,True,4,"OK, here we go."
275,275,2,Jeremy,True,7,Operation 'Come Over Like an Unemployable Freak'.
276,276,2,Jeremy,False,3,Right you are.
277,277,2,Jeremy,False,35,"I might wobble because I'm still a bit pissed from last night you see, and I don't want to get your hopes up 'cause I have to say, I'm only really here because, you know…"
278,278,2,Jeremy,False,1,Mark.
279,279,2,Jeremy,True,2,"Oh, shit."
280,280,2,Jeremy,True,5,Got to be really careful.
281,281,2,Jeremy,True,14,"Don't want to get the job, don't want to piss off the land baron."
282,282,2,Jeremy,True,5,"Shit, what's she talking about?"
283,283,2,Jeremy,True,1,Nod.
284,284,2,Jeremy,True,2,Look serious.
285,285,2,Jeremy,True,4,"I'm Di, she's Bashir."
286,286,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Er, I've done quite a lot, actually."
287,287,2,Jeremy,False,12,"I mean, not formal filing but alphabeti-ba-cising the videos, doing the spices."
288,288,2,Jeremy,False,16,I suppose what I'd want to do is build on that experience in a professional zone.
289,289,2,Jeremy,False,1,Sphere.
290,290,2,Jeremy,False,3,I meant sphere.
291,291,2,Jeremy,True,4,"God, that sounded amazing!"
292,292,2,Jeremy,True,5,Don't accidentally get the bugger.
293,293,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, I suppose it would, actually."
294,294,2,Jeremy,False,7,Although I'm looking for something more relaxing.
295,295,2,Jeremy,False,13,"No, challenging is right, um, but a bit more of a relaxing challenge."
296,296,2,Jeremy,False,8,More like doing a crossword than a tracheotomy.
297,297,2,Jeremy,True,2,"Oh, shit."
298,298,2,Jeremy,True,7,My natural bloody charm's only swinging it.
299,299,2,Jeremy,True,4,Got to do something.
300,300,2,Jeremy,False,6,It's just a thing I have.
301,301,2,Jeremy,False,3,"I do, sometimes."
302,302,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Yes, Barbara."
303,303,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Yes, there is."
304,304,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Barbara, how much washing-up do you think you could do without any washing-up liquid?"
305,305,2,Jeremy,False,5,It's a unique business opportunity.
306,306,2,Jeremy,False,5,"It's not pyramid selling, Mark."
307,307,2,Jeremy,False,5,You're pissing on my bonfire!
308,308,2,Jeremy,False,6,Because you keep pissing on it!
309,309,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Yeah, well, at least I don't fancy elves and pixies."
310,310,3,Jeremy,False,1,Mark!
311,311,3,Jeremy,False,11,You do realize tinned food is just for crackheads and wars.
312,312,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Yeah, it's first pressing, or do you want to wait until everyone else has had their fun with the olives?"
313,313,3,Jeremy,False,13,"Fourth pressing, yeah, like that's going to be a party in your mouth."
314,314,3,Jeremy,False,3,I don't think.
315,315,3,Jeremy,False,1,Mark!
316,316,3,Jeremy,False,3,I'm not shopping.
317,317,3,Jeremy,False,15,I just came here to tell you we've been invited to a very wicked party.
318,318,3,Jeremy,False,7,I did actually but she said no.
319,319,3,Jeremy,False,17,"But it's better this way, two lads, we gotta get out there, grooving, doing it, you know?"
320,320,3,Jeremy,False,9,It's been a long time for either of us.
321,321,3,Jeremy,False,10,"I haven't had my oats in something like, two weeks!"
322,322,3,Jeremy,True,5,Nine months and thirteen days.
323,323,3,Jeremy,False,5,I mean look at us!
324,324,3,Jeremy,False,10,People are gonna think we spend the whole day wanking.
325,325,3,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, man mess."
326,326,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Why do you think they're called ""man size?"""
327,327,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh Mark, come on man, let it go."
328,328,3,Jeremy,False,11,Yeah but what if you want to get Sophie back home?
329,329,3,Jeremy,False,9,You might want to get her all lathered up.
330,330,3,Jeremy,False,1,Shit.
331,331,3,Jeremy,False,2,Did you?
332,332,3,Jeremy,False,2,And she?
333,333,3,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh man I'm... but listen, this is the perfect time to get back in the game."
334,334,3,Jeremy,False,9,"You know, two guys, together, out, looking for... it."
335,335,3,Jeremy,False,7,It's eight o'clock on a Friday night.
336,336,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Most people aren't doing their shopping now, yeah?"
337,337,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Most people are out right now, yeah?"
338,338,3,Jeremy,False,3,"So, safe party."
339,339,3,Jeremy,False,2,Super safe!
340,340,3,Jeremy,True,5,"OK, OK, playing it cool?"
341,341,3,Jeremy,True,13,"All right, how about I go a little Oscar Wilde on your ass?"
342,342,3,Jeremy,False,8,So I always go for the first pressing.
343,343,3,Jeremy,False,15,"I mean why wait until everyone else has had their fun with the olives, right?"
344,344,3,Jeremy,True,3,What's her problem?
345,345,3,Jeremy,True,5,This is the 21st Century.
346,346,3,Jeremy,True,7,Olive oil is a perfectly acceptable topic.
347,347,3,Jeremy,True,3,This is great.
348,348,3,Jeremy,True,5,Knew this would pay off.
349,349,3,Jeremy,True,2,Talking's bullshit.
350,350,3,Jeremy,True,7,"""Yeah, I did this"", ""I go there""."
351,351,3,Jeremy,True,7,"OK, there's a new guy in town."
352,352,3,Jeremy,True,4,Probably just a friend.
353,353,3,Jeremy,True,6,"Yeah, me, her and her friend."
354,354,3,Jeremy,True,3,Quite nice actually.
355,355,3,Jeremy,True,1,Hey!
356,356,3,Jeremy,True,3,That's a foul.
357,357,3,Jeremy,True,1,Fuck!
358,358,3,Jeremy,True,6,"God, she must be loving this."
359,359,3,Jeremy,True,4,I feel so cheap.
360,360,3,Jeremy,True,6,I really thought we had something.
361,361,3,Jeremy,True,7,I can't believe she's snogging him already.
362,362,3,Jeremy,True,4,The dream is over.
363,363,3,Jeremy,True,3,I am detritus.
364,364,3,Jeremy,False,5,We're going to the Lazerbowl?
365,365,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Me, you and Valerie are going to the Lazerbowl?"
366,366,3,Jeremy,False,1,Maybe...
367,367,3,Jeremy,False,5,I could bring someone along?
368,368,3,Jeremy,False,5,"I know, I'll call Toni."
369,369,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah, no, this is perfect cause I'll just say ""Me, Mark and Valerie are off down the Lazerbowl."
370,370,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Do you want a piece of the action?"""
371,371,3,Jeremy,False,6,"and she'll be like ""Hell yeah!"
372,372,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Why the hell not?"""
373,373,3,Jeremy,False,6,"This is mate, we're having it."
374,374,3,Jeremy,False,2,Super nice!
375,375,3,Jeremy,False,2,Do you?
376,376,3,Jeremy,False,6,"Follow the finger, follow the fingers!"
377,377,3,Jeremy,False,4,Are you getting visuals?
378,378,3,Jeremy,False,4,No of course no.
379,379,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Look, everything's going brilliantly, right?"
380,380,3,Jeremy,False,9,Now we've got to work together as a team.
381,381,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Work things up into a bit of a lather, yeah?"
382,382,3,Jeremy,False,3,Follow my lead.
383,383,3,Jeremy,True,12,"I could say we've both got enormous cocks, might be the clincher."
384,384,3,Jeremy,False,3,This is great!
385,385,3,Jeremy,False,2,Isn't it?
386,386,3,Jeremy,False,1,Great.
387,387,3,Jeremy,False,10,"So, girls, what's the weirdest place you've ever... done it?"
388,388,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, right."
389,389,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Valerie, how about you?"
390,390,3,Jeremy,False,6,"OK, so, what's everyone's favourite record?"
391,391,3,Jeremy,True,6,This should be in the bag.
392,392,3,Jeremy,True,13,"She's come to the Lazerbowl with me, why isn't this in the bag?"
393,393,3,Jeremy,True,6,She looks like she hates me.
394,394,3,Jeremy,False,1,What?
395,395,3,Jeremy,False,9,"It's eat as much as you can, you know."
396,396,3,Jeremy,False,6,"At £3.99, I know who's winning."
397,397,3,Jeremy,True,8,"Oh God, please stop talking about Peter Gabriel!"
398,398,3,Jeremy,False,1,Uh-huh
399,399,3,Jeremy,True,32,Maybe I can just really get into Peter Gabriel and go mental and marry her and cut off from society and just have lots of sex and agree with her about everything.
400,400,3,Jeremy,True,4,"Come on, clock's ticking."
401,401,3,Jeremy,True,5,Got to raise my game.
402,402,3,Jeremy,True,2,Think witty.
403,403,3,Jeremy,True,3,Charming and witty.
404,404,3,Jeremy,True,2,And sexy.
405,405,3,Jeremy,False,5,"So, fourth pressing, fifth pressing."
406,406,3,Jeremy,False,4,What's that all about?
407,407,3,Jeremy,False,12,Why wait until everyone else has had their fun with the olives?
408,408,3,Jeremy,True,6,"Oh my God, I knew it."
409,409,3,Jeremy,True,3,Olive oil talk.
410,410,3,Jeremy,True,1,Wicked!
411,411,3,Jeremy,True,6,"Wow, fuck you Lord of Death."
412,412,3,Jeremy,True,7,I'm still full of piss and vinegar.
413,413,3,Jeremy,True,7,"Mmm, doing it with a sexy neighbour."
414,414,3,Jeremy,True,1,Ow!
415,415,3,Jeremy,True,6,That... why is she sucking it?
416,416,3,Jeremy,True,13,Maybe she's practising for my... are you allowed to say when it hurts?
417,417,3,Jeremy,False,1,Oh SHIT!
418,418,3,Jeremy,True,4,Maybe this is good?
419,419,3,Jeremy,True,7,Maybe this kind of turns me on?
420,420,3,Jeremy,False,4,I think maybe I'll…
421,421,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Er, OK."
422,422,3,Jeremy,True,6,This is some sort of test.
423,423,3,Jeremy,True,5,Sort of like The Great Escape.
424,424,3,Jeremy,True,8,"Don't answer in English, just brave it out."
425,425,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, I play the keyboard."
426,426,3,Jeremy,True,16,They're going to use me for a sex game and then burn me in the bath.
427,427,3,Jeremy,False,2,To us.
428,428,3,Jeremy,True,3,"Oh, come on."
429,429,3,Jeremy,True,10,Someone get the carving knife and get it over with.
430,430,3,Jeremy,True,4,Is she going for...?
431,431,3,Jeremy,True,4,But I'm not ready.
432,432,3,Jeremy,True,5,There's no action down there!
433,433,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Look, are you sure this is OK?"
434,434,3,Jeremy,False,5,Isn't Tony going to mind?
435,435,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!"
436,436,3,Jeremy,False,2,Oh God!
437,437,3,Jeremy,False,5,Couldn't we close the door?
438,438,3,Jeremy,False,5,But we've already been caught.
439,439,4,Jeremy,False,6," Super Hans, what are we doing?"
440,440,4,Jeremy,False,5, I don't feel very well.
441,441,4,Jeremy,False,4,Did something bad happen?
442,442,4,Jeremy,False,4, Did I break through?
443,443,4,Jeremy,False,6," But, what was the bad thing?"
444,444,4,Jeremy,True,3,Floss is boss!
445,445,4,Jeremy,True,3,Floss is boss!
446,446,4,Jeremy,False,3,FLOSS IS BOSS!
447,447,4,Jeremy,True,3,"No, not that."
448,448,4,Jeremy,True,2,Something worse.
449,449,4,Jeremy,False,2,What happened?
450,450,4,Jeremy,False,7, I think we need to tidy up.
451,451,4,Jeremy,True,9,"God, I feel like loam, a piece of loam."
452,452,4,Jeremy,True,6,"Jesus, what am I talking about?"
453,453,4,Jeremy,True,5,I wish Mark was here.
454,454,4,Jeremy,True,3,No more drugs.
455,455,4,Jeremy,True,4,I don't need drugs.
456,456,4,Jeremy,True,10,I mean what great music was ever made on drugs?
457,457,4,Jeremy,True,34,"Bowie, obviously, The Floyd, The Prodge, Aphex - the list is endless really, but they could be done twice as fast with half the mess if they just... Ahh, was that the bad thing?"
458,458,4,Jeremy,True,2,Not that.
459,459,4,Jeremy,True,2,Something wrong-er.
460,460,4,Jeremy,True,18,"Heh, Mark will be so pleased when he sees this, he's just so- Maybe I could open my bank statements."
461,461,4,Jeremy,True,7,Maybe you can be boring and cool.
462,462,4,Jeremy,False,3," Hey, you're back!"
463,463,4,Jeremy,False,3,This is great.
464,464,4,Jeremy,False,3,You're really back!
465,465,4,Jeremy,False,8, The El Dude Brothers are back in town!
466,466,4,Jeremy,False,1,Ehhhh!
467,467,4,Jeremy,False,1,Ehhhh!
468,468,4,Jeremy,False,5," Come on in, sit down."
469,469,4,Jeremy,False,6,Tell me all about your trip.
470,470,4,Jeremy,False,9,"I want to hear everything, all the gory details."
471,471,4,Jeremy,False,8,Did you bring back any little tiny soaps?
472,472,4,Jeremy,False,3, Course I am.
473,473,4,Jeremy,False,3,Now you're back.
474,474,4,Jeremy,False,1, Wine?
475,475,4,Jeremy,False,1,Friend?
476,476,4,Jeremy,False,6,But you haven't got a friend.
477,477,4,Jeremy,False,3,Who's you're friend?
478,478,4,Jeremy,True,4,"This is good, yeah."
479,479,4,Jeremy,True,9,I mean three guys sitting around shooting the shit.
480,480,4,Jeremy,True,6,Politics doesn't have to be boring.
481,481,4,Jeremy,True,7,A lot of Moby stuff is political...
482,482,4,Jeremy,True,2,I think?
483,483,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, it's all lies, isn't it?"
484,484,4,Jeremy,False,20,I mean don't tell me Blair wears a suit and tie when he's lounging around at home watching Big Brother.
485,485,4,Jeremy,False,10, What I mean is that they should be more honest.
486,486,4,Jeremy,False,15,"I mean, at least Tony Adams from the IRA, he's like ""Yeah, I shoot people."
487,487,4,Jeremy,False,4,"I like shooting people."""
488,488,4,Jeremy,False,22,"You know, if they were more honest, then maybe people would vote and not switch straight over when the news comes on."
489,489,4,Jeremy,False,1, No!
490,490,4,Jeremy,False,2,"No, sometimes."
491,491,4,Jeremy,False,4,Maybe for a treat.
492,492,4,Jeremy,False,6,"But generally it's great, isn't it?"
493,493,4,Jeremy,False,4,Who do you support?
494,494,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Mark likes Israel, I'm Palestine."
495,495,4,Jeremy,False,9,Makes it more interesting when you pick a... no?
496,496,4,Jeremy,True,3,Oh my God!
497,497,4,Jeremy,True,3,The bad thing!
498,498,4,Jeremy,True,4,That's the bad thing!
499,499,4,Jeremy,False,2,Mega tsunami!
500,500,4,Jeremy,False,5,Can I have a look?
501,501,4,Jeremy,False,1,Oh!
502,502,4,Jeremy,False,2,Oh dear!
503,503,4,Jeremy,False,7,Look what you've... is it all right?
504,504,4,Jeremy,False,3, Yes it was.
505,505,4,Jeremy,False,15,It was working fine and then you spilled your drink on it and it broke.
506,506,4,Jeremy,False,3,That's what happened.
507,507,4,Jeremy,False,4,That's what I saw.
508,508,4,Jeremy,False,1, Hey.
509,509,4,Jeremy,True,4,This could be good.
510,510,4,Jeremy,True,5,Just like the old days.
511,511,4,Jeremy,True,3,Play it cool.
512,512,4,Jeremy,True,5,Don't slag off Johnson... yet.
513,513,4,Jeremy,False,1, Oh!
514,514,4,Jeremy,False,2,Johnson says!
515,515,4,Jeremy,False,2,Johnson says!
516,516,4,Jeremy,False,11,"If you love Johnson that much, why don't you marry him?"
517,517,4,Jeremy,False,6, Why don't you actually screw him?
518,518,4,Jeremy,False,12,"I mean, since you clearly want to do that, why don't you?"
519,519,4,Jeremy,False,10," Oh, just because he's black, I have to like him."
520,520,4,Jeremy,False,2,Do I?
521,521,4,Jeremy,False,5,That's political correctness gone mad!
522,522,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Look, Mark, I'm sorry..."
523,523,4,Jeremy,False,2, You're kidding.
524,524,4,Jeremy,False,4," OK, OK. That's fine."
525,525,4,Jeremy,False,4,I'm fine with that.
526,526,4,Jeremy,False,1,Good.
527,527,4,Jeremy,True,8,"If I keep smiling, maybe he won't leave."
528,528,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Actually, this is a pretty cool place, isn't it?"
529,529,4,Jeremy,False,1,Chopsticks.
530,530,4,Jeremy,False,1,Hmm?
531,531,4,Jeremy,False,7,"These are bit long for me, actually."
532,532,4,Jeremy,False,2, That's better.
533,533,4,Jeremy,False,8,"So, tell me all about the wasabi sauce."
534,534,4,Jeremy,False,1, Yeah?
535,535,4,Jeremy,False,4," Um, I don't know."
536,536,4,Jeremy,False,4,Maybe a few weeks.
537,537,4,Jeremy,False,6,I mean nothing's really decided yet.
538,538,4,Jeremy,False,8," Yeah, or maybe get him a nice watch?"
539,539,4,Jeremy,True,5,This could be all right.
540,540,4,Jeremy,True,10,I'll just get Mark to make us a cleaning rota.
541,541,4,Jeremy,True,7,We'll just stick religiously to the rota.
542,542,4,Jeremy,False,7," Do you think he really wondered, Sting?"
543,543,4,Jeremy,False,7,If the Russians loved their children too?
544,544,4,Jeremy,False,3, I'm not sure.
545,545,4,Jeremy,False,20,"He really seems to be sincerely hoping the Russians love their children too, which I think is a little patronising."
546,546,4,Jeremy,False,4, I could drive you.
547,547,4,Jeremy,False,7," Well, he gave you the keys Mark."
548,548,4,Jeremy,False,24," It's probably some kind of initiative test, you know ""Will you walk like some kind of stupid duck or will you drive like Clarkson?"""
549,549,4,Jeremy,False,2," Oh, right!"
550,550,4,Jeremy,False,5,Suddenly something's going to happen.
551,551,4,Jeremy,False,9,Suddenly I'm going to drive off the non-existent quayside.
552,552,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Listen, I'm insured on my mum's insurance to drive any car."
553,553,4,Jeremy,False,12,"It's freezing out there, Johnson won't mind... if he's a real mate."
554,554,4,Jeremy,False,1, Yes.
555,555,4,Jeremy,True,1,Probably.
556,556,4,Jeremy,True,5,"Who's the Johnson now, huh?"
557,557,4,Jeremy,True,5,"Who's the Johnson now, Johnson?"
558,558,4,Jeremy,False,7,Shall we open her up a bit?
559,559,4,Jeremy,False,6," If it feels good, do it."
560,560,4,Jeremy,False,5,Isn't that Johnson's whole philosophy?
561,561,4,Jeremy,False,2," Ha, haha."
562,562,4,Jeremy,False,4,They love it really.
563,563,4,Jeremy,False,10, Well what do you two do in the car then?
564,564,4,Jeremy,False,16,Don't tell me you just sit around and talk about what the VAT is on cigarillos?
565,565,4,Jeremy,False,5," Hey, I've got an idea."
566,566,4,Jeremy,False,4, This is so right.
567,567,4,Jeremy,False,3, Yes you can.
568,568,4,Jeremy,False,7,All you have to do is believe.
569,569,4,Jeremy,False,3,Driving is bullshit.
570,570,4,Jeremy,False,17," Now just very very slowly take your foot off the clutch and just tickle the accelerator, OK?"
571,571,4,Jeremy,False,7, You're driving... very slowly in first gear.
572,572,4,Jeremy,False,4," That's right, It's easy!"
573,573,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Now, just give it a bit more juice and hang a right."
574,574,4,Jeremy,False,4," Hey, isn't that Sophie?"
575,575,4,Jeremy,False,2, The pedal.
576,576,4,Jeremy,False,2, The pedal.
577,577,4,Jeremy,False,6,"No, no, no, the middle one!"
578,578,4,Jeremy,False,3,The middle one!
579,579,4,Jeremy,False,8," Mate, are you sure you're all right to-?"
580,580,4,Jeremy,False,2," Sure, mate."
581,581,4,Jeremy,False,1,Sure.
582,582,4,Jeremy,False,16,I'll tell Super Hans to move his stuff out cause you're going to be staying now.
583,583,4,Jeremy,True,4,He's grasping at straws.
584,584,4,Jeremy,True,4,Johnson loves that car.
585,585,4,Jeremy,True,5,It's all over for them.
586,586,4,Jeremy,True,12,Might as well get some brownie points by acting the big friend.
587,587,4,Jeremy,False,1,Sure.
588,588,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Sure, mate."
589,589,4,Jeremy,False,11,"If you really, really want me to mate, I'll do it."
590,590,4,Jeremy,False,5,I'll face the firing squad.
591,591,4,Jeremy,False,2, True mates.
592,592,4,Jeremy,False,1,Ehhh!
593,593,4,Jeremy,False,9," Yes, there's a bit of a problem there, actually."
594,594,4,Jeremy,False,20,"You see, I borrowed the keys, drove it around for a bit of a laugh and then I crashed it."
595,595,4,Jeremy,False,2," Yes, ""blimey""."
596,596,4,Jeremy,False,1, What?
597,597,4,Jeremy,False,2,Hold on.
598,598,4,Jeremy,False,2,Aren't you...?
599,599,4,Jeremy,False,2,The car.
600,600,4,Jeremy,False,7,You trusted... you gave the keys to…
601,601,4,Jeremy,True,4,"Shit, he doesn't care."
602,602,4,Jeremy,True,4,Mark's in the clear.
603,603,4,Jeremy,True,9,"It's going to be me and Super Hans, forever!"
604,604,4,Jeremy,False,4,"No, don't go, because..."
605,605,4,Jeremy,False,3,"I'm sorry, Mark."
606,606,4,Jeremy,False,7,I just can't take these lies anymore.
607,607,4,Jeremy,False,5,He smashed up your car.
608,608,4,Jeremy,False,8,"He did it because he hates you, really."
609,609,4,Jeremy,False,3," But, you two?"
610,610,4,Jeremy,False,5,This is never gonna work!
611,611,4,Jeremy,False,4,You don't know him.
612,612,4,Jeremy,False,6,You don't know anything about him!
613,613,4,Jeremy,False,6,How does he like his toast?
614,614,4,Jeremy,False,1,Wrong!
615,615,4,Jeremy,False,12,He likes one brown with Marmite and one white with lime marmalade.
616,616,4,Jeremy,False,3," No, don't go."
617,617,4,Jeremy,False,14,You can't because the truth is he doesn't love you for your business plan.
618,618,4,Jeremy,False,5,He loves you for your...
619,619,4,Jeremy,False,5,He loves you for you.
620,620,4,Jeremy,False,3," Mark's gay, Johnson."
621,621,4,Jeremy,False,4,I can handle that.
622,622,4,Jeremy,False,4,I'm fine with that.
623,623,4,Jeremy,False,2,Are you?
624,624,4,Jeremy,False,8, I think it's best if you go now.
625,625,4,Jeremy,False,3, The bad thing.
626,626,4,Jeremy,False,5,That was the bad thing.
627,627,5,Jeremy,False,10," Man, I am so glad you got me in here."
628,628,5,Jeremy,False,1, Wicked.
629,629,5,Jeremy,False,14,"So, let's go down to the studio and start riffing on some shit, yeah?"
630,630,5,Jeremy,False,4," OK, I get it."
631,631,5,Jeremy,False,3,"The code, right?"
632,632,5,Jeremy,False,19,We bide our time until we pick the perfect moment to start really shaking shit up and get noticed.
633,633,5,Jeremy,False,2, Oh yeah.
634,634,5,Jeremy,False,2,That's Toni's.
635,635,5,Jeremy,False,4,"You know, next-door Toni."
636,636,5,Jeremy,False,6, She's like some kind of drug.
637,637,5,Jeremy,False,8,Kind of like ketamine... but with nicer hair.
638,638,5,Jeremy,False,1, Yeah?
639,639,5,Jeremy,True,6,Shall I ask what he means?
640,640,5,Jeremy,False,40," Yeah, so this really similar to much larger version of the old graphics equaliser that you might have had on your hi-fi, in that it takes the graphics - which is another word for music - and it equalises them."
641,641,5,Jeremy,True,5,"I've lost her, she's gone."
642,642,5,Jeremy,True,12,"Christ, I'm actually quite boring when I put my mind to it."
643,643,5,Jeremy,False,2," Yeah, yeah."
644,644,5,Jeremy,False,2,They're great.
645,645,5,Jeremy,False,3,Really great group.
646,646,5,Jeremy,False,2,Lovely guys.
647,647,5,Jeremy,True,5,"Come on, this is it."
648,648,5,Jeremy,False,13,"So, just sitting here, it's almost like you can feel your mojo expanding."
649,649,5,Jeremy,False,5," No, I don't think it's…"
650,650,5,Jeremy,True,4,"Oh great, they've clicked."
651,651,5,Jeremy,True,1,Brilliant.
652,652,5,Jeremy,True,3,I hear clicking.
653,653,5,Jeremy,False,2, The thing?
654,654,5,Jeremy,False,2, Oh that.
655,655,5,Jeremy,False,3,I fixed that.
656,656,5,Jeremy,False,4," No, I fixed it."
657,657,5,Jeremy,False,1,Twice.
658,658,5,Jeremy,True,2,Fuck off!
659,659,5,Jeremy,False,2,What isn't?
660,660,5,Jeremy,False,8," Listen, I'm just showing Toni around at the…"
661,661,5,Jeremy,True,2,It's cool.
662,662,5,Jeremy,True,5,There's a bond of trust.
663,663,5,Jeremy,True,7,He won't break the bond of trust.
664,664,5,Jeremy,True,6,"She's my guest, I invited her."
665,665,5,Jeremy,True,11,Why should I be the one making Ron lattes all day?
666,666,5,Jeremy,True,5,She'll get bored of him.
667,667,5,Jeremy,True,7,Just like she got bored of me.
668,668,5,Jeremy,False,5," Call yourself a mate, mate?"
669,669,5,Jeremy,False,3," Oh yeah, right."
670,670,5,Jeremy,False,1,"""What?"""
671,671,5,Jeremy,False,8,I saw you leave her flat this morning.
672,672,5,Jeremy,False,5, She hasn't got a bongo.
673,673,5,Jeremy,False,5,You weren't carrying a bon...
674,674,5,Jeremy,False,4,There was no bongo!
675,675,5,Jeremy,False,2," Look, mate."
676,676,5,Jeremy,False,3,I'm next door.
677,677,5,Jeremy,False,3,I heard you.
678,678,5,Jeremy,False,4,Your... noise last night.
679,679,5,Jeremy,False,12," Yeah, well you certainly seemed to enjoy the last few... a lot."
680,680,5,Jeremy,True,1,Uh-oh!
681,681,5,Jeremy,True,5,It's the human time bomb.
682,682,5,Jeremy,True,3,Don't poke him.
683,683,5,Jeremy,True,3,Don't rile him.
684,684,5,Jeremy,False,5," Hey man, how you doing?"
685,685,5,Jeremy,False,4,Good to see you.
686,686,5,Jeremy,False,3,Join the party.
687,687,5,Jeremy,False,7,We're just hanging out with the band.
688,688,5,Jeremy,False,5,Long day at the studio.
689,689,5,Jeremy,False,4,"So, how you doing?"
690,690,5,Jeremy,False,1, Great.
691,691,5,Jeremy,True,13,They don't know that I am the owner of a massive musical brain.
692,692,5,Jeremy,True,7,"To them, I'm just the mild-mannered janitor."
693,693,5,Jeremy,True,5,"Yeah, the chorus is working."
694,694,5,Jeremy,True,4,Like the frog chorus.
695,695,5,Jeremy,True,5,Someone needs to tell them.
696,696,5,Jeremy,True,8,I'm an outsider but I'm on the inside.
697,697,5,Jeremy,True,3,This is it.
698,698,5,Jeremy,True,4,This is my moment.
699,699,5,Jeremy,True,4,"Go on, do it."
700,700,5,Jeremy,True,6,"Cross the drawbridge, make the splash."
701,701,5,Jeremy,False,9,Maybe you should just mess things up a bit?
702,702,5,Jeremy,False,17," I mean, don't you think it'd be better if the sound was more sort of like Ka-ZOW?!"
703,703,5,Jeremy,False,1,!
704,704,5,Jeremy,False,24," Not so much A to B to C, but more sort of A to D and then back to A and then to X!"
705,705,5,Jeremy,False,4,"You know, just better."
706,706,5,Jeremy,False,4,Like your first CD.
707,707,5,Jeremy,False,9,"I mean, obviously I don't want to butt in."
708,708,5,Jeremy,False,5,I mean It's your song.
709,709,5,Jeremy,False,13,"Cos like I say, at the moment it is very sort of ""duh-duh-duh-duh."
710,710,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, God, we're doing the fucking song."
711,711,5,Jeremy,False,4,When's it gonna finish?
712,712,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Fucking hell."""
713,713,5,Jeremy,False,8,Whereas I'm thinking it should be more do-do-do-do-do-wa-wa!
714,714,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Whereas, like I say, at the moment it is more kind of..."
715,715,5,Jeremy,False,6,Which it doesn't have to be.
716,716,5,Jeremy,False,3," No problem, mate."
717,717,5,Jeremy,True,6,This was definitely a good idea.
718,718,5,Jeremy,True,8,There's no chance this wasn't a good idea.
719,719,5,Jeremy,False,1, Fired?
720,720,5,Jeremy,False,1,But…
721,721,5,Jeremy,False,1, What?
722,722,5,Jeremy,False,4,You didn't do shit.
723,723,5,Jeremy,False,7," Right, so are you gonna walk now?"
724,724,5,Jeremy,False,4, That's pretty bloody obvious.
725,725,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, I refuse."
726,726,5,Jeremy,False,3,I'm not going.
727,727,5,Jeremy,False,8,So what are you gonna do about that?
728,728,5,Jeremy,False,5,"I'm still here, Super Hans."
729,729,5,Jeremy,False,4,I'm still standing here.
730,730,5,Jeremy,False,2,You lose.
731,731,5,Jeremy,False,4, I see through you.
732,732,5,Jeremy,False,13,Trying to get me out so you can muscle in on my woman.
733,733,5,Jeremy,False,12, Wouldn't it be so much easier if I just lay down and…
734,734,5,Jeremy,False,2,OK Ron.
735,735,5,Jeremy,False,14,"No, that won't be necessary because I'm going to be leaving the premises immediately."
736,736,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Thank you, Ron."
737,737,5,Jeremy,False,9," You see, he's not Lennon, but she is Yoko."
738,738,5,Jeremy,False,9,I'm Lennon but Yoko has gone off with Paul.
739,739,5,Jeremy,False,4,"I mean, imagine that."
740,740,5,Jeremy,False,5,That's the scenario we're talking.
741,741,5,Jeremy,False,7,Don't they mind you not going in?
742,742,5,Jeremy,False,22," Yeah, I mean, what's wrong with revenge, and the mark on the door, and plagues and pestilence and that kind of thing?"
743,743,5,Jeremy,False,7, Suddenly you're not allowed to wreak revenge?
744,744,5,Jeremy,False,2," Yeah, sure."
745,745,5,Jeremy,False,5,No one suspects the chef.
746,746,5,Jeremy,False,2," OK, right."
747,747,5,Jeremy,False,6,And what happens in the end?
748,748,5,Jeremy,False,2," Yes, sir-ee."
749,749,5,Jeremy,False,3,It's payback time.
750,750,5,Jeremy,False,7,And she's paying back in fear dollars.
751,751,5,Jeremy,False,16, I thought I might just say I'm gonna cut her up and leave her in buckets.
752,752,5,Jeremy,False,5, What shall I say then?
753,753,5,Jeremy,False,2,Shall I…
754,754,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, hello?"
755,755,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Er, it's, I'm..."
756,756,5,Jeremy,False,3,I'm watching you.
757,757,5,Jeremy,False,10,"Not in a horrible way, just I can see you."
758,758,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Yes, I can."
759,759,5,Jeremy,False,3,You're eating spaghetti.
760,760,5,Jeremy,False,1,Linguine.
761,761,5,Jeremy,False,1,Whatever.
762,762,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, I'm outside."
763,763,5,Jeremy,False,4,I'm behind a bush.
764,764,5,Jeremy,False,37,"No, I'm not gonna tell you which... now look, I'm the one in charge here, I'm the one... now look there's no need to go over the top about this, I'm just shitting you up a bit."
765,765,5,Jeremy,False,2," Sophie, I...!"
766,766,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Mark, she's going to..."
767,767,5,Jeremy,False,5," She's coming, we've got to…"
768,768,5,Jeremy,False,6, It's lucky you had those boots.
769,769,5,Jeremy,False,7," Yeah, I think she got the message."
770,770,5,Jeremy,False,6," So, you still up for this?"
771,771,5,Jeremy,False,2," Great, good."
772,772,5,Jeremy,False,5,Give me the plan again.
773,773,5,Jeremy,False,3, That's the spirit.
774,774,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Go for it, buddy."
775,775,5,Jeremy,False,5, What the hell's going on?
776,776,5,Jeremy,False,5,Why haven't you pepper-sprayed him?
777,777,5,Jeremy,False,11," Er, I am not Jeremy, I am... Oh, lookee lookee at this!"
778,778,5,Jeremy,False,4,Well what a surprise!
779,779,5,Jeremy,False,5,What a very big surprise!
780,780,5,Jeremy,False,4,Another late-night bongo lesson?
781,781,5,Jeremy,False,7," OK, yeah mate, I'll make a move."
782,782,5,Jeremy,False,6,How about this for a move?
783,783,5,Jeremy,False,1,Fuck!
784,784,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, you sprayed me!"
785,785,5,Jeremy,False,4,You fucking sprayed me!
786,786,5,Jeremy,False,10, How could it possibly have been for my own good?
787,787,5,Jeremy,False,3, Where is it?
788,788,5,Jeremy,False,6,Just tell me where it is.
789,789,5,Jeremy,False,2," Yeah, whatever."
790,790,5,Jeremy,False,5,He shouldn't have pepper-sprayed me.
791,791,5,Jeremy,False,5," Hey, Mark, I found it."
792,792,5,Jeremy,False,5,It's for your own good.
793,793,6,Jeremy,False,1, Uh-huh.
794,794,6,Jeremy,False,2," Mmm, yeah."
795,795,6,Jeremy,False,2," Oh, fine."
796,796,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Kind of weird, Mum rang to say that my Uncle Ray is a bit ill."
797,797,6,Jeremy,False,1, Dunno.
798,798,6,Jeremy,False,12,"He's gone into the hospice, so I guess he's being looked after."
799,799,6,Jeremy,False,5, Like a hospital but nicer.
800,800,6,Jeremy,False,2," Oh, right."
801,801,6,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah, Mum said he was... what you said."
802,802,6,Jeremy,False,5,I'm sure he'll be fine.
803,803,6,Jeremy,False,4,He's not a quitter.
804,804,6,Jeremy,False,4," No, he won't quit."
805,805,6,Jeremy,False,7,Do you know what I fancy now?
806,806,6,Jeremy,False,3,Some Good Life.
807,807,6,Jeremy,False,4,Where's more Good Life?
808,808,6,Jeremy,False,1, Ray?
809,809,6,Jeremy,False,1,No.
810,810,6,Jeremy,False,1,No.
811,811,6,Jeremy,False,9,He's probably got people calling him night and day.
812,812,6,Jeremy,False,5,He's probably sick of it.
813,813,6,Jeremy,False,12,I thought probably best just to give him some peace and quiet.
814,814,6,Jeremy,False,6," Good to see you, Uncle Ray."
815,815,6,Jeremy,False,5,What you been up to?
816,816,6,Jeremy,False,1, Right.
817,817,6,Jeremy,False,1,Cool.
818,818,6,Jeremy,True,7,"Jesus, that wasn't a very friendly joke."
819,819,6,Jeremy,True,4,At least I came.
820,820,6,Jeremy,True,2,What's this?
821,821,6,Jeremy,True,7,This is meant to be my visit.
822,822,6,Jeremy,True,4,He's hijacking my visit.
823,823,6,Jeremy,True,4,"Come on, say something."
824,824,6,Jeremy,True,4,Something not about dying.
825,825,6,Jeremy,True,2,Something inspiring.
826,826,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
827,827,6,Jeremy,False,1, Yeah.
828,828,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, yeah."
829,829,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
830,830,6,Jeremy,True,2,That's nice.
831,831,6,Jeremy,True,5,Ray's such a nice guy.
832,832,6,Jeremy,True,9,What a shame everything he believes is total rubbish.
833,833,6,Jeremy,False,6," OK, well, thanks for calling, Mum."
834,834,6,Jeremy,False,3,"OK, I will."
835,835,6,Jeremy,False,1,Bye.
836,836,6,Jeremy,False,2, Ray's dead.
837,837,6,Jeremy,False,2, Uncle Ray.
838,838,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Football, ciggies."
839,839,6,Jeremy,False,16,He was gonna make me a bow and arrow that could go through a metal dustbin.
840,840,6,Jeremy,False,7,"He never did, of course but, wow."
841,841,6,Jeremy,False,1, Yeah.
842,842,6,Jeremy,False,5,Maybe some Newsnight or something.
843,843,6,Jeremy,False,10," I mean, I wish maybe the family could come together."
844,844,6,Jeremy,False,7,"We could campaign, against, or for something."
845,845,6,Jeremy,False,3,Maybe a foundation.
846,846,6,Jeremy,False,7,"The Ray Foundation, for Christians and coppers."
847,847,6,Jeremy,False,9, Something positive's got to come out of all this.
848,848,6,Jeremy,False,1,Something.
849,849,6,Jeremy,False,9,I guess I just need some comfort right now.
850,850,6,Jeremy,False,8,"I mean, why does it have to happen?"
851,851,6,Jeremy,False,4,Why does death happen?
852,852,6,Jeremy,True,23,"Oh, this is pretty low, milking Uncle Ray to get a... hey, I'm feeling bad, why not get some nooky out of it?"
853,853,6,Jeremy,False,7,"I just feel so alone, you know?"
854,854,6,Jeremy,False,4," Right, but Toni maybe..."
855,855,6,Jeremy,False,1, Go?
856,856,6,Jeremy,False,12,"But Toni, I really feel that tonight, I just need someone to-"
857,857,6,Jeremy,True,18,I can't believe she would be this heartless to someone who's as upset as I say I am.
858,858,6,Jeremy,True,18,"Maybe I am as upset as I say I am, it's just coming out in a weird way."
859,859,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Toni, listen, nothing could make me feel better about Ray's death."
860,860,6,Jeremy,False,7,Except maybe one thing could make me feel better.
861,861,6,Jeremy,False,1, Right.
862,862,6,Jeremy,True,11,God I'm so pleased we stopped going to Liz's for Christmas.
863,863,6,Jeremy,True,8,"Oh thanks for the fair-trade nuts again, Auntie."
864,864,6,Jeremy,True,3,She's loving this.
865,865,6,Jeremy,True,3,What a stitch-up.
866,866,6,Jeremy,True,2,Words coming…
867,867,6,Jeremy,False,7,I'm gonna blow this gaff wide open.
868,868,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, yeah."
869,869,6,Jeremy,False,9,I spent some time with Ray before he went.
870,870,6,Jeremy,False,22,"And I just wanted to say that, um, I think we should all remember that Ray, by the end, he loved Jesus."
871,871,6,Jeremy,False,29,"Now, I know, Liz, there's no proof for Jesus, but then there's no proof for lots of things like science or the stock market, and we believe in them."
872,872,6,Jeremy,False,92,"Look, what I'm trying to say is that, if I was dying, and I decided that even though I'd never particularly been into, say uh... Enya before, but that now I really, really was into Enya and that in fact I thought Enya was great, and that Enya died for our sins and I wanted an Enya-themed funeral with pictures of Enya and lots and lots of mentions of... Enya, then I think it would be a bit bloody rich for my sister to ban all mention of Enya from my funeral."
873,873,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
874,874,6,Jeremy,False,13," Yeah, I guess it just came from in here, or maybe - up there?"
875,875,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
876,876,6,Jeremy,False,3,Here's to God!
877,877,6,Jeremy,True,3,Yep that's God.
878,878,6,Jeremy,True,15,"You think you're in, and then the smiting, and the plagues and the pestilence starts."
879,879,6,Jeremy,True,5,"Shit, I can't believe it."
880,880,6,Jeremy,False,3, So have I.
881,881,6,Jeremy,False,3, The hospital called.
882,882,6,Jeremy,False,8,"What Ray died of, Boden-Georgeson syndrome, it's hereditary."
883,883,6,Jeremy,False,4, I might have it.
884,884,6,Jeremy,False,8,They want me to go in for tests.
885,885,6,Jeremy,False,1, Yeah.
886,886,6,Jeremy,False,1,No.
887,887,6,Jeremy,False,5,"To be honest, I'm scared."
888,888,6,Jeremy,False,3, I am scared.
889,889,6,Jeremy,False,3, I am scared.
890,890,6,Jeremy,True,5,"""Abandon self-cherishing, love only others."""
891,891,6,Jeremy,True,20,"Yeah, well, Mr. Dalai Lama, I suppose you've got to be a suck-up if you haven't got your own country."
892,892,6,Jeremy,True,3,"OK, stay focused."
893,893,6,Jeremy,True,15,"Don't have to do them all, just till you find something to hold on to."
894,894,6,Jeremy,True,4,"Let's see, let's prioritise."
895,895,6,Jeremy,True,1,Islam.
896,896,6,Jeremy,True,6,Not really such a fashionable religion.
897,897,6,Jeremy,True,1,Hinduism?
898,898,6,Jeremy,True,5,That's got a nice vibe.
899,899,6,Jeremy,True,7,Find out the Hin-do's and the Hin-don'ts.
900,900,6,Jeremy,True,3,Good old Bible.
901,901,6,Jeremy,True,9,"Bit ""dribble not the ass's milk on a Tuesday""."
902,902,6,Jeremy,True,9,"Anyway, I know most of that from The Omen."
903,903,6,Jeremy,False,1, Uh-huh.
904,904,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, have a good time, mate."
905,905,6,Jeremy,True,22,"On the other hand I could finish off the last of that skunk, sit on Big Suze's dildo and wank myself dry."
906,906,6,Jeremy,True,13,I could go down that place Super Hans says is a knocking shop.
907,907,6,Jeremy,True,12,"If it's not, bang a tab and get a four hour massage."
908,908,6,Jeremy,False,1, Yeah?
909,909,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, I kind of had plans."
910,910,6,Jeremy,True,9," No point, I've got that taped, it's all bullshit."
911,911,6,Jeremy,True,8,"God, he really really wants me to come."
912,912,6,Jeremy,False,4," Uh, well, all right."
913,913,6,Jeremy,False,8,"I guess, if you really want me to."
914,914,6,Jeremy,True,10,"God, I didn't realise he was this terrified of sex.)"
915,915,6,Jeremy,False,2," Uh, whatever."
916,916,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Carry on, I just want to rewind this bit."
917,917,6,Jeremy,False,19," Mark, I gave you the choice, it's either Tom and Barbara being nice or Gloria and Mitzy being nasty."
918,918,6,Jeremy,False,2," Fine, whatever."
919,919,6,Jeremy,False,18,Can't you get it into your tiny closed-off little mind that I just don't give a flying fuck?
920,920,6,Jeremy,False,6, Blah blah blah blah blah Mark!
921,921,6,Jeremy,False,3,Nothing means anything!
922,922,6,Jeremy,False,7,"It's all just shit, the whole thing!"
923,923,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Games, snacks, fires, man, woman, love."
924,924,6,Jeremy,False,17,"'Cause we're all gonna end up in the cold, deep ground, and that's all there is, OK?"
925,925,6,Jeremy,True,7,"Oh, what I really want's a woman."
926,926,6,Jeremy,True,12,"Oh God, I'm never gonna have a woman again in my life."
927,927,6,Jeremy,True,5,I never planted my seed.
928,928,6,Jeremy,True,6,My loins are like dried buckwheat.
929,929,6,Jeremy,True,3,It's not fair.
930,930,6,Jeremy,False,2," Uh, thanks."
931,931,6,Jeremy,False,8," Uh, Sophie, could I have a quick word?"
932,932,6,Jeremy,False,2,In private.
933,933,6,Jeremy,False,2," Well, yeah."
934,934,6,Jeremy,False,4," Oh, go on Soph."
935,935,6,Jeremy,False,11,This could be the last time I do it with anyone.
936,936,6,Jeremy,False,7,Can you imagine how committed I'd be?
937,937,6,Jeremy,False,4, Mark doesn't love you.
938,938,6,Jeremy,False,5,He doesn't even like you.
939,939,6,Jeremy,False,10, He... he said he's only snogging you for a joke.
940,940,6,Jeremy,False,21,"And he draws horrible, vicious cartoons of you and then wraps them up in sausage meat and calls you a sausage-muncher."
941,941,6,Jeremy,False,2, Go on!
942,942,6,Jeremy,False,7,I might be dead in a week!
943,943,6,Jeremy,False,4, What about a three's-up?
944,944,6,Jeremy,False,7," All right, OK, I get the message."
945,945,6,Jeremy,False,1,Oh!
946,946,6,Jeremy,False,5,"It's like that, is it?!"
947,947,6,Jeremy,False,8,"That's how it's going to be, is it?"
948,948,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, excuse me!"
949,949,6,Jeremy,False,2, Huh... what?
950,950,6,Jeremy,False,1, What?
951,951,6,Jeremy,False,3,What's going on?
952,952,6,Jeremy,False,1, Pills?
953,953,6,Jeremy,False,3,Just the one.
954,954,6,Jeremy,False,6," Yeah, it was the last one."
955,955,6,Jeremy,False,4,I had a headache.
956,956,6,Jeremy,False,6,I- has anyone got any Coke?
957,957,6,Jeremy,False,3,My mouth's all-
958,958,6,Jeremy,False,7," I've been feeling very low, you know?"
959,959,6,Jeremy,False,1, Yeah.
960,960,6,Jeremy,False,4,I was feeling desperate.
961,961,6,Jeremy,False,4,"I mean, that's why."
962,962,6,Jeremy,False,6,That's why I took the overdose.
963,963,6,Jeremy,False,4, I couldn't admit it.
964,964,6,Jeremy,False,7,"I was ashamed but, I did it."
965,965,6,Jeremy,False,10,"The bottle was full, I- I took the whole lot."
966,966,6,Jeremy,False,1, What?
967,967,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Uh, no actually, look I admit it, I was joking."
968,968,6,Jeremy,False,7,"I was lying just then, not before."
969,969,6,Jeremy,False,11,"I didn't take an overdose, you can put away the hardware."
970,970,6,Jeremy,False,11,I didn't do anything I was lying just then not before.
971,971,6,Jeremy,False,3,Don't pump me!
972,972,6,Jeremy,False,3,Don't pump me!
973,973,6,Jeremy,False,1,!
974,974,6,Jeremy,False,8," So I, uh- I got the test results."
975,975,6,Jeremy,False,2,It's positive.
976,976,6,Jeremy,False,3,Are you OK?
977,977,6,Jeremy,False,2, Uh huh.
978,978,6,Jeremy,False,1,Mmm-hmm.
979,979,6,Jeremy,False,3, Three to six.
980,980,6,Jeremy,True,5,I'll say miracle drug cure.
981,981,6,Jeremy,True,8,Maybe she'll give me another one as congratulations.
982,982,6,Jeremy,True,8,"Oh God, hope she doesn't start crying again."
983,983,6,Jeremy,True,6,Got to- before she- come on.
984,984,6,Jeremy,True,14,"Oh, I am gonna feel so low just as soon as this is over."
985,985,1,Mark,True,6,"She's on there, she's on there."
986,986,1,Mark,True,7,Got to get the same bus home.
987,987,1,Mark,True,2,Don't go!
988,988,1,Mark,True,2,Almost there.
989,989,1,Mark,True,10,"Yes, I am the lord of the bus, said he!"
990,990,1,Mark,True,3,Where is she?
991,991,1,Mark,True,1,Knickers!
992,992,1,Mark,True,4,She's not on here.
993,993,1,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
994,994,1,Mark,False,3,I was running.
995,995,1,Mark,False,3,Were you running?
996,996,1,Mark,False,4,"Of course, stupid music."
997,997,1,Mark,False,3,Why don't you?
998,998,1,Mark,True,3,"Oh no, shit!"
999,999,1,Mark,True,1,She's...
1000,1000,1,Mark,True,3,I should say.
1001,1001,1,Mark,True,3,"No, too late."
1002,1002,1,Mark,True,4,Already it's too late.
1003,1003,1,Mark,True,17,"Maybe if we hit a bump I can slip it out, or keep schtum, ride it out."
1004,1004,1,Mark,True,9,"Gonna need to waggle eventually, keep the circulation going"
1005,1005,1,Mark,False,10,"Oh, I was going to say, but I just, sorry."
1006,1006,1,Mark,True,7,"Of course, she's giving you the book-off."
1007,1007,1,Mark,True,9,"Women don't want your hand under their bottoms, Mark."
1008,1008,1,Mark,True,3,That's been established.
1009,1009,1,Mark,True,3,That's a given.
1010,1010,1,Mark,True,9,"""She sat on it officer, it was an accident."""
1011,1011,1,Mark,True,10,"""Of course it was, now get in with the nonces."""
1012,1012,1,Mark,True,3,What a disaster
1013,1013,1,Mark,True,12,"They're going to trap me, and their brothers will hack me to"
1014,1014,1,Mark,False,4,"Here, look, you can"
1015,1015,1,Mark,True,4,You're not a paedo.
1016,1016,1,Mark,True,5,You're definitely not a paedo.
1017,1017,1,Mark,True,12,Those kids have no idea whatsoever of what went on at Stalingrad.
1018,1018,1,Mark,True,25,"Although I can in no way compare my struggle of reading it with that of the Red Army, it has been a very big read."
1019,1019,1,Mark,True,1,Pfftt.
1020,1020,1,Mark,True,9,That's exactly the opposite of what I'm looking for.
1021,1021,1,Mark,False,2,Hey man.
1022,1022,1,Mark,False,1,Shit.
1023,1023,1,Mark,False,1,Oh!
1024,1024,1,Mark,False,2,A party?
1025,1025,1,Mark,False,7,"Did you, you know, make your move?"
1026,1026,1,Mark,False,2,Fuck buddy?
1027,1027,1,Mark,False,3,Yeah I suppose.
1028,1028,1,Mark,True,7,I don't want to go to Waitrose.
1029,1029,1,Mark,True,5,I want a fuck buddy.
1030,1030,1,Mark,False,1,Depends.
1031,1031,1,Mark,False,7,"So, which Starbucks does she go to?"
1032,1032,1,Mark,True,4,"Come on, come on."
1033,1033,1,Mark,True,2,Piss off.
1034,1034,1,Mark,True,7,I want to go to the shop.
1035,1035,1,Mark,True,8,"Need a poo, got to have loo paper."
1036,1036,1,Mark,True,13,I should be able to just walk out of my own front door.
1037,1037,1,Mark,True,4,What's wrong with me?
1038,1038,1,Mark,True,13,Would be great if a car just ploughed into the lot of them.
1039,1039,1,Mark,True,3,"Twisted, broken bones."
1040,1040,1,Mark,False,4,"Hi Toni, I'm fine."
1041,1041,1,Mark,False,22,"I was just checking the letterbox for... sometimes they get stuck in there and the next thing you know, your phone's cut off."
1042,1042,1,Mark,False,1,No?
1043,1043,1,Mark,False,7,"Oh right, that is a bit crap."
1044,1044,1,Mark,False,3,I don't know.
1045,1045,1,Mark,True,2,Go on.
1046,1046,1,Mark,False,3,I've got Alpen!
1047,1047,1,Mark,False,7,"Yeah, I mean... you could, have some."
1048,1048,1,Mark,True,4,What are you doing?
1049,1049,1,Mark,True,4,What about the poo?
1050,1050,1,Mark,True,7,If I can just hold it in...
1051,1051,1,Mark,True,4,I think it's retreating.
1052,1052,1,Mark,False,5,"So, here we are then."
1053,1053,1,Mark,False,3,Bowl o' Alpen.
1054,1054,1,Mark,False,1,Wicked.
1055,1055,1,Mark,False,4,I've got a sister.
1056,1056,1,Mark,False,4,She's a lawyer actually.
1057,1057,1,Mark,True,2,Don't boast!
1058,1058,1,Mark,False,5,What does your sister do?
1059,1059,1,Mark,True,8,That's what you get for trying to flirt.
1060,1060,1,Mark,False,5,"That's terrible, I'm so sorry."
1061,1061,1,Mark,False,9,"I suppose, I mean at least it's not cancer."
1062,1062,1,Mark,False,3,"Shit, that's terrible."
1063,1063,1,Mark,False,5,My gran died of cancer.
1064,1064,1,Mark,False,6,Although hopefully your sister won't... obviously.
1065,1065,1,Mark,False,6,"Listen, let's talk about something else."
1066,1066,1,Mark,False,2,Something fun.
1067,1067,1,Mark,False,4,Do you like Blackadder?
1068,1068,1,Mark,False,7,I got the Blackadder set for Christmas.
1069,1069,1,Mark,False,5,"No, no, sure, forget it."
1070,1070,1,Mark,False,2,Terrible idea.
1071,1071,1,Mark,False,4,I know something funny.
1072,1072,1,Mark,False,10,And he's been working on it for about a month!
1073,1073,1,Mark,False,6,"Wait, this is the best bit."
1074,1074,1,Mark,False,1,Jez!
1075,1075,1,Mark,True,3,Great idea Mark.
1076,1076,1,Mark,True,6,Humiliate your best mate just to.
1077,1077,1,Mark,True,8,I mean why didn't we just play Othello?
1078,1078,1,Mark,True,6,Oh I'd love to bang her.
1079,1079,1,Mark,True,9,"Just buckle down, do your time like Leslie Grantham."
1080,1080,1,Mark,False,4,"Hey Jez, you're up."
1081,1081,1,Mark,False,4,I'm making chicken tikka.
1082,1082,1,Mark,False,14,"Plus, I've bought us lots of great stuff: Dune on DVD, Bakewell slices, gin and Sara Lee."
1083,1083,1,Mark,False,12,"Plus, I was thinking, you know that thirty quid you owe me?"
1084,1084,1,Mark,False,5,"Let's call it quits, yeah?"
1085,1085,1,Mark,False,7,"I mean not quits, but you know."
1086,1086,1,Mark,False,8,"I'm just really, really, really, really sorry Jeremy."
1087,1087,1,Mark,False,7,Cos it was only a balls up.
1088,1088,1,Mark,False,7,"I ballsed up, and now we're fine."
1089,1089,1,Mark,False,15,This'll be ready in a minute and we can eat it in front of Hitler's Henchmen.
1090,1090,1,Mark,True,4,Maybe he doesn't mind.
1091,1091,1,Mark,True,9,Maybe nobody minds about things as much as me.
1092,1092,1,Mark,False,2,And listen.
1093,1093,1,Mark,False,3,You know Kerry?
1094,1094,1,Mark,False,2,Cancer Kerry?
1095,1095,1,Mark,False,18,I need to find out for a friend the name of that Chinese doctor she was raving about.
1096,1096,1,Mark,False,3,Can you remember?
1097,1097,1,Mark,False,2,Oh right.
1098,1098,1,Mark,False,5,"I see, I get it."
1099,1099,1,Mark,False,4,You were lampooning me.
1100,1100,1,Mark,False,5,It was a simple lampoon.
1101,1101,1,Mark,True,6,Why shouldn't I go for Toni?
1102,1102,1,Mark,True,4,So she scares me.
1103,1103,1,Mark,True,10,You can have good relationship with someone that scares you.
1104,1104,1,Mark,True,5,Look at me and dad.
1105,1105,1,Mark,True,2,Oh shit.
1106,1106,1,Mark,True,8,"Relax, relax, it's OK, you're not a paedo."
1107,1107,1,Mark,True,11,You're just a normal human being walking past some simple children.
1108,1108,1,Mark,False,2,Hi there.
1109,1109,1,Mark,True,2,Clean shirt?
1110,1110,1,Mark,True,4,What does that mean?
1111,1111,1,Mark,True,3,Isn't that good?
1112,1112,1,Mark,True,4,You can handle it.
1113,1113,1,Mark,True,5,Use the power of reason.
1114,1114,1,Mark,False,22,"Look, I know it must be difficult being a kid, not a lot of schemes, but you know, I'm not the borough."
1115,1115,1,Mark,False,5,I wish I was but.
1116,1116,1,Mark,False,4,I'm just a man.
1117,1117,1,Mark,False,3,Can't we just.
1118,1118,1,Mark,False,1,Hey!
1119,1119,1,Mark,False,1,No!
1120,1120,1,Mark,False,1,Ow!
1121,1121,1,Mark,False,4,Don't kick my bum!
1122,1122,1,Mark,False,2,Stop it!
1123,1123,1,Mark,True,6,"Me and Toni, Toni and me."
1124,1124,1,Mark,True,11,When his kooky charm starts to cloy I'll be right there.
1125,1125,1,Mark,True,4,Fuck buddy number two.
1126,1126,1,Mark,True,13,"Yeah right, wait for the crumbs to fall while my nuts slowly shrivel."
1127,1127,1,Mark,True,9,"Actually I hope they do shrivel, they're getting disturbingly…"
1128,1128,1,Mark,False,3,But how did?
1129,1129,1,Mark,False,4,What does it mean?
1130,1130,1,Mark,False,4,"Look, I'm sorry, OK?"
1131,1131,1,Mark,False,9,I'm sorry I humiliated you in front of Toni.
1132,1132,1,Mark,False,8,"Oh right, the gloves are off are they?"
1133,1133,1,Mark,False,13,"Well, perhaps it's best you do know what I think of your music."
1134,1134,1,Mark,False,15,"Oh really, well I'd love to know in what way I am a posh spaz."
1135,1135,1,Mark,False,6,I do not iron my socks!
1136,1136,1,Mark,True,12,I'm going to the party and I'll get her in the end.
1137,1137,1,Mark,True,11,"I have the power of the brain, the most erotic muscle."
1138,1138,1,Mark,True,8,The longbow beats the crossbow my idiotic friend.
1139,1139,1,Mark,False,1,Hey!
1140,1140,1,Mark,False,4,"Look, just lay off."
1141,1141,1,Mark,False,3,That's my bit of lager!
1142,1142,1,Mark,False,3,Don't be ridiculous.
1143,1143,1,Mark,False,12,"You just... you... you're lucky I don't... you're just very, very lucky."
1144,1144,1,Mark,False,1,What?
1145,1145,1,Mark,False,3,How did you?
1146,1146,1,Mark,False,7,So I'm glad we cleared the air.
1147,1147,1,Mark,False,5,"I feel better, much better."
1148,1148,1,Mark,False,6,Like a weight has been lifted.
1149,1149,1,Mark,False,1,Neighbours?
1150,1150,1,Mark,False,21,"Yeah, well its great to know your neighbours, I mean not just from a home security point of view but also…"
1151,1151,1,Mark,True,9,"Maybe I should forget it, leave her to him."
1152,1152,1,Mark,True,5,Concentrate on the long game.
1153,1153,1,Mark,True,12,"Work on a six pack by Christmas then make, Why should I?"
1154,1154,1,Mark,True,11,We really had something going when we were laughing at Jeremy!
1155,1155,1,Mark,True,5,"Oh too late, they're bonding."
1156,1156,1,Mark,True,3,"Ha ha, twot."
1157,1157,1,Mark,False,6,"We're not playing for points, mate."
1158,1158,1,Mark,False,1,No!
1159,1159,1,Mark,False,1,Don't!
1160,1160,1,Mark,False,5,"Go on, this one's mine!"
1161,1161,1,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, how did you know?"
1162,1162,1,Mark,False,4,"The Home Secretary, Jeremy."
1163,1163,1,Mark,False,4,You're the Home Secretary.
1164,1164,1,Mark,False,4,You're going next door?
1165,1165,1,Mark,True,4,The coast is clear.
1166,1166,1,Mark,True,4,The coast is clear!
1167,1167,1,Mark,True,4,I am in here.
1168,1168,1,Mark,True,1,Sis?
1169,1169,1,Mark,True,1,Sister!
1170,1170,1,Mark,True,1,Shit!
1171,1171,1,Mark,False,2,Excuse me.
1172,1172,1,Mark,False,1,Jez?
1173,1173,1,Mark,False,5,Can I have a word?
1174,1174,1,Mark,False,11,"I though I better tell you, Paula, she's... she has cancer."
1175,1175,1,Mark,False,7,I just thought I'd better mention it.
1176,1176,1,Mark,False,6,You don't wanna drop a clanger.
1177,1177,1,Mark,True,10,"OK Mark, you asked for it, now you got it."
1178,1178,1,Mark,True,9,"She's looking for a fuck buddy, gotta change gears."
1179,1179,1,Mark,True,3,Sauce things up.
1180,1180,1,Mark,False,11,Yeah so Jeremy tells me you two watched a porno together.
1181,1181,1,Mark,False,5,"You know, I'd be into…"
1182,1182,1,Mark,True,1,Ha!
1183,1183,1,Mark,True,4,What an idiotic boob.
1184,1184,1,Mark,True,4,"He's out, I'm in."
1185,1185,1,Mark,True,4,"Now, what's my shtick?"
1186,1186,1,Mark,True,1,Yeah.
1187,1187,1,Mark,False,14,"You know, the Red Army shot sixteen thousand of their own men at Stalingrad."
1188,1188,1,Mark,False,12,"And of course, the majority of the Wehrmacht had no winter clothing."
1189,1189,1,Mark,True,6,I'm the tank commander now Barry.
1190,1190,1,Mark,False,16,"See, by the winter of '42, the whole city was surrounded by the massed 6th army."
1191,1191,1,Mark,False,5,It was pressing and pressing.
1192,1192,1,Mark,False,7,The Russians couldn't hold on much longer.
1193,1193,1,Mark,False,4,Many wanted to submit...
1194,1194,1,Mark,False,23,"No, no, of course not, what I mean is that the German supply lines were stretched, Zhukov countered and the siege was broken."
1195,1195,1,Mark,False,6,And that's the story of Stalingrad.
1196,1196,1,Mark,True,3,That was embarrassing.
1197,1197,1,Mark,True,4,Not a fuck jar.
1198,1198,1,Mark,True,6,"Don't dwell, no need to dwell."
1199,1199,1,Mark,True,3,"Think charming, considerate."
1200,1200,1,Mark,False,7,"So your sister, she looks great considering..."
1201,1201,1,Mark,False,7,"No, no, you know, the whole thing."
1202,1202,1,Mark,False,2,The leukaemia.
1203,1203,1,Mark,True,3,The second front.
1204,1204,1,Mark,True,7,I can win on the second front.
1205,1205,1,Mark,True,4,This is so perfect.
1206,1206,1,Mark,True,20,I'm gonna be the knight on horseback with an armful of booze and enough nachos to feed the Mexican army.
1207,1207,1,Mark,True,2,Oh shit.
1208,1208,1,Mark,True,1,Shit.
1209,1209,1,Mark,True,2,Fuck off!
1210,1210,1,Mark,True,7,Why don't you fuck the fuck off?
1211,1211,1,Mark,True,8,"Just run the gauntlet, the little bastards will..."
1212,1212,1,Mark,True,5,It's gonna shut as well.
1213,1213,1,Mark,False,4,"Uh, excuse me, mate?"
1214,1214,1,Mark,False,24,"Sorry to bother you, this is a bit embarrassing really but you couldn't possibly buy me a couple bottles of wine, Pinot Grigio maybe?"
1215,1215,1,Mark,True,7,I bet Zhukov would've got some booze.
1216,1216,1,Mark,True,1,Oh!
1217,1217,1,Mark,True,1,Bastard.
1218,1218,1,Mark,False,1,What?
1219,1219,1,Mark,False,5,"Oh Jeremy, I'm so sorry."
1220,1220,1,Mark,False,2,I thought...
1221,1221,1,Mark,False,7,I accidentally told him Paula had cancer.
1222,1222,1,Mark,False,1,Hey!
1223,1223,1,Mark,False,6,"Listen mate, I made a mistake."
1224,1224,1,Mark,False,14,It was you who wouldn't give the name of the doctor for Toni's sister.
1225,1225,1,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, well really really nice to catch up, Soph."
1226,1226,1,Mark,False,3,See you tomorrow?
1227,1227,1,Mark,False,1,Great
1228,1228,1,Mark,True,4,"Yes, that's the way."
1229,1229,1,Mark,True,3,Sophie's the one.
1230,1230,1,Mark,True,6,"Toni's Russia - vast, mysterious, unconquerable."
1231,1231,1,Mark,True,12,"Sophie's Poland - manageable, won't put up too much of a fight."
1232,1232,1,Mark,True,1,Shit.
1233,1233,1,Mark,True,2,Oh shit.
1234,1234,1,Mark,True,6,"OK. You want some, do you?"
1235,1235,1,Mark,True,8,Do you want a taste of my steel?
1236,1236,2,Mark,True,8,I wonder what kind of socks Sophie wears.
1237,1237,2,Mark,True,4,Do women wear socks?
1238,1238,2,Mark,True,8,"Well, yes, sometimes is the answer to that."
1239,1239,2,Mark,True,13,"Socks before or after trousers, but never socks before pants, that's the rule."
1240,1240,2,Mark,True,8,"Makes a man look scary, like a chicken."
1241,1241,2,Mark,True,8,He just does not give one solitary shit.
1242,1242,2,Mark,True,7,"Brown for first course, white for pudding."
1243,1243,2,Mark,True,6,"Brown is savoury, white's the treat."
1244,1244,2,Mark,True,12,'Course I'm the one who's laughing because I actually love brown toast.
1245,1245,2,Mark,False,2,Dr. J!
1246,1246,2,Mark,False,14,Sorry I didn't manage to hook up with you and Super Hans last night...
1247,1247,2,Mark,False,11,"then Barbara pops up with ""Is the Birbeck file ready yet?"""
1248,1248,2,Mark,False,11,I didn't get a chance to tell you the good news.
1249,1249,2,Mark,False,17,"Yeah, there's a vacancy going for a clerical assistant and I've managed to swing you an interview."
1250,1250,2,Mark,False,7,So is tomorrow at eleven all right?
1251,1251,2,Mark,False,20,"It's a damn good company and it'll be the two of us together, Jez and Mez, the El Dude Brothers."
1252,1252,2,Mark,False,10,"You know how much I respect your music, it's just…"
1253,1253,2,Mark,False,4,I'm on your side.
1254,1254,2,Mark,False,11,"Every artist needs his patron but, you know, there's a limit."
1255,1255,2,Mark,False,15,"I'm not some kind of land baron trying to milk his cash cow, it's just…"
1256,1256,2,Mark,False,1,Sorry?
1257,1257,2,Mark,False,1,Right?
1258,1258,2,Mark,False,23,"But listen Jeremy, just in case the song doesn't work out, maybe you'd better fill this out and fax it over by three."
1259,1259,2,Mark,False,3,Think about it.
1260,1260,2,Mark,False,6,"And have a great day, yeah?"
1261,1261,2,Mark,False,3,See you tonight.
1262,1262,2,Mark,False,3,"You, too, mate."
1263,1263,2,Mark,True,2,Work-shy freeloader.
1264,1264,2,Mark,True,9,I wonder what Sophie's flirty cartoon will be today.
1265,1265,2,Mark,True,8,I really should ask her out for lunch.
1266,1266,2,Mark,False,4,Can you hold that?
1267,1267,2,Mark,True,2,You bastard.
1268,1268,2,Mark,False,1,Thanks.
1269,1269,2,Mark,False,2,Third floor?
1270,1270,2,Mark,True,8,"I mean, what's the worst that could happen?"
1271,1271,2,Mark,True,4,She could say no.
1272,1272,2,Mark,True,5,"Actually, that would be terrible."
1273,1273,2,Mark,True,8,It would destroy me if she said no.
1274,1274,2,Mark,False,15,"There is a notice, you know, about only riding the lift to the first floor."
1275,1275,2,Mark,False,10,"You're wasting mine and other people's time, not to mention…"
1276,1276,2,Mark,False,1,Oh.
1277,1277,2,Mark,False,2,"Uh, OK."
1278,1278,2,Mark,True,6,People like him should wear stickers.
1279,1279,2,Mark,True,6,They've got them for their cars.
1280,1280,2,Mark,True,2,"Oh, yeah."
1281,1281,2,Mark,True,3,"Great idea, Adolf."
1282,1282,2,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Sophie."
1283,1283,2,Mark,True,4,"Go on, ask her."
1284,1284,2,Mark,False,3,"Sophie, are you..."
1285,1285,2,Mark,False,9,"I mean, would... how's your day going thus far?"
1286,1286,2,Mark,False,6,Have a nice shower or bath?
1287,1287,2,Mark,False,5,"God, no, you don't smell."
1288,1288,2,Mark,False,5,"I mean, you smell nice."
1289,1289,2,Mark,False,5,Not that I've smelt you.
1290,1290,2,Mark,False,2,"Later, potater."
1291,1291,2,Mark,True,2,"Uh, potater."
1292,1292,2,Mark,True,4,What have I become?
1293,1293,2,Mark,True,4," OK, where's today's cartoon?"
1294,1294,2,Mark,True,3,"Mmm, not bad."
1295,1295,2,Mark,True,4,No discernible romantic overtones.
1296,1296,2,Mark,True,6,"OK pen, let's flirt with Sophie."
1297,1297,2,Mark,True,5, What the hell is that?
1298,1298,2,Mark,True,8,"That is very gay, that's what that is."
1299,1299,2,Mark,True,4,"Come on, go crazy!"
1300,1300,2,Mark,True,5,You're hungry like the wolf!
1301,1301,2,Mark,True,6, (I'm giving her a love heart.
1302,1302,2,Mark,True,3,"Yes, that's good."
1303,1303,2,Mark,True,5,"No, no, it's not good."
1304,1304,2,Mark,True,2,It's terrible.
1305,1305,2,Mark,True,7,"Think ""crazy horse"", think ""in your face""."
1306,1306,2,Mark,True,4,What would Jeremy do?
1307,1307,2,Mark,True,8,"Heh heh, yeah, that's it, love's for Nazis.)"
1308,1308,2,Mark,True,3,"Yeah, crazy love."
1309,1309,2,Mark,True,2,Nazi love.
1310,1310,2,Mark,True,3,I'm a nutter!
1311,1311,2,Mark,True,15,And then I go and seal the deal by doing something wicked like this car-toon.
1312,1312,2,Mark,True,2,Swastika love.
1313,1313,2,Mark,True,3,It's bloody mental.
1314,1314,2,Mark,True,3,A bloody swastika.
1315,1315,2,Mark,True,9,That is the single worst single bloody idea ever.
1316,1316,2,Mark,True,4,"I mean, a swastika!"
1317,1317,2,Mark,True,2,It's gone.
1318,1318,2,Mark,True,2,It's happened.
1319,1319,2,Mark,True,7,"Oh, yeah, do what Jeremy would do."
1320,1320,2,Mark,True,4,"Thanks, Jeremy, you tit."
1321,1321,2,Mark,True,7,"Enter the pit of Sarlacc, little crisps."
1322,1322,2,Mark,True,3,She's ignoring me.
1323,1323,2,Mark,True,13,"Of course, she's ignoring me, this morning I sent her a bloody swastika."
1324,1324,2,Mark,True,1,Jesus!
1325,1325,2,Mark,True,15,"This is the worst thing that has ever happened to anyone ever and... relax, Mark."
1326,1326,2,Mark,True,6,You're not Hitler in his bunker.
1327,1327,2,Mark,True,6,He was really under the cosh.
1328,1328,2,Mark,True,8,"Mind you, at least he had a girlfriend."
1329,1329,2,Mark,True,13,"OK, enough mooning, let's strap on the nosebag and eat some serious work."
1330,1330,2,Mark,True,4,Blown it with Sophie.
1331,1331,2,Mark,True,2,Who's next?
1332,1332,2,Mark,True,2,Big Suze?
1333,1333,2,Mark,True,7,"Never met her, not necessarily a disadvantage."
1334,1334,2,Mark,True,15,"Why don't I get this fixed, why don't I ever get this fucking thing fixed?!"
1335,1335,2,Mark,True,12,"Every night it's fift- ah, it always comes out eventually, fuck it."
1336,1336,2,Mark,False,5,"Oh, I'm so, you did?"
1337,1337,2,Mark,False,2,Race hate?
1338,1338,2,Mark,False,2,"Right, exactly."
1339,1339,2,Mark,False,12,"Listen, Sophie, I was wondering if I could get your home number."
1340,1340,2,Mark,False,18,"I mean, for work, in case I need to swap a shift or... that is, if you don't…"
1341,1341,2,Mark,True,4,She's actually writing it.
1342,1342,2,Mark,False,7,"Oh, hang on, this isn't enough numbers."
1343,1343,2,Mark,False,6,"Oh, no, it is enough numbers."
1344,1344,2,Mark,True,10,"Oh, God, I hope she doesn't mind about my balls."
1345,1345,2,Mark,False,1,Exactly.
1346,1346,2,Mark,False,17,"If it's such a bad thing to do things by the book, there wouldn't be a book."
1347,1347,2,Mark,True,11,Have to keep an eye on him if he gets it.
1348,1348,2,Mark,True,11,"If there's one thing JLB does not need, it's a maverick."
1349,1349,2,Mark,False,7,"So anyway, things went rather well with…"
1350,1350,2,Mark,False,2,"Oh, what?"
1351,1351,2,Mark,False,4,Just because he's black?
1352,1352,2,Mark,False,5,I know what you meant.
1353,1353,2,Mark,False,8,"Anyway, in the end, I got Sophie's number."
1354,1354,2,Mark,False,10,So do you think I should give her a call?
1355,1355,2,Mark,False,13,"I probably should, shouldn't I. Oh I really don't know if I should."
1356,1356,2,Mark,False,12,"OK listen, if God's doing mountains or sky or water, I'll call."
1357,1357,2,Mark,False,8,"If he's doing trees or critters, I won't."
1358,1358,2,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, sky!"
1359,1359,2,Mark,False,3,"Right, here goes."
1360,1360,2,Mark,False,1,Answerphone.
1361,1361,2,Mark,False,2," Uh, Sophie."
1362,1362,2,Mark,False,11,"If you heard that, please ignore it, I'm not a racist."
1363,1363,2,Mark,False,3,Far from it.
1364,1364,2,Mark,False,8,Anyway uh it's good to hear your voice.
1365,1365,2,Mark,False,40,"I know it's only a recording but you have got a bloody nice voice and... God, I just called up to say hi and then, then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I like you."
1366,1366,2,Mark,False,4,"I mean, not that."
1367,1367,2,Mark,False,33,"But anyway I noticed that the paper in the photocopier is running a bit low so I know it's not really your job but uh well you know, so, uh see you tomorrow."
1368,1368,2,Mark,False,4,"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
1369,1369,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, my God."
1370,1370,2,Mark,False,6,I've really fucked it haven't I?
1371,1371,2,Mark,False,4,Have I fucked it?
1372,1372,2,Mark,False,7,It was the behaviour of an oddball.
1373,1373,2,Mark,False,1,No.
1374,1374,2,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
1375,1375,2,Mark,False,1,What?
1376,1376,2,Mark,False,6,Why are you talking like this?
1377,1377,2,Mark,False,4,You're doing pyramid selling?
1378,1378,2,Mark,False,7,I can't believe you're into pyramid selling.
1379,1379,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, the charts."
1380,1380,2,Mark,False,3,There are charts.
1381,1381,2,Mark,False,8,Why didn't you tell me about the charts?
1382,1382,2,Mark,False,10,I'm trying to protect you from pissing all over yourself.
1383,1383,2,Mark,False,6,You're still coming to the interview.
1384,1384,2,Mark,False,7,"Listen, Jeremy, you don't seem to understand."
1385,1385,2,Mark,False,7,Nothing you want is ever gonna happen.
1386,1386,2,Mark,False,4,That's the real world.
1387,1387,2,Mark,False,10,"Your hair isn't red, people don't walk around on stilts."
1388,1388,2,Mark,False,30,"Maybe somewhere, you can earn a living sitting around drinking margaritas through a curly plastic straw, but in this world, you've got to turn up, log on and grind out."
1389,1389,2,Mark,False,9,"Come Friday, you will owe me three months' rent."
1390,1390,2,Mark,False,5,You're coming to the interview.
1391,1391,2,Mark,False,1,What?
1392,1392,2,Mark,True,7,Maybe she will think it was charming.
1393,1393,2,Mark,True,2,"Yeah, maybe."
1394,1394,2,Mark,True,36,"Just keep clear of her until you've worked out a, I could say Jeremy had a gun and made me sing it, because he's a crackhead and he does that sort of thing all the time."
1395,1395,2,Mark,True,22,"Yeah yeah, that sounds great, me living in my crack house, maybe you can be a crack bitch, and sit on my..."
1396,1396,2,Mark,True,1,Shit!
1397,1397,2,Mark,True,7,"Shit, sugar, fudge, piss, poop, pants, bollocks."
1398,1398,2,Mark,True,2,"Yes, blitzkrieg!"
1399,1399,2,Mark,True,4,I'm in the Ardennes!
1400,1400,2,Mark,True,7,You can't touch me in the Ardennes.
1401,1401,2,Mark,True,4,Concealed in the cupboard.
1402,1402,2,Mark,True,5,Everything's OK in the cupboard.
1403,1403,2,Mark,True,5,I'm safe in the cupboard.
1404,1404,2,Mark,False,3,"That's right, Jeff."
1405,1405,2,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, well..."
1406,1406,2,Mark,False,2,Hi Sophie.
1407,1407,2,Mark,False,7,I'm just in the cupboard right now.
1408,1408,2,Mark,False,7,"About the message, we'll talk later, yeah?"
1409,1409,2,Mark,True,1,Nooooo!
1410,1410,2,Mark,True,4,He looks like crap.
1411,1411,2,Mark,True,18,"Great, he'll be able to pay off the Blockbusters fine, plus I'll be able to order him around."
1412,1412,2,Mark,True,10,"Not horrible, just ""Jeremy, could you file this for me?"
1413,1413,2,Mark,True,7,"Jeremy, could you take that for me?"
1414,1414,2,Mark,True,7,"Jeremy, could you suck this for me?"""
1415,1415,2,Mark,True,1,Jesus!
1416,1416,2,Mark,True,5,Where did that come from?
1417,1417,2,Mark,False,1,Challenging.
1418,1418,2,Mark,False,3,He means challenging.
1419,1419,2,Mark,False,2,"Yes, right."
1420,1420,2,Mark,False,1,What?
1421,1421,2,Mark,False,2,What thing?
1422,1422,2,Mark,False,6,Facial spa... you do not have…
1423,1423,2,Mark,False,2,"No, Jeremy."
1424,1424,2,Mark,False,8,"It's pyramid selling Barbara, I'm very sorry and…"
1425,1425,2,Mark,False,11,It is pyramid selling and you're making a fool of yourself.
1426,1426,2,Mark,False,4,There is no bonfire!
1427,1427,2,Mark,False,3,This is low.
1428,1428,2,Mark,False,4,This is really low.
1429,1429,2,Mark,False,4,What does that mean?
1430,1430,2,Mark,False,11,I literally have no idea what that is supposed to mean!
1431,1431,2,Mark,True,6,"Well, that was a fucking disaster."
1432,1432,2,Mark,True,3,I want compensation.
1433,1433,2,Mark,True,5,"I want reparations, brutal reparations!"
1434,1434,2,Mark,True,4,I want the Rhineland.
1435,1435,2,Mark,True,8,It's going to be 1919 all over again.
1436,1436,2,Mark,True,4,Fuck the inevitable backlash!
1437,1437,2,Mark,True,1,OK.
1438,1438,2,Mark,True,3,"It's OK, Mark."
1439,1439,2,Mark,True,1,Later.
1440,1440,2,Mark,True,2,"Now, calm."
1441,1441,2,Mark,True,4,"Calm, honest and mature."
1442,1442,2,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Sophie."
1443,1443,2,Mark,False,2,Oh yeah?
1444,1444,2,Mark,False,1,Huh.
1445,1445,2,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
1446,1446,2,Mark,True,7,"Get your tanks off my lawn, Jeremy."
1447,1447,2,Mark,False,9,"But uh listen, Sophie, about the message last night."
1448,1448,2,Mark,False,8,I want to kind of come clean really.
1449,1449,2,Mark,False,22,"It's a bit embarrassing but, well, the thing is Jeremy, sometimes, for a laugh, makes me say things with a bread knife."
1450,1450,2,Mark,False,8,I mean he's obviously not a crackhead but…
1451,1451,2,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1452,1452,2,Mark,False,2,I don't?
1453,1453,2,Mark,False,2,Is it?
1454,1454,2,Mark,False,2,It is?
1455,1455,2,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
1456,1456,2,Mark,False,1,Fantastic.
1457,1457,2,Mark,False,7,And you haven't told anyone about it?
1458,1458,2,Mark,False,9,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
1459,1459,2,Mark,True,7,"Calm down, she's not bloody Pontius Pilate."
1460,1460,2,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, well, you know the truth is... the truth is, I suppose I like you."
1461,1461,2,Mark,False,6,That's why I said the song.
1462,1462,2,Mark,False,3,I like you.
1463,1463,2,Mark,False,5,Is that such a crime?
1464,1464,2,Mark,False,14,Should I be hounded to the ends of the Earth just for liking you?
1465,1465,2,Mark,False,16,"I like you and if you can't handle it, you can just, you know, fuck off."
1466,1466,2,Mark,False,1,Good.
1467,1467,2,Mark,False,2,"Right, excellent."
1468,1468,2,Mark,False,2,OK. Bye.
1469,1469,2,Mark,False,6,"Er, yeah right, I'm really sorry."
1470,1470,2,Mark,False,13,"I mean, I thought it would be a good, that he might, but…"
1471,1471,2,Mark,False,1,Hey!
1472,1472,2,Mark,False,2,"Hey, there!"
1473,1473,2,Mark,False,5,"Feeling better now, are we?"
1474,1474,2,Mark,False,2,Fully recovered?
1475,1475,2,Mark,False,4,"Hey, I see you!"
1476,1476,2,Mark,False,3,I see you!
1477,1477,2,Mark,False,6,He used to have a limp!
1478,1478,2,Mark,False,8,"I mean, he pretended to have a limp."
1479,1479,2,Mark,False,5,He's a faking little peg-leg!
1480,1480,2,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Jeff."
1481,1481,2,Mark,True,16,"Well, fuck you if you're not doing small talk, I'm not going to help us out."
1482,1482,2,Mark,True,3,Let's die together.
1483,1483,3,Mark,True,4, Life's all pain.
1484,1484,3,Mark,True,4,"Pain, rejection and gloom."
1485,1485,3,Mark,True,17,"Why do we even pretend there's anything other than a yawning blankness at the heart of, Hey!"
1486,1486,3,Mark,True,3,33% extra free.
1487,1487,3,Mark,True,5,I am doing excellent shopping.
1488,1488,3,Mark,True,14,My depressed state of mind means I am being even more frugal than normal.
1489,1489,3,Mark,False,2,Hey Jeremy.
1490,1490,3,Mark,False,3,"Oh no, mate."
1491,1491,3,Mark,False,8,This stuff is 78 pence a hundred millilitres.
1492,1492,3,Mark,False,7,"Look Jeremy, we've been through this before."
1493,1493,3,Mark,False,20,I do the joint shopping solo because I don't make impulse purchases and I'm less swayed by the power of…
1494,1494,3,Mark,False,13,Do I look like the kind of man who goes to wicked parties?
1495,1495,3,Mark,False,5,Why don't you ask Toni?
1496,1496,3,Mark,False,5,"Don't be ridiculous, they're homey."
1497,1497,3,Mark,False,5,They're for wiping up mess.
1498,1498,3,Mark,False,4,Well they're for men!
1499,1499,3,Mark,False,5,"Men's noses, big manly snot."
1500,1500,3,Mark,False,1,What?
1501,1501,3,Mark,False,17,Why do you have to have a huge can of lager that makes you really really drunk?
1502,1502,3,Mark,False,4,What's wrong with moderation?
1503,1503,3,Mark,False,9,That's not going to be happening any time soon.
1504,1504,3,Mark,False,1,Mm-hm.
1505,1505,3,Mark,False,13,I mean it's not a date or anything because I've got a megapass.
1506,1506,3,Mark,False,10,How do you feel about row G by the way?
1507,1507,3,Mark,False,3,"Yeah, I thought-"
1508,1508,3,Mark,False,3,"No, thank you."
1509,1509,3,Mark,False,14,How much pain can I experience at home with a spaghetti carbonara and Das Boot.
1510,1510,3,Mark,False,2,That's right.
1511,1511,3,Mark,False,8,"No queues, so who exactly is winning then?"
1512,1512,3,Mark,True,11,"OK, well, I'm here, so I'll just sit here and drink."
1513,1513,3,Mark,True,7,No one can stop me doing that.
1514,1514,3,Mark,True,5,Just drink myself to death.
1515,1515,3,Mark,True,16,I bet he gets sex tonight and I have to listen to it through the wall.
1516,1516,3,Mark,True,13,Maybe she might go to the bathroom and accidentally come into my room.
1517,1517,3,Mark,True,3,And then what?
1518,1518,3,Mark,True,3,She fucks you?
1519,1519,3,Mark,True,7,"No, she says ""whoops"" and goes out."
1520,1520,3,Mark,True,5,Stop doing this to yourself.
1521,1521,3,Mark,True,11,"Someone here's got psoriasis, one of the less common skin ailments."
1522,1522,3,Mark,True,13,"Basic yeast infection, rash if you're thinking glamorous, athlete's foot if you're not."
1523,1523,3,Mark,True,4,A fellow migraine sufferer?
1524,1524,3,Mark,True,14,"Everyone at this party isn't as young, fit and single as they're making out."
1525,1525,3,Mark,True,11,"Yes let's face it, we're all falling apart piece by piece."
1526,1526,3,Mark,True,9,Doesn't matter if you're single or in a couple.
1527,1527,3,Mark,True,1,You.
1528,1528,3,Mark,True,1,Are.
1529,1529,3,Mark,True,1,Going.
1530,1530,3,Mark,True,1,To.
1531,1531,3,Mark,True,1,Die.
1532,1532,3,Mark,False,2,Frozen stuff.
1533,1533,3,Mark,False,6,I don't want them to thaw.
1534,1534,3,Mark,False,1,Yeah!
1535,1535,3,Mark,False,6,That would be the natural reaction.
1536,1536,3,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, sure."
1537,1537,3,Mark,False,6,Oh I'm not in the game.
1538,1538,3,Mark,False,11,"If I can get my shopping home intact, I'll be happy."
1539,1539,3,Mark,False,10,"That, to me, is a very attractive system you're proposing."
1540,1540,3,Mark,False,12,"Yeah, well you know, everything's decaying, so the way I see it."
1541,1541,3,Mark,False,15,Has there ever been a better time to save up for a very comfortable sofa?
1542,1542,3,Mark,True,7,"She's a teenager for God's sake, Mark."
1543,1543,3,Mark,True,6,You'll get castrated by the menfolk.
1544,1544,3,Mark,True,5,"Maybe she's a- Oh, God."
1545,1545,3,Mark,False,5,Oh that's a bit much.
1546,1546,3,Mark,False,7,Just pretend you need his bone marrow.
1547,1547,3,Mark,False,3,Apparently that's agony.
1548,1548,3,Mark,False,13,"Hey Jez, I just wanted to tell you we're going... to the Lazerbowl."
1549,1549,3,Mark,False,4,"Yeah, me and Valerie."
1550,1550,3,Mark,False,21,We were going to kill her brother but then we thought it might be more fun to go to the Lazerbowl.
1551,1551,3,Mark,False,14,"I hadn't thought you would be... maybe I'll see you later at home, yeah?"
1552,1552,3,Mark,False,6,Would you mind taking the shopping?
1553,1553,3,Mark,False,8,I've left some stuff in the freezer compartment.
1554,1554,3,Mark,False,1,Er...
1555,1555,3,Mark,False,2,I mean...
1556,1556,3,Mark,False,2,I guess…
1557,1557,3,Mark,False,3,You think so?
1558,1558,3,Mark,True,8,I've got to take Jeremy's advice more often.
1559,1559,3,Mark,True,15,"I'm out on a date with a teenage goth, smoking pot in the Lazerbowl toilets."
1560,1560,3,Mark,True,3,This is it.
1561,1561,3,Mark,True,4,This is literally it.
1562,1562,3,Mark,True,14,This is the sort of thing people do when they're having a good time.
1563,1563,3,Mark,False,4,I don't know if…
1564,1564,3,Mark,False,1,What?
1565,1565,3,Mark,False,2,In here?
1566,1566,3,Mark,True,9,"Oh my God, it's the last days of Rome."
1567,1567,3,Mark,False,1,Wow!
1568,1568,3,Mark,True,3,I've been initiated.
1569,1569,3,Mark,True,5,I am a drug user.
1570,1570,3,Mark,True,3,Fuck the police!
1571,1571,3,Mark,False,5,"Jez, the faces, the faces."
1572,1572,3,Mark,False,3,I feel strange.
1573,1573,3,Mark,False,4,Don't poke my eyes!
1574,1574,3,Mark,False,4,Don't poke my eyes!
1575,1575,3,Mark,False,4,I don't think so.
1576,1576,3,Mark,False,5,What if I lose it?
1577,1577,3,Mark,False,10,"I'm not going to do a poo, am I Jez?"
1578,1578,3,Mark,True,4,Jez is so great.
1579,1579,3,Mark,True,9,He's like an idiot savant but not so stupid.
1580,1580,3,Mark,True,15,I bet he's totally sorting this whole night in his head for us right now.
1581,1581,3,Mark,False,2,"Uh-huh, yeah."
1582,1582,3,Mark,False,2,Me too.
1583,1583,3,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, right, obviously, no... me too."
1584,1584,3,Mark,False,6,I guess she just really likes Sledgehammer.
1585,1585,3,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1586,1586,3,Mark,True,3,Forgive me Peter.
1587,1587,3,Mark,False,5,I mean it's so... outdated.
1588,1588,3,Mark,False,6,"Right, I mean what's her problem?"
1589,1589,3,Mark,False,7,I've never heard of Level 42 either.
1590,1590,3,Mark,True,4,"Guys, I'm so sorry."
1591,1591,3,Mark,False,2,You are?
1592,1592,3,Mark,False,1,Right.
1593,1593,3,Mark,False,7,I just didn't want to disturb them.
1594,1594,3,Mark,True,3,Oh my God.
1595,1595,3,Mark,True,3,Oh my God.
1596,1596,3,Mark,True,3,Oh my God.
1597,1597,3,Mark,False,2,Hi... Sophie.
1598,1598,3,Mark,False,3,This is Valerie.
1599,1599,3,Mark,False,3,How's it going?
1600,1600,3,Mark,False,3,"Yeah, yeah, fine."
1601,1601,3,Mark,False,24,"I- Valerie and I- I mean we just met and we thought we might come here for a few bowls, and I'm high, obviously."
1602,1602,3,Mark,False,3,How about you?
1603,1603,3,Mark,False,1,Jeff?
1604,1604,3,Mark,False,1,!
1605,1605,3,Mark,False,3,Yeah it's great.
1606,1606,3,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, Jeff did do that, actually."
1607,1607,3,Mark,False,3,No that's true.
1608,1608,3,Mark,False,9,You were something of a trendsetter in that area.
1609,1609,3,Mark,False,4,"She's at college, actually."
1610,1610,3,Mark,False,4,Yeah that's still college.
1611,1611,3,Mark,True,13,"For the worst thing that could possibly happen, this is going extremely well."
1612,1612,3,Mark,True,2,I'm bursting!
1613,1613,3,Mark,True,14,"This is why you should stick to the little cans, ah, the simple pleasures."
1614,1614,3,Mark,True,1,Oh…
1615,1615,3,Mark,False,3,"Uh, yeah, yeah."
1616,1616,3,Mark,False,9,"Well you know, it's just a bit of fun."
1617,1617,3,Mark,True,3,"Oh God, go."
1618,1618,3,Mark,True,9,I'm never going to be able to go now.
1619,1619,3,Mark,True,4,Why can't I go?
1620,1620,3,Mark,True,1,Fuck!
1621,1621,3,Mark,True,2,"Italian, wine."
1622,1622,3,Mark,True,5,Why didn't I ask her?
1623,1623,3,Mark,True,3,It's all- Shit!
1624,1624,3,Mark,True,2,"Waterfalls, nothing!"
1625,1625,3,Mark,True,3,Pretend you've finished.
1626,1626,3,Mark,True,1,Ahh!
1627,1627,3,Mark,False,1,What?
1628,1628,3,Mark,False,1,You-
1629,1629,3,Mark,True,5,"She hates fruit, except pears."
1630,1630,3,Mark,True,6,"If there's pear flavour, I'm fucked."
1631,1631,3,Mark,False,4,So this is nice.
1632,1632,3,Mark,False,4,Kind of weird but...
1633,1633,3,Mark,False,14,"Great, so I was just wondering how you ended up coming out with Jeff."
1634,1634,3,Mark,False,3,He asked you?
1635,1635,3,Mark,False,2,Of course.
1636,1636,3,Mark,False,5,Is that all it takes?
1637,1637,3,Mark,False,8,I mean I did actually ask you myself.
1638,1638,3,Mark,False,4,"Oh, Valerie, she's nothing."
1639,1639,3,Mark,True,4,That didn't sound good.
1640,1640,3,Mark,False,2,I mean...
1641,1641,3,Mark,False,6,It's just... A little nice out.
1642,1642,3,Mark,False,6,I'm a friend of her brother's.
1643,1643,3,Mark,False,5,"He's a total wanker, actually."
1644,1644,3,Mark,False,10,"So, have you had a good time on your... date?"
1645,1645,3,Mark,True,1,Ha!
1646,1646,3,Mark,True,1,Idiot!
1647,1647,3,Mark,True,2,I win!
1648,1648,3,Mark,False,1,Cool.
1649,1649,3,Mark,False,15,"So, old seat sniffer, he didn't sniff any of the seats or anything, didn't he?"
1650,1650,3,Mark,False,3,A nice guy?
1651,1651,3,Mark,False,2,You should've…
1652,1652,3,Mark,False,5,You're having a good time.
1653,1653,3,Mark,False,9,"Good, because obviously, I'm having a great time too."
1654,1654,3,Mark,True,6,She's not going to do it.
1655,1655,3,Mark,True,4,They won't do it.
1656,1656,3,Mark,True,8,Don't let him know he's got to you.
1657,1657,3,Mark,True,3,Play it cool.
1658,1658,3,Mark,True,3,Play it suave.
1659,1659,3,Mark,False,7,"I think I can manage that, mate."
1660,1660,3,Mark,False,4,"Watch me bowl, Jeff!"
1661,1661,3,Mark,False,7,"I'm bowling all right, I'm bowling fruit!"
1662,1662,3,Mark,False,4,I'm on another level!
1663,1663,3,Mark,False,3,I've gone beyond!
1664,1664,3,Mark,False,5,"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."
1665,1665,3,Mark,False,5,I thought they would just…
1666,1666,3,Mark,False,7,What do you know about my shoes?
1667,1667,3,Mark,False,2,Don't go!
1668,1668,3,Mark,False,6,"Soph, you should stay and bowl!"
1669,1669,3,Mark,False,6,Bowl the night away with us!
1670,1670,3,Mark,False,16,"Once they get the stuff out, we can have a little tournament and it'll be fun!"
1671,1671,3,Mark,True,4,Don't think about it.
1672,1672,3,Mark,True,9,"If you don't think about it, it won't happen."
1673,1673,3,Mark,True,3,Straight to Frenching.
1674,1674,3,Mark,True,2,So easy.
1675,1675,3,Mark,True,13,I bet Sophie and Jeff are doing a lot of talking right now.
1676,1676,3,Mark,True,13,"Yeah, she can really talk, probably boring him rigid about the Celestine Prophecy."
1677,1677,3,Mark,True,15,"Maybe Jeff's bought loads of booze, Sophie could be pissed - too pissed to mind."
1678,1678,3,Mark,True,1,Ow!
1679,1679,3,Mark,True,5,She's squeezing my- don't complain!
1680,1680,3,Mark,True,7,She hasn't said anything about my nuts.
1681,1681,3,Mark,True,10,She's probably too young to know how weird they are.
1682,1682,3,Mark,True,7,I'm having sex with a teenage girl!
1683,1683,3,Mark,True,6,Sophie wouldn't... not with the seat-sniffer.
1684,1684,3,Mark,True,6,I mean we've got a connection.
1685,1685,3,Mark,True,4,This is not wrong.
1686,1686,3,Mark,True,7,Just try and memorise it for later.
1687,1687,3,Mark,True,5,"Mm, this could be nice."
1688,1688,3,Mark,True,5,"A nice, lovely neck rub."
1689,1689,3,Mark,True,3,She's strangling me!
1690,1690,3,Mark,True,5,She's trying to kill me!
1691,1691,3,Mark,False,2,I can't!
1692,1692,3,Mark,False,2,I can't!
1693,1693,3,Mark,False,3,"Jesus Valerie, w-what!"
1694,1694,3,Mark,False,9,Why didn't you say if you didn't like it?
1695,1695,3,Mark,False,3,"Thanks, thank you."
1696,1696,3,Mark,False,6,It was just the... not breathing.
1697,1697,3,Mark,False,2,You know.
1698,1698,3,Mark,False,8,"No problem, I'll be fine on the sofa."
1699,1699,3,Mark,False,6,Have you got everything you need?
1700,1700,3,Mark,False,10,Do you want me to leave the hall light on?
1701,1701,3,Mark,False,5,"No, right, sure, of course."
1702,1702,3,Mark,True,10,"God, she does look kind of great in my pyjamas."
1703,1703,3,Mark,True,2,That's sick.
1704,1704,3,Mark,True,4,Why is that sick?
1705,1705,3,Mark,False,6,"Valerie, I was thinking, the sofa…"
1706,1706,3,Mark,False,6,"So I was thinking, the sofa."
1707,1707,4,Mark,True,4,Don't screw this up.
1708,1708,4,Mark,True,3,No screw ups.
1709,1709,4,Mark,True,3,Got to impress.
1710,1710,4,Mark,False,3,"Uh, well, no."
1711,1711,4,Mark,True,2,"Oh, yes."
1712,1712,4,Mark,True,4,"Yeah, I like it."
1713,1713,4,Mark,True,1,Brilliant.
1714,1714,4,Mark,True,6,That is just so spot on.
1715,1715,4,Mark,False,1, Right.
1716,1716,4,Mark,False,3,"Absolutely, dead right!"
1717,1717,4,Mark,True,5,"Alan Johnson, I'm in love."
1718,1718,4,Mark,True,6,"I'm in love with you, Johnson."
1719,1719,4,Mark,False,5," Hi, come in, come in."
1720,1720,4,Mark,False,2," Good, thanks."
1721,1721,4,Mark,True,6,Ask her to go the bar.
1722,1722,4,Mark,True,7,Ask her to go to the bar!
1723,1723,4,Mark,False,1,Yeah
1724,1724,4,Mark,False,1, Yeah?
1725,1725,4,Mark,False,2," Right, well..."
1726,1726,4,Mark,False,5, I mean I could... help.
1727,1727,4,Mark,False,2, Oh yeah.
1728,1728,4,Mark,False,1,Totally.
1729,1729,4,Mark,False,1,Absolutely.
1730,1730,4,Mark,True,3,Dave's the saint.
1731,1731,4,Mark,True,4,Nothing must unseat Dave.
1732,1732,4,Mark,False,1, Soph.
1733,1733,4,Mark,False,3,"Honestly, it's fine."
1734,1734,4,Mark,False,2," OK, night."
1735,1735,4,Mark,True,8,"Go on, yes, I now what you're thinking."
1736,1736,4,Mark,True,10,"I'm shit, you're great, I'm the worm, you're the king."
1737,1737,4,Mark,True,9,"Yeah, well eat your nuts and go fuck yourself."
1738,1738,4,Mark,True,6,I only asked about the bus.
1739,1739,4,Mark,True,10,No need to make out I'm some kind of freak.
1740,1740,4,Mark,True,29,"Checking in to the hotel it's all ""Can we get you fresh whatever"" and once you're on the way out it's ""one of you is liable for the cashews."""
1741,1741,4,Mark,True,1,Sophie.
1742,1742,4,Mark,True,1,Jeff?
1743,1743,4,Mark,True,6,That fucking... What's the story there?
1744,1744,4,Mark,True,10,This is the worst thing to happen to anyone ever.
1745,1745,4,Mark,True,4,Oh my fucking life.
1746,1746,4,Mark,True,3,It's Alan Johnson.
1747,1747,4,Mark,False,4," Yes, yes it is."
1748,1748,4,Mark,False,2,It's Mark.
1749,1749,4,Mark,False,6, Oh I would love a lift.
1750,1750,4,Mark,True,1,Shit!
1751,1751,4,Mark,True,10,This is the best thing that's happened to anyone ever.
1752,1752,4,Mark,True,3,Look at me.
1753,1753,4,Mark,True,15,"Friends with a big, black businessman like it's the most natural thing in the world."
1754,1754,4,Mark,True,16,"If he got accused of a crime he hadn't committed, I could come to his aid."
1755,1755,4,Mark,False,1, Jez?
1756,1756,4,Mark,False,2," Er, yes."
1757,1757,4,Mark,False,1,Ehhh!
1758,1758,4,Mark,False,1,Ehhh!
1759,1759,4,Mark,False,5," Jez, are you all right?"
1760,1760,4,Mark,False,1, Right.
1761,1761,4,Mark,False,6,"That's very nice and everything, Jez."
1762,1762,4,Mark,False,5,I should open some wine.
1763,1763,4,Mark,False,10,I've actually got rather a good friend coming over later.
1764,1764,4,Mark,False,3, I totally agree.
1765,1765,4,Mark,False,4,I couldn't agree more.
1766,1766,4,Mark,False,2, It's pathetic.
1767,1767,4,Mark,True,2,Oh God!
1768,1768,4,Mark,True,5,Not in front of Johnson.
1769,1769,4,Mark,False,15," So if you like, I'll show you what I've done so far on the book."
1770,1770,4,Mark,False,5,Business Secrets of the Pharaohs?
1771,1771,4,Mark,False,11,It's only the opening chapter but it gives a flavour of...
1772,1772,4,Mark,False,4, It doesn't seem to...
1773,1773,4,Mark,False,6," No, but it wasn't working when…"
1774,1774,4,Mark,True,6,"Me and Johnson, Johnson and me."
1775,1775,4,Mark,True,6,We only met a fortnight ago.
1776,1776,4,Mark,True,4,Everything's happening so fast!
1777,1777,4,Mark,False,2,That sounds...
1778,1778,4,Mark,False,6,I don't know what to say.
1779,1779,4,Mark,False,3,That sounds amazing.
1780,1780,4,Mark,False,5," Yeah, but the relocation thing."
1781,1781,4,Mark,False,4,Moving out on Jeremy.
1782,1782,4,Mark,False,6,"It feels a bit weird, Dad."
1783,1783,4,Mark,True,1,Shit!
1784,1784,4,Mark,False,4, It feels weird... Daddy-O.
1785,1785,4,Mark,True,2,Good save
1786,1786,4,Mark,False,6," Well, nowadays, email and so forth."
1787,1787,4,Mark,False,8,Do I really need to move to Cardiff?
1788,1788,4,Mark,False,1, Uh-huh.
1789,1789,4,Mark,False,1,Interesting.
1790,1790,4,Mark,True,4,I've got tell him.
1791,1791,4,Mark,True,7,How am I going to tell him?
1792,1792,4,Mark,True,4,"Oh, this is horrible."
1793,1793,4,Mark,True,5,"He might crumble, he's weak."
1794,1794,4,Mark,True,3,Remember the Johnson.
1795,1795,4,Mark,False,2,Hey Jez!
1796,1796,4,Mark,False,8," So, what do you make of this place?"
1797,1797,4,Mark,False,10,You just choose whatever you want from the revolving belt.
1798,1798,4,Mark,False,5, Johnson told me about it.
1799,1799,4,Mark,False,7,"Apparently, according to Johnson, wasabi sauce is…"
1800,1800,4,Mark,False,9, Where did this come from all of a sudden?
1801,1801,4,Mark,False,1, Jeremy!
1802,1802,4,Mark,False,14,"Look, I've got nothing against... being gay, but I'm not and neither is Johnson."
1803,1803,4,Mark,False,12,"He's black, in case you hadn't noticed, which I expect you had."
1804,1804,4,Mark,True,1,Jesus!
1805,1805,4,Mark,True,16,I'm probably just the sort of person who'd be gay and repress it even to himself.
1806,1806,4,Mark,False,18,"The thing is, well, there's no easy way to put this but Johnson's invited me in with him."
1807,1807,4,Mark,False,11,"He wants me to get into bed, team up with him."
1808,1808,4,Mark,False,6,It would mean relocating to Cardiff.
1809,1809,4,Mark,False,11," Look, I really feel I need to go for this, Jez."
1810,1810,4,Mark,False,10,"Look, it not as if it's the end for us."
1811,1811,4,Mark,False,6,We're still the El Dude Brothers.
1812,1812,4,Mark,False,7,We'll always be the El Dude Brothers.
1813,1813,4,Mark,False,3,It's just that...
1814,1814,4,Mark,False,2,I'm leaving.
1815,1815,4,Mark,False,10,I can't spend my life with you at base camp.
1816,1816,4,Mark,True,2,He's cracked.
1817,1817,4,Mark,True,7,I hope he doesn't do anything drastic.
1818,1818,4,Mark,True,22,"If he hangs himself over this, I could put an orange in his mouth and say it was a fatal wanking accident."
1819,1819,4,Mark,False,10," I'm so glad you came here for a follow-up, man."
1820,1820,4,Mark,False,9,You totally blew apart Barbara's stone age business paradigm.
1821,1821,4,Mark,True,5,Maybe I do fancy him?
1822,1822,4,Mark,True,10,"He's handsome, not in a gay way, it's just obvious."
1823,1823,4,Mark,True,4,He's a good-looking guy.
1824,1824,4,Mark,True,3,A guy's guy.
1825,1825,4,Mark,True,3,But would I?
1826,1826,4,Mark,False,1, Sophie!
1827,1827,4,Mark,False,3,"Sophie, Sophie, Sophie!"
1828,1828,4,Mark,False,5,"You know Alan, of course."
1829,1829,4,Mark,False,12," You've got to admit, Soph, she was asking a lot of questions."
1830,1830,4,Mark,False,2, See you.
1831,1831,4,Mark,True,16,I do want to be with him all the time... but could I think about kissing?
1832,1832,4,Mark,True,5,Well I'm thinking about it.
1833,1833,4,Mark,True,10,"No I'm not, I'm just thinking about thinking about it."
1834,1834,4,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, she's very... yeah, I could have a little thing going there with Sophie, actually."
1835,1835,4,Mark,False,1, Yeah?
1836,1836,4,Mark,False,1, Er...
1837,1837,4,Mark,False,1, She's...
1838,1838,4,Mark,False,5,I think she's very pretty.
1839,1839,4,Mark,False,12," Well she's... Maybe it is a bit... nice, but in a sense..."
1840,1840,4,Mark,True,2,Oh yes!
1841,1841,4,Mark,True,5,"Take me Johnson, I'm yours!"
1842,1842,4,Mark,True,10,There's probably much less to worry about with gay sex.
1843,1843,4,Mark,True,10,I mean you know where you are with a cock.
1844,1844,4,Mark,True,8,"Still, even if I am gay, Johnson isn't."
1845,1845,4,Mark,True,13,"I mean it's going to be hard enough turning me gay, let alone…"
1846,1846,4,Mark,True,5,"OK, listen to the Johnson."
1847,1847,4,Mark,False,1,Heh.
1848,1848,4,Mark,True,3,"Yes, take that!"
1849,1849,4,Mark,False,3," Oh, you know."
1850,1850,4,Mark,True,3,"Stay strong, brother."
1851,1851,4,Mark,False,4," Didn't faze me, sweetheart."
1852,1852,4,Mark,True,7,That was probably a bit too much.
1853,1853,4,Mark,False,2, Yeah whatever.
1854,1854,4,Mark,True,6,"That's all very possible, totally possible."
1855,1855,4,Mark,True,2,Don't weaken.
1856,1856,4,Mark,False,3,"No, no, why?"
1857,1857,4,Mark,True,3,This is ridiculous.
1858,1858,4,Mark,True,7,"She's beautiful, I'm not gay, forget Johnson!"
1859,1859,4,Mark,True,3,Go for it!
1860,1860,4,Mark,False,4," Fine, no it's fine."
1861,1861,4,Mark,False,4,"Just nothing, a bump."
1862,1862,4,Mark,True,7,"It's staring you in the face, Mark."
1863,1863,4,Mark,True,7,There's only one other sex to try.
1864,1864,4,Mark,True,5,Good old unfriendly Mr Patel.
1865,1865,4,Mark,True,13,"Never says a word... whether you're buying cornflakes, fabric softener, or gay porn."
1866,1866,4,Mark,True,7,"So here we go, watch without prejudice."
1867,1867,4,Mark,True,5,I'm just testing the water.
1868,1868,4,Mark,True,4,I'm a sexual scientist.
1869,1869,4,Mark,True,5,So I'm keeping in trim.
1870,1870,4,Mark,True,3,This is fine.
1871,1871,4,Mark,True,7,"Typical evening in, Johnson's doing the spreadsheet."
1872,1872,4,Mark,True,6,There's nothing to be afraid of.
1873,1873,4,Mark,True,13,It was very popular with the Romans and they got a lot done.
1874,1874,4,Mark,True,4,How's it going Johnson?
1875,1875,4,Mark,True,3,"Haha, so quick."
1876,1876,4,Mark,True,4,"Yeah, some good kissing."
1877,1877,4,Mark,True,4,Maybe I'm just bi-curious?
1878,1878,4,Mark,True,11,"What if that was actually Johnson, would that make me hotter?"
1879,1879,4,Mark,True,7,What about if he had Sophie's face?
1880,1880,4,Mark,True,6,Or Sophie body with Johnson's face.
1881,1881,4,Mark,True,4,"Mum, dad, I'm bi-curious."
1882,1882,4,Mark,True,4,"Yeah right, the bum."
1883,1883,4,Mark,True,5,Nothing wrong with the bum.
1884,1884,4,Mark,True,1,Ah!
1885,1885,4,Mark,True,7,That's a bit too rich for me!
1886,1886,4,Mark,True,4,I just don't know!
1887,1887,4,Mark,False,13," No, it's a rhetorical question, you know, like ""Can you feel The Force?"""
1888,1888,4,Mark,False,6,"or ""Do they know it's Christmas?"""
1889,1889,4,Mark,False,16, I really need to pick up my laptop from the IT guy before Johnson gets here.
1890,1890,4,Mark,False,1, What?
1891,1891,4,Mark,False,26," No, he forgot the keys after the pub and then he called to put me in charge of the keys until such a time he reclaims the keys."
1892,1892,4,Mark,False,4, What if something happened?
1893,1893,4,Mark,False,5, You're insured on any car?
1894,1894,4,Mark,False,3," No, absolutely not!"
1895,1895,4,Mark,False,7,We're almost at the office now and…
1896,1896,4,Mark,False,1, No.
1897,1897,4,Mark,False,3," God, Jeremy, no!"
1898,1898,4,Mark,False,1,God!
1899,1899,4,Mark,False,4,That was Mica from...
1900,1900,4,Mark,False,6,I hope they didn't recognise me!
1901,1901,4,Mark,False,3, Of course not!
1902,1902,4,Mark,False,7,Sometimes he lets me do the gears.
1903,1903,4,Mark,False,4, This doesn't feel right.
1904,1904,4,Mark,False,4, But I can't drive.
1905,1905,4,Mark,False,1,Oh.
1906,1906,4,Mark,False,1,My.
1907,1907,4,Mark,False,1,God.
1908,1908,4,Mark,False,3," OK. OK, OK!"
1909,1909,4,Mark,False,4,Look at me go!
1910,1910,4,Mark,False,2,I'm driving!
1911,1911,4,Mark,False,5,"Look at me driving, Jez!"
1912,1912,4,Mark,False,5," Yeah, oh yeah, come on!"
1913,1913,4,Mark,False,2,I'm driving.
1914,1914,4,Mark,False,2,I'm Johnson.
1915,1915,4,Mark,False,3,Driving is bullshit!
1916,1916,4,Mark,False,2,I'm Johnson!
1917,1917,4,Mark,False,3, Right is bollocks.
1918,1918,4,Mark,False,3,I'm going rogue.
1919,1919,4,Mark,False,1, Jesus.
1920,1920,4,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, h-how do I er…"
1921,1921,4,Mark,False,5, How do I do stopping?
1922,1922,4,Mark,False,1, What?
1923,1923,4,Mark,False,3,This old banger?
1924,1924,4,Mark,False,13," Yeah, and you'd probably like a spin, but we're just tooling around town."
1925,1925,4,Mark,False,6,"You know, it's a guy thing."
1926,1926,4,Mark,False,3," It's cool, Jez."
1927,1927,4,Mark,False,4,"See you around, Soph."
1928,1928,4,Mark,False,2,"Oh, Jesus."
1929,1929,4,Mark,False,7, You've got to help me out here.
1930,1930,4,Mark,False,8," Look, Jez, you've got to take the rap."
1931,1931,4,Mark,False,7,"I mean, you don't have to but..."
1932,1932,4,Mark,False,11,"I have a future whereas you... not don't, just, it's different!"
1933,1933,4,Mark,False,2, True mates.
1934,1934,4,Mark,False,1, Uhhh!
1935,1935,4,Mark,False,3,Johnson is here!
1936,1936,4,Mark,False,3,Johnson is here!
1937,1937,4,Mark,False,5,You're such a good guy.
1938,1938,4,Mark,True,8,We'll be in Cardiff together within the fortnight.
1939,1939,4,Mark,True,2,"Relax, Mark."
1940,1940,4,Mark,True,3,Business before pleasure.
1941,1941,4,Mark,False,3," Alan, come in."
1942,1942,4,Mark,False,6,I'm afraid something terrible has happened.
1943,1943,4,Mark,False,10," I mean, he says ""borrowed"", but really I had no..."
1944,1944,4,Mark,False,4," Jeremy, for God's sake!"
1945,1945,4,Mark,False,2, Love you?!
1946,1946,4,Mark,False,3,Of course not!
1947,1947,4,Mark,False,1,No!
1948,1948,4,Mark,False,5,"Yes yes, maybe a bit."
1949,1949,4,Mark,False,4,"I do possibly, somewhat."
1950,1950,4,Mark,False,7,"But Alan, it's not how it seems."
1951,1951,4,Mark,False,5,I'm 85% sure I'm straight.
1952,1952,4,Mark,False,40,"It's just I do have feelings for you and, in principle, I'm not against more... it's just, I don't think I'll know till it's right there in front of me, whether I'll be able to go through with it, OK?"
1953,1953,4,Mark,False,6, I just don't know any more!
1954,1954,4,Mark,True,2,Not this.
1955,1955,4,Mark,True,4,I don't want this.
1956,1956,4,Mark,True,2,Not now.
1957,1957,4,Mark,True,3,I'm not gay.
1958,1958,4,Mark,True,5,"Possibly bi, but basically uncurious."
1959,1959,5,Mark,True,13,"If I get promoted to loan supervisor, that's an extra 160 a month."
1960,1960,5,Mark,True,6,Four months - weekend in Zurich.
1961,1961,5,Mark,True,4,If I get it.
1962,1962,5,Mark,True,11,I should've ironed my... why didn't I iron my fucking tie?

1967,1967,5,Mark,True,3,Lovely soft face.
1968,1968,5,Mark,False,2, You're right.
1969,1969,5,Mark,False,2,Totally right.
1970,1970,5,Mark,False,2,A laugh.
1971,1971,5,Mark,False,4,Have a nice laugh.
1972,1972,5,Mark,False,11,Do you think Jeff's charity squash stuff's gonna count for much?
1973,1973,5,Mark,True,1,Oohhh...
1974,1974,5,Mark,False,7,"Sophie, have you ever been to Zurich?"
1975,1975,5,Mark,True,2,Too much!
1976,1976,5,Mark,True,2,Too much!
1977,1977,5,Mark,False,3,"Very clean, apparently."
1978,1978,5,Mark,False,2,Ruthlessly clean.
1979,1979,5,Mark,False,5,"Talking of which, badminton round-robin."
1980,1980,5,Mark,False,5,You still on for Wednesday?
1981,1981,5,Mark,False,5," And I was thinking, afterwards…"
1982,1982,5,Mark,True,8,"Forget it mate, you're dead in the water."
1983,1983,5,Mark,True,8,I'm going to be relaxing all over you.
1984,1984,5,Mark,True,5,The interview went really well.
1985,1985,5,Mark,True,6,Glad I didn't mention the phones.
1986,1986,5,Mark,True,8,Keep the big idea on ice for now.
1987,1987,5,Mark,True,7,Maybe I should've mentioned the blind kids.
1988,1988,5,Mark,True,12,Although I could've sounded like I just did it for my CV.
1989,1989,5,Mark,True,10,I definitely did not do that just for my CV.
1990,1990,5,Mark,False,2, Hey Sophie!
1991,1991,5,Mark,False,7, What's... they didn't give it to Jeff?
1992,1992,5,Mark,False,1,YES!
1993,1993,5,Mark,False,1,!
1994,1994,5,Mark,False,7, Is this... is this a funny joke?
1995,1995,5,Mark,False,5," Well good, that's really good."
1996,1996,5,Mark,False,8,"Great, well I'll just get on with these."
1997,1997,5,Mark,False,3, It doesn't matter!
1998,1998,5,Mark,False,3,It doesn't matter!
1999,1999,5,Mark,False,3,So what happened?
2000,2000,5,Mark,False,1,Congratulations.
2001,2001,5,Mark,False,4,What the hell happened?
2002,2002,5,Mark,False,2," Sure, sure."
2003,2003,5,Mark,False,4,What's the real deal?
2004,2004,5,Mark,False,6,What's the story behind the story?
2005,2005,5,Mark,False,22," No, I mean you know, you know how I think of you but, you've got to say I'm the better loan manager."
2006,2006,5,Mark,False,1,Right?
2007,2007,5,Mark,False,5,You've got to say that.
2008,2008,5,Mark,False,7," You've got to say that, haven't you?"
2009,2009,5,Mark,False,3," Well, thanks boss."
2010,2010,5,Mark,False,2," Yeah, right."
2011,2011,5,Mark,False,2, You're serious?
2012,2012,5,Mark,False,2," No, totally."
2013,2013,5,Mark,False,2,That's fine.

2016,2016,5,Mark,False,1,Fine.
2017,2017,5,Mark,True,26,And if you could just dance a death clog dance all over my hopes and dreams and leave a girl turd in my happy place… Shit!
2018,2018,5,Mark,True,6,I should've milked those blindies dry!
2019,2019,5,Mark,False,1, Sorry.
2020,2020,5,Mark,True,2,"Yeah, sorry."
2021,2021,5,Mark,True,4,"You'll be sorry, bitch."
2022,2022,5,Mark,True,3,What a horrible...
2023,2023,5,Mark,True,4,I couldn't hate her!
2024,2024,5,Mark,True,12,Why oh why oh why didn't I tell them the phones thing?!
2025,2025,5,Mark,True,4,The phones thing rocks!
2026,2026,5,Mark,True,7,"Sophie, climbing over my dead body to..."
2027,2027,5,Mark,True,8,"It's not her fault, she doesn't even realise."
2028,2028,5,Mark,True,4,She's just a stooge.
2029,2029,5,Mark,True,8,"A beautiful, stupid, ugly, shitting, filthy grasping stooge!"
2030,2030,5,Mark,False,1, Ha!
2031,2031,5,Mark,True,7,"Hey, come on Mark, keep it real."
2032,2032,5,Mark,True,5,Don't let this ruin things.
2033,2033,5,Mark,True,22,"Besides, once you're going steady, you can grind her down, put her handbag in the fridge and tell her she's going mad."
2034,2034,5,Mark,False,3,Ha ha ha!
2035,2035,5,Mark,False,2," Nothing, sorry."
2036,2036,5,Mark,False,2,Good shot.
2037,2037,5,Mark,True,4,It's just a game.
2038,2038,5,Mark,True,3,A grown-up game.
2039,2039,5,Mark,True,6,"Mousetrap, Downfall, Hunt the Yorkshire Ripper..."
2040,2040,5,Mark,True,4,It's not her fault!
2041,2041,5,Mark,True,7,Why didn't I mention the fucking phones?!
2042,2042,5,Mark,True,1,!
2043,2043,5,Mark,False,1, What?
2044,2044,5,Mark,False,7, I thought we were going for dinner!
2045,2045,5,Mark,False,4, I though we said.
2046,2046,5,Mark,False,3, The whole team?
2047,2047,5,Mark,False,2,The team.
2048,2048,5,Mark,False,2, It's fine.
2049,2049,5,Mark,True,3,It's all fine.
2050,2050,5,Mark,True,3,Everything is clear.
2051,2051,5,Mark,True,3,I love her.
2052,2052,5,Mark,True,6,She is going to kill me.
2053,2053,5,Mark,False,4,It's all totally fine.
2054,2054,5,Mark,False,1, Uh-huh.
2055,2055,5,Mark,True,6,You can never go home again.
2056,2056,5,Mark,True,2,Winter's coming.
2057,2057,5,Mark,True,3,Is this Stalingrad?
2058,2058,5,Mark,True,6,Is this where it all ends?
2059,2059,5,Mark,True,7,Or is this... where it all starts!
2060,2060,5,Mark,True,5,This is a good idea.
2061,2061,5,Mark,True,5,This is a great idea!
2062,2062,5,Mark,True,16,It's exactly the sort of thing they're looking for and it's exactly what they're not expecting!
2063,2063,5,Mark,True,3,Just do it!
2064,2064,5,Mark,False,4," Alan, Mike, Barbara!"
2065,2065,5,Mark,False,8,Hope you don't mind if I butt in.
2066,2066,5,Mark,False,13," Don't worry, I'm not going to tuck in courtesy of the expense account."
2067,2067,5,Mark,False,18,I just thought this might be a good opportunity for me to share with you my vision of…
2068,2068,5,Mark,False,6, Can JLB's future wait till tomorrow?
2069,2069,5,Mark,False,27,"I don't think so, and I think you'll agree when you hear the great idea that I was just too darn frigging scared to spill at interview."
2070,2070,5,Mark,False,3, Reroute the phones!
2071,2071,5,Mark,True,6,This was definitely a good idea.
2072,2072,5,Mark,False,3,Simple as that!
2073,2073,5,Mark,False,6,Reroute the phones to everyone's mobiles.
2074,2074,5,Mark,False,9,"Twenty-four hour, face-to-face, round the clock customer freakin' service!"
2075,2075,5,Mark,False,10,"It's like ""Hey I'm clocking off, finger to the customer!"""
2076,2076,5,Mark,False,4,Well not anymore because…
2077,2077,5,Mark,False,6, But I've worked with blind kids!
2078,2078,5,Mark,False,4,I'm the full package!
2079,2079,5,Mark,False,3,Think about it.
2080,2080,5,Mark,False,13,I'll have my action plan on you desk first thing in the morning.
2081,2081,5,Mark,True,6,This was definitely a good idea.
2082,2082,5,Mark,True,8,There's no chance this wasn't a good idea.
2083,2083,5,Mark,False,2, Hey Jeremy.
2084,2084,5,Mark,False,6," Oh good, I'm feeling pretty good."
2085,2085,5,Mark,False,26," The way I see it now, Barbara is an experienced man-manager and if she thinks Sophie's right for the job, then Sophie's right for the job."
2086,2086,5,Mark,True,10,"Hey Barbara, thought we should have a follow-up meeting re."
2087,2087,5,Mark,True,3,the phones thing.
2088,2088,5,Mark,True,1,Oh!
2089,2089,5,Mark,True,3,You're not here!
2090,2090,5,Mark,True,17,"Well, I'll just leave my new idea in your desk, give you time to think about it."
2091,2091,5,Mark,True,7,"Yeah, so my new idea is urine."
2092,2092,5,Mark,True,8,Loads and loads of urine flooding your drawers.
2093,2093,5,Mark,True,6,What do you think about that?
2094,2094,5,Mark,True,9,"Don't you think that would be ""just the ticket""?"
2095,2095,5,Mark,True,5,"Yeah, you're getting some too."
2096,2096,5,Mark,False,5," JLB Credit, fuck off please!"
2097,2097,5,Mark,True,1,What?
2098,2098,5,Mark,True,2,From Sophie?
2099,2099,5,Mark,True,6,Application letter to... she did it.
2100,2100,5,Mark,True,3,She stiffed me.
2101,2101,5,Mark,True,16,"Well, Sophie's drawer's getting a dousing too, or I could park a turd on her desk."
2102,2102,5,Mark,True,2,Bit freaky.
2103,2103,5,Mark,True,5,Pissing's OK. Pissing's just horseplay.
2104,2104,5,Mark,True,3,Oh my God!
2105,2105,5,Mark,True,2,Oh no!
2106,2106,5,Mark,True,4,I didn't do it!
2107,2107,5,Mark,True,4,It's not my piss!
2108,2108,5,Mark,True,4,It was a joke!
2109,2109,5,Mark,True,7,She did it to me last week.
2110,2110,5,Mark,True,1,SHIT!
2111,2111,5,Mark,True,1,!
2112,2112,5,Mark,False,1, Sophie?
2113,2113,5,Mark,False,7,I didn't realise you were still here.
2114,2114,5,Mark,False,3," Oh, just likewise."
2115,2115,5,Mark,False,2,Working late.
2116,2116,5,Mark,False,5,Left a file here somewhere.
2117,2117,5,Mark,True,4,Don't notice the piss.
2118,2118,5,Mark,True,4,Don't notice the piss.
2119,2119,5,Mark,False,2," Yeah, totally"
2120,2120,5,Mark,False,7," Oh, let me get those for you."
2121,2121,5,Mark,False,2, Better not.
2122,2122,5,Mark,False,1,Thanks.
2123,2123,5,Mark,False,5,Got a lot to do.
2124,2124,5,Mark,False,1,Thanks.
2125,2125,5,Mark,True,12,"Yeah, I've gotta take the letter-shaped knife out of my back, Judas!"
2126,2126,5,Mark,True,7,"OK, they're a bit crinkled, so what?"
2127,2127,5,Mark,True,2,"Hello, police?"
2128,2128,5,Mark,True,11,Someone broke into my office and crinkled my papers and stuff.
2129,2129,5,Mark,True,3,I think not.
2130,2130,5,Mark,False,1, Sophie?
2131,2131,5,Mark,False,3, It's not piss!
2132,2132,5,Mark,False,8," But mainly, you're a careers guidance counsellor, right?"
2133,2133,5,Mark,False,10,"I mean, I just want to make it absolutely clear."
2134,2134,5,Mark,False,7,"I'm here for careers guidance, not therapy."
2135,2135,5,Mark,False,6, What are you trying to say?
2136,2136,5,Mark,False,17," Look, I don't want to talk about any difficult feelings I may or may not be experiencing"
2137,2137,5,Mark,False,3, Is it therapy?
2138,2138,5,Mark,True,5,He's trying to therapise me
2139,2139,5,Mark,True,2,Snake pit.
2140,2140,5,Mark,False,2,Snake... charmer.
2141,2141,5,Mark,True,1,Everything.
2142,2142,5,Mark,False,2,Not everything.
2143,2143,5,Mark,True,1,Blind.
2144,2144,5,Mark,False,2,"Er, short."
2145,2145,5,Mark,True,1,Fuhrer.
2146,2146,5,Mark,False,1,Football.
2147,2147,5,Mark,True,1,Sophie.
2148,2148,5,Mark,False,1,Fuck!
2149,2149,5,Mark,False,3,"No, not ""fuck."""
2150,2150,5,Mark,False,6, Can I change any of those?
2151,2151,5,Mark,False,5,What score did I get?
2152,2152,5,Mark,False,5,"It wasn't good, was it?"
2153,2153,5,Mark,False,1, Right.
2154,2154,5,Mark,False,3,Sure you don't.
2155,2155,5,Mark,True,3,A hairy twat.
2156,2156,5,Mark,True,4,"A hungry, devouring twat."
2157,2157,5,Mark,False,2,A kitten?
2158,2158,5,Mark,False,4, They think I'm ill.
2159,2159,5,Mark,False,14,I'm screwing the system and there's not a thing they can do about it.
2160,2160,5,Mark,False,3,Sophie's gonna pay.
2161,2161,5,Mark,False,4,She'll pay all right.
2162,2162,5,Mark,False,1, Exactly!
2163,2163,5,Mark,False,5, It's political correctness gone mad.
2164,2164,5,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy, have you seen Strangers On A Train?"
2165,2165,5,Mark,False,12, It's about these two guys who take care of each other's enemies.
2166,2166,5,Mark,False,13," I can't remember, but I'm pretty sure it all turns out all right."
2167,2167,5,Mark,False,4, This is the ultimate.
2168,2168,5,Mark,False,7," Yeah, so what are you gonna say?"
2169,2169,5,Mark,False,1, No!
2170,2170,5,Mark,False,1,You...!
2171,2171,5,Mark,False,3,Don't say that!
2172,2172,5,Mark,False,3,"Jesus, that's horrible!"
2173,2173,5,Mark,False,10,"Just say something like... ask ""is Mrs Hugh Jass there""."
2174,2174,5,Mark,False,4,"No, no, not that."
2175,2175,5,Mark,False,7,She's got a thing about her bum.
2176,2176,5,Mark,False,4,How about Mike Hunt?
2177,2177,5,Mark,False,2,"No, no."
2178,2178,5,Mark,False,1, Shit!
2179,2179,5,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy, she's got a fucking air gun!"
2180,2180,5,Mark,False,2," Oh, God!"
2181,2181,5,Mark,False,1,Jesus!
2182,2182,5,Mark,False,8,"Mother... Bollocks, that kills, that hurts SO MUCH!"
2183,2183,5,Mark,True,4,Why not come clean?
2184,2184,5,Mark,True,18,"You can say... you could say... nope, there is no possible way of making this look- Oh FUCK!"
2185,2185,5,Mark,False,10," Yeah, I suppose everything turned out pretty much all right."
2186,2186,5,Mark,True,24,"I've made a psycho call to the woman I love, I've kicked a dog to death, and now I'm going to pepper-spray an acquaintance."
2187,2187,5,Mark,True,1,Something...
2188,2188,5,Mark,True,6,"I mean, what's happened to me?"
2189,2189,5,Mark,False,4," Yeah, no, it's fine."
2190,2190,5,Mark,False,3,I'm on it.
2191,2191,5,Mark,False,25," I give Super Hans the pizza, pepper-spray him, then kick him in the nuts and grab his wallet to make it look like a robbery."
2192,2192,5,Mark,True,4,What am I doing?
2193,2193,5,Mark,True,4,I can't do this!
2194,2194,5,Mark,True,7,There's no way I can do this!
2195,2195,5,Mark,False,3,There's no pizza.
2196,2196,5,Mark,False,3,"It's me, Mark."
2197,2197,5,Mark,False,16,I've been sent to pepper-spray Super Hans and kick him in the nuts but I can't.
2198,2198,5,Mark,False,4,"I can't, all right?"
2199,2199,5,Mark,False,8,It's all gone over the edge of reason.
2200,2200,5,Mark,False,13," Look, it would really help me if you could start screaming, a bit."
2201,2201,5,Mark,False,9," Yeah, and if you could tell Jeremy that I…"
2202,2202,5,Mark,False,3," Jeremy, that's enough!"
2203,2203,5,Mark,False,5,"Jez, there's no need to…"
2204,2204,5,Mark,False,5, It's for your own good!
2205,2205,5,Mark,False,4," OK, enough careers guidance."
2206,2206,5,Mark,False,3,I need therapy.
2207,2207,5,Mark,False,10," Look, I don't want to talk about it any more."
2208,2208,5,Mark,False,10,You didn't kick him in the nuts - that's something.
2209,2209,5,Mark,False,5,You can build on that.
2210,2210,5,Mark,False,4,The spray's gone Jeremy.
2211,2211,5,Mark,False,12," Look, Mr Klugman has a little mantra that I'm finding very helpful."
2212,2212,5,Mark,False,3,Heal and grow.
2213,2213,5,Mark,False,16,Not to be patronising but perhaps you want to have a really good think about that.
2214,2214,5,Mark,False,1, Sophie?
2215,2215,5,Mark,True,3,Heal and grow.
2216,2216,5,Mark,True,3,Heal and grow.
2217,2217,5,Mark,False,4,Good to see you.
2218,2218,5,Mark,False,2,Come in.
2219,2219,5,Mark,False,8, I've been feeling a little low lately but…
2220,2220,5,Mark,False,2," Oh, that."
2221,2221,5,Mark,False,2,That's nothing.
2222,2222,5,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy just hit me, with the ladle."
2223,2223,5,Mark,False,4," Sophie, Sophie, Sophie, relax."
2224,2224,5,Mark,False,2,I'm fine.
2225,2225,5,Mark,False,3,Life is fine.
2226,2226,5,Mark,True,3,"Cool, wet grass."
2227,2227,5,Mark,True,3,"Cool, wet grass."
2228,2228,5,Mark,False,3,I'm having therapy.
2229,2229,5,Mark,False,5,I'm going to the solarium.
2230,2230,5,Mark,False,8,I have spoken with the Citizens Advice Bureau.
2231,2231,5,Mark,False,5,There's nothing inside killing me.
2232,2232,5,Mark,True,2,Lying bitch!
2233,2233,5,Mark,True,2,NOT bitch.
2234,2234,5,Mark,False,4,"It's fine, fine, fine."
2235,2235,5,Mark,False,7,I've let go of all that stuff.
2236,2236,5,Mark,False,1, Totally.
2237,2237,5,Mark,False,1, Ahh.
2238,2238,5,Mark,False,1,Right.
2239,2239,5,Mark,True,6,"Jesus, so she didn't... Oh God!"
2240,2240,5,Mark,True,4,I'm such a cockmuncher!
2241,2241,5,Mark,True,3,"No, NOT cockmuncher."
2242,2242,5,Mark,False,2, Your team?
2243,2243,5,Mark,True,3,Heal and grow!
2244,2244,5,Mark,True,3,Heal and grow!
2245,2245,5,Mark,False,20,"Well, I guess it's very nice for the big lady to come down here and talk to the little man."
2246,2246,5,Mark,False,17,I'm just surprised you can see me from all the way up there in your ivory tower.
2247,2247,5,Mark,False,1, Sophie!
2248,2248,5,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
2249,2249,5,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
2250,2250,5,Mark,False,2,Don't go!
2251,2251,5,Mark,False,2,"Sophie, I..."
2252,2252,6,Mark,False,12, Plus it was so cold and wet and boring in the outfield.
2253,2253,6,Mark,False,15,"I mean personally, I don't think I've ever seen a ball that slippery, have you?"
2254,2254,6,Mark,True,3,This is it.
2255,2255,6,Mark,True,4,All systems are go.
2256,2256,6,Mark,True,9,"The apple is ripe, the cross hairs are centralised."
2257,2257,6,Mark,False,9,"Soph, I was wondering, do you like Indonesian food?"
2258,2258,6,Mark,True,3,It's too much.
2259,2259,6,Mark,True,3,I'm not American.
2260,2260,6,Mark,True,3,I can't date.
2261,2261,6,Mark,True,4,Restaurant on a barge?
2262,2262,6,Mark,True,9,I might as well ask her to marry me.
2263,2263,6,Mark,True,2,The pub.
2264,2264,6,Mark,True,4,That's the English way.
2265,2265,6,Mark,False,3, Oh just... nothing.
2266,2266,6,Mark,False,7,"But listen, everyone's going to the pub."
2267,2267,6,Mark,False,3,You want to...?
2268,2268,6,Mark,True,6," Oh, no, no, not at all."
2269,2269,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, my God."
2270,2270,6,Mark,False,5,She's taking off her top.
2271,2271,6,Mark,False,4,This is very promising.
2272,2272,6,Mark,False,3,Or is it?
2273,2273,6,Mark,False,8,Would she do this if she fancied me?
2274,2274,6,Mark,False,10,"Maybe we're... oh, God, no, no, we're only bloody friends!"
2275,2275,6,Mark,False,10, And then she gave me a peck on the cheek.
2276,2276,6,Mark,False,4,It's a living nightmare!
2277,2277,6,Mark,False,16," I've got to close the deal, I've gotta ask her out without actually asking her out."
2278,2278,6,Mark,False,11,"One step forward, two steps back, that's the key to progress."
2279,2279,6,Mark,False,5, So how was your day?
2280,2280,6,Mark,False,1, Yeah?
2281,2281,6,Mark,False,3,Is it serious?
2282,2282,6,Mark,False,1, Hospice?
2283,2283,6,Mark,False,10,"You... Jez, you know what a hospice is, don't you?"
2284,2284,6,Mark,False,11, A hospice is where people go to... who are terminally ill.
2285,2285,6,Mark,False,8," Well, I have to say, probably not mate."
2286,2286,6,Mark,False,2,Probably not.
2287,2287,6,Mark,False,8, Have you thought about giving him a call?
2288,2288,6,Mark,False,10," I don't know, I think maybe you should call him."
2289,2289,6,Mark,False,10," So, Ray, Jez tells me you worked on the force."
2290,2290,6,Mark,False,1, Blimey.
2291,2291,6,Mark,False,13,"So must be nice, getting a bit of support from your police mates."
2292,2292,6,Mark,False,2,The force.
2293,2293,6,Mark,False,7,"You can trust the force, can't you?"
2294,2294,6,Mark,False,12," People can be so funny when it comes to illness, can't they?"
2295,2295,6,Mark,False,8,"I mean, it's good that you... you know…"
2296,2296,6,Mark,False,10," Yeah, that's really a great thing to have, a faith."
2297,2297,6,Mark,False,2, Has it...?
2298,2298,6,Mark,False,1,is...?
2299,2299,6,Mark,False,4," Oh, man, I'm sorry."
2300,2300,6,Mark,False,4, Shall I turn over?
2301,2301,6,Mark,False,4, That's a nice idea.
2302,2302,6,Mark,True,2,It's perfect.
2303,2303,6,Mark,True,6,Big social occasion but no invites.
2304,2304,6,Mark,True,7,"It's not a date, but it is."
2305,2305,6,Mark,True,7,"What if it all goes right, though?"
2306,2306,6,Mark,True,9,"What do I do about my massive, freakish balls?"
2307,2307,6,Mark,True,5,Don't get ahead of yourself.
2308,2308,6,Mark,False,2," Hey, Soph."
2309,2309,6,Mark,False,11," Well, actually, things have been a bit tough to be honest."
2310,2310,6,Mark,False,5,Jeremy's uncle passed away yesterday.
2311,2311,6,Mark,False,5," Yeah, bearing up, you know."
2312,2312,6,Mark,False,14,"But listen, Sophie, I wanted to ask you, might you be free on Friday?"
2313,2313,6,Mark,False,3,For the funeral?
2314,2314,6,Mark,True,1,Oh.
2315,2315,6,Mark,True,3,"Oh no, shit."
2316,2316,6,Mark,True,5,"It's not perfect, it's cracked."
2317,2317,6,Mark,True,2,Oh piss.
2318,2318,6,Mark,False,6,"I mean, you don't have to."
2319,2319,6,Mark,False,8,I just thought it might be nice if…
2320,2320,6,Mark,False,4," No, no, not friend."
2321,2321,6,Mark,False,1,No.
2322,2322,6,Mark,False,5,As a kind of date.
2323,2323,6,Mark,False,12,"I mean I thought afterwards, if you like, we could go somewhere."
2324,2324,6,Mark,False,4, Somewhere like the wake.
2325,2325,6,Mark,False,8," That's the beauty, no invites at a funeral."
2326,2326,6,Mark,False,7,"Jesus, where did they get this guy?"
2327,2327,6,Mark,False,7,This whole thing is a freak show.
2328,2328,6,Mark,False,5,Why am I even here?
2329,2329,6,Mark,False,4,Why is she here?
2330,2330,6,Mark,True,3,"Hey, yeah, OK."
2331,2331,6,Mark,True,3,The sympathy vote.
2332,2332,6,Mark,True,9,"Well done, Jez, old mate, you did him proud."
2333,2333,6,Mark,True,3,"Oh, poor Ray."
2334,2334,6,Mark,True,7,"He's in there, in that cardboard box."
2335,2335,6,Mark,True,3,I can't believe…
2336,2336,6,Mark,True,1,Shit!
2337,2337,6,Mark,True,6,This just gets better and better!
2338,2338,6,Mark,False,6," No, I'm OK, I'll be fine."
2339,2339,6,Mark,False,7,I've got to be strong for Jeremy.
2340,2340,6,Mark,False,1, Right.
2341,2341,6,Mark,False,8,"One minute we're alive, the next we're dead."
2342,2342,6,Mark,False,2," Right, yeah."
2343,2343,6,Mark,False,14,"I mean, if I want an X-Box, why don't I just get an X-Box?"
2344,2344,6,Mark,True,3,You're losing her.
2345,2345,6,Mark,False,4,It's a brief candle.
2346,2346,6,Mark,False,4,A bloody brief candle.
2347,2347,6,Mark,False,8," Sophie, c-can I say how beautiful you look?"
2348,2348,6,Mark,False,6,"Can- can I kiss you, Sophie?"
2349,2349,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, my God."
2350,2350,6,Mark,False,6,Umm what about my abnormal knackers?
2351,2351,6,Mark,False,4,"Ooh, this is nice."
2352,2352,6,Mark,False,4,How weird are they?
2353,2353,6,Mark,False,13,"What I really need is a good, long look at another man's bollocks."
2354,2354,6,Mark,False,7,But that's so fraught with potential problems.
2355,2355,6,Mark,False,1, Oh.
2356,2356,6,Mark,False,3,That was nice.
2357,2357,6,Mark,True,3,Thank you Ray!
2358,2358,6,Mark,True,3,Thank you Ray!
2359,2359,6,Mark,True,3,Thank you Ray!
2360,2360,6,Mark,False,2," Hey, Jez!"
2361,2361,6,Mark,False,3,I've got news!
2362,2362,6,Mark,False,14, Sophie's coming away with me to a cottage with a bed for the weekend!
2363,2363,6,Mark,False,14,"Now, listen mate, I need to ask you a straight-up, man-to-man question about bollocks."
2364,2364,6,Mark,False,1, What?
2365,2365,6,Mark,False,2,Y-you're kidding.
2366,2366,6,Mark,False,1, Tests?
2367,2367,6,Mark,False,2,"Jesus, mate."
2368,2368,6,Mark,False,1,Fuck.
2369,2369,6,Mark,False,4,"No, are you OK?"
2370,2370,6,Mark,False,4," Look, don't be scared."
2371,2371,6,Mark,False,3, Don't be scared.
2372,2372,6,Mark,False,4," That's fine, that's fine."
2373,2373,6,Mark,False,6,It's perfectly natural to be scared.
2374,2374,6,Mark,True,8,Doctor Runcimen has seen this a thousand times.
2375,2375,6,Mark,True,13,"It's just two guys, one with his hand on the other guy's balls."
2376,2376,6,Mark,False,1, Oh.
2377,2377,6,Mark,False,4,Pleased to meet you.
2378,2378,6,Mark,True,1,No.
2379,2379,6,Mark,True,5,"No, no, no, no, no."
2380,2380,6,Mark,False,12," Oh, it was just- I think I should probably see the doctor."
2381,2381,6,Mark,False,10,"You know, not that I've got anything against... your kind."
2382,2382,6,Mark,False,16," Basically, it's, uh, not wishing to beat about the bush, it's a problem with... with my..."
2383,2383,6,Mark,False,1, Test-ist-icles.
2384,2384,6,Mark,False,6,"So if you'd feel happier, I…"
2385,2385,6,Mark,True,11,"Oh, I hope I don't- no leaping to attention, Captain Corrigan."
2386,2386,6,Mark,True,9,I mean anyone would say she's an attractive woman.
2387,2387,6,Mark,True,12,She should have to wear a mask for this kind of thing.
2388,2388,6,Mark,True,11,"Reagan or Batman or... actually, she'd look pretty horny as Batman."
2389,2389,6,Mark,True,3,"Jesus, no, don't!"
2390,2390,6,Mark,False,6,So have you... worked here long?
2391,2391,6,Mark,False,1, Blimey?
2392,2392,6,Mark,False,2,What's blimey?
2393,2393,6,Mark,False,6," No, no, no, that feels great."
2394,2394,6,Mark,False,6,"I mean, not great, just normal."
2395,2395,6,Mark,True,7,"Ooh, how much can a man take?"
2396,2396,6,Mark,True,13,"Yep, that's cooled things off, that's a regular bucket of water right there."
2397,2397,6,Mark,False,3," OK, Jez, mate."
2398,2398,6,Mark,False,5,I think that's about it.
2399,2399,6,Mark,False,3, I don't know.
2400,2400,6,Mark,False,7,He gets the test results on Monday.
2401,2401,6,Mark,False,4,What do you think?
2402,2402,6,Mark,False,7," The thing is, he's not definitely dying."
2403,2403,6,Mark,False,5,He's not even definitely ill.
2404,2404,6,Mark,False,5, I think that's just Biro.
2405,2405,6,Mark,False,8,"Anyway, he seems to be over that now."
2406,2406,6,Mark,False,3,And the whinnying.
2407,2407,6,Mark,False,4,Things are looking positive.
2408,2408,6,Mark,False,7,He's investigating the key to all spiritualities.
2409,2409,6,Mark,False,2, Uh Jez.
2410,2410,6,Mark,False,32,"Me and Soph, we were just having a chat, and, well, what we were saying is that actually what we both really want is for you to come along on our weekend."
2411,2411,6,Mark,False,11," Oh, come on, you can take your religious texts with you."
2412,2412,6,Mark,True,7,Maybe he really doesn't want to come!
2413,2413,6,Mark,False,6, It'll just be such a laugh.
2414,2414,6,Mark,True,6,"Please say no, please say no."
2415,2415,6,Mark,True,13,If I can just get the first one over without a major embarrassment.
2416,2416,6,Mark,True,5,First fuck is damage limitation.
2417,2417,6,Mark,True,17,"In, out, as much pleasure as I can give her, apologise, and then we can move on."
2418,2418,6,Mark,True,4,"Jesus, look at him."
2419,2419,6,Mark,True,3,What a disaster.
2420,2420,6,Mark,False,4, Do you have to?
2421,2421,6,Mark,False,6,We're trying to play a game.
2422,2422,6,Mark,False,13," Well, if you don't want your go, I'll take mine, I'm attacking Irkutsk."
2423,2423,6,Mark,False,8, Yeah well you will when I take Asia.
2424,2424,6,Mark,False,2," Well, fine."
2425,2425,6,Mark,False,5,I'm off for a shower.
2426,2426,6,Mark,False,3,"Good night, Jeremy."
2427,2427,6,Mark,False,7,"See you in the bed... room, Soph."
2428,2428,6,Mark,False,1, Sophie?
2429,2429,6,Mark,False,6,Jez must've gone for a walk.
2430,2430,6,Mark,False,4,Thank God for that.
2431,2431,6,Mark,False,6,You think he'd be more grateful.
2432,2432,6,Mark,False,14,He'll change his tune when I'm the one in charge of the morphine supply.
2433,2433,6,Mark,False,8," Jez, I didn't— I mean, I didn't mean…"
2434,2434,6,Mark,True,2,"Oh, wow."
2435,2435,6,Mark,True,2,"Oh, yeah."
2436,2436,6,Mark,True,2,"Oh, yeah."
2437,2437,6,Mark,True,8,"Oh, yeah, she is so- where am I?"
2438,2438,6,Mark,True,6,Put your tongue out and see.
2439,2439,6,Mark,True,1,Neck?
2440,2440,6,Mark,True,2,"Yeah, neck."
2441,2441,6,Mark,True,1,Oh.
2442,2442,6,Mark,True,2,"Whoo-hoo-ho-ho, ha-ha!"
2443,2443,6,Mark,True,7,"You can do that again, oh, yeah!"
2444,2444,6,Mark,False,1, Yeah?
2445,2445,6,Mark,False,2," Uh, yeah."
2446,2446,6,Mark,False,3,"Yeah, I will."
2447,2447,6,Mark,False,12,"But, Sophie, before I do, I need to prepare you for something."
2448,2448,6,Mark,False,22,"I intend to have an operation, but until I do, I don't want you to be alarmed by the size of my…"
2449,2449,6,Mark,False,5," Shit, they're in the bathroom."
2450,2450,6,Mark,False,6,"Stay right there, don't go away."
2451,2451,6,Mark,True,4,Got to be quick.
2452,2452,6,Mark,True,11,Don't want to have to get her all worked up again.
2453,2453,6,Mark,True,6,"Jesus, did she say ""johnnies"", plural?"
2454,2454,6,Mark,True,9,Hope she doesn't think I'm some sort of superman.
2455,2455,6,Mark,True,8,Couldn't even be bothered to go to bed.
2456,2456,6,Mark,True,3,"It's pathetic, really."
2457,2457,6,Mark,True,1,What's-?
2458,2458,6,Mark,True,5,Oh my God he's— no!
2459,2459,6,Mark,True,4,"Don't be dead, mate."
2460,2460,6,Mark,True,2,"Shit, no."
2461,2461,6,Mark,True,3,"Oh, God, no."
2462,2462,6,Mark,True,4,In front of Tenko!
2463,2463,6,Mark,True,6,That was probably the last straw.
2464,2464,6,Mark,True,2,"Oh, fuck!"
2465,2465,6,Mark,True,6,"Oh, fuck, don't be dead, mate!"
2466,2466,6,Mark,True,4,Please don't be dead!
2467,2467,6,Mark,True,5,My cock's gone right down!
2468,2468,6,Mark,True,1,Fuck.
2469,2469,6,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
2470,2470,6,Mark,False,5,"Soph, something awful has happened!"
2471,2471,6,Mark,False,4, He's opened his eyes!
2472,2472,6,Mark,False,5,"Jez, we're right here Jez!"
2473,2473,6,Mark,False,11," You're in safe hands now, Jez, you're gonna be all right."
2474,2474,6,Mark,False,1, No.
2475,2475,6,Mark,False,4,No more than usual.
2476,2476,6,Mark,False,2, A pass?
2477,2477,6,Mark,False,11,He- the bloody- he's been under a lot of stress recently.
2478,2478,6,Mark,False,7," He's delirious, the whole bottle was empty."
2479,2479,6,Mark,False,17, I invite you here and you repay me by trying to... have it away with my girlfriend!
2480,2480,6,Mark,False,3," Oh, were you?"
2481,2481,6,Mark,False,2,Were you?
2482,2482,6,Mark,False,1, What?
2483,2483,6,Mark,False,2,But you—
2484,2484,6,Mark,False,11," Soph, don't worry, it's only me, I've got something for you."
2485,2485,6,Mark,False,7," But I checked, no one was coming."
2486,2486,6,Mark,False,2, It's not?
2487,2487,6,Mark,False,2, A talk?
2488,2488,6,Mark,False,1,Oh.
2489,2489,6,Mark,False,5, Are you finishing with me?
2490,2490,6,Mark,False,1, Oh.
2491,2491,6,Mark,False,1,Right.
2492,2492,6,Mark,False,8," OK, well, that's just, I guess, you know…"
2493,2493,6,Mark,False,5," Uh, no, it's... it's your pants."
2494,2494,6,Mark,False,13," I found them in my suitcase and I thought... anyway, here you go."
2495,2495,6,Mark,False,3, Not a problem.
2496,2496,6,Mark,False,2," OK, great."
2497,2497,6,Mark,False,2,See you.
