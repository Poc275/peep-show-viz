0,0,1,Jeremy,False,17,"You know, these are nice. Nice shot of you two, nice font. Just a great all-round package."
1,1,1,Jeremy,False,20,"What for? In case you marry someone else called Sophie, who looks exactly like Sophie, and you don't jilt her?"
2,2,1,Jeremy,False,30,"Paula... Yello. How's my hot date for tonight? Hmm? Heather? Yeah, I think I remember. Double date? Yeah, why not? Yeah, I think I've got just the guy. Hang on."
3,3,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Mark, double date, tonight?"
4,4,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Mark, beggars can't be choosers. She's an actual woman."
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,26,"OK, I've got someone. Tell her not to get her hopes up, but he's a safe pair of hands. Yeah, see you there. Bye-bye, bye, bye."
6,6,1,Jeremy,False,5,You're back in the game!
7,7,1,Jeremy,False,10,"She's a friend of Paula's. You remember Paula, Toni's sister?"
8,8,1,Jeremy,False,11,"No, Paula's cool. She's cultural. We're gonna see a play tonight."
9,9,1,Jeremy,False,56,"Yeah I know, but relax, it's all different now, they've moved on. They use proper actors. You know, Americans and people off the telly. And they're all based on films, so it's fine. We might need to tidy up a bit. And we might have to un-tape the DVD and video and TV and Sky remotes."
10,10,1,Jeremy,False,17,"It smells wrong. I mean, the Megatron doesn't say ""urban free-wheelers"". It says ""sofa masturbators"", you know?"
11,11,1,Jeremy,False,7,Here we are. What are you doing?
12,12,1,Jeremy,False,6,There they are. Heather's the blonde.
13,13,1,Jeremy,False,9,Will you keep it together? Just play it cool.
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Heather, this is Mark."
15,15,1,Jeremy,False,5,"So, great to see you."
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,2,Oh. OK.
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,3,It wasn't me.
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,20,"It's symptom-less? Oh, right. So, what's the biggie? I mean, no one minds if the Invisible Man comes to dinner."
19,19,1,Jeremy,True,15,Maybe I can get into this. Sexually transmitted disease. Sexually-transmitted. Sexually. Sexy. I'm feeling sexy.
20,20,1,Jeremy,True,3,Not so sexy.
21,21,1,Jeremy,False,7,When do we get to go out?
22,22,1,Jeremy,False,6,You're kidding. I think I'll die.
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, God! Why aren't we watching television?"
24,24,1,Jeremy,False,24,"I've got Heat on DVD at home. We're watching this, when for less money we could be watching Robert De Niro and Al Pacino."
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,7,OK. Let's pretend we're just watching Heat
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Look, let's just go."
27,27,1,Jeremy,False,8,Screw the date! No date is worth this.
28,28,1,Jeremy,False,3,I'm going. Come!
29,29,1,Jeremy,True,27,This is amazing. I wasn't meant to be out till eleven and it's not even nine! I've time-travelled. I've made time! I could do anything. I'm golden!
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,12,Here you go mate. Go and see the second half. It's shit.
31,31,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Mark, look. Look what's bloody happened."
32,32,1,Jeremy,False,6,Exactly. That's exactly what I thought.
33,33,1,Jeremy,False,30,"Well, no, I thought I'd check with you first 'cause, you know, I didn't know if... I mean, what do you call? Or do you do it all online now?"
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,11,I don't know. Maybe I'm in shock. I've lost some CDs.
35,35,1,Jeremy,False,33,"And they nicked my little bit of dope. Actually maybe I smoked that, but they might have done. They certainly nicked the PlayStation. Shall we get some pizza? We're too stressed to cook."
36,36,1,Jeremy,False,13,"I know, everything's shit. You've lost your iPod, I've got chlamydia. American Hot?"
37,37,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, Paula told me. Still, it's only chlamydia. Symptom-less."
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,3,"What? Oh, yeah."
39,39,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, yeah, yeah. At some point."
40,40,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, all right, Dr. Miriam Stoppard. Fine, I'll do it! Jesus!"
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, God! That is so- why do burglars do that?"
42,42,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, that was me actually. Sorry. You know, I don't always remember to... I get distracted."
43,43,1,Jeremy,False,33,"Yeah. So I've been getting in touch with all my exes because there's something I need to tell them. But I just thought, why not turn it into a bit of a date?"
44,44,1,Jeremy,False,2,Is he?
45,45,1,Jeremy,False,24,My news? What is my news? My news... is that... I've just got this hunch that everything's going to turn out OK in Iraq.
46,46,1,Jeremy,False,33,"Yeah well obviously everyone seems to have this massive downer on the whole thing but I say, ""It ain't over till it's over, baby."" So what shall we have to drink, to celebrate?"
47,47,1,Jeremy,True,42,"Shit. Can't ask how much. Restaurant. You have to pretend you're infinitely wealthy, for some reason. OK, flicking, looking. If only I knew the name of any other wine. What's a wine? Is the one Hannibal Lecter drinks real or a joke?"
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,6,A bottle of Barolo it is.
49,49,1,Jeremy,True,15,"There it is! Oh, shit, no! forty-five quid! I've just spent forty-five quid on wine."
50,50,1,Jeremy,False,4,"I'm paying, I assume."
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,2,Of course.
52,52,1,Jeremy,True,6,There's a fiver's worth right there.
53,53,1,Jeremy,False,35,"Oh, that is fantastic! This, this is wine. Yeah, look at what these idiots are drinking. Look at these dicks! Ha! Obviously it's not really delicious, like hot chocolate or Coke, but for wine... brilliant!"
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Mark, what are you doing? Who are you sitting on?"
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,7,He might have got the wrong flat.
56,56,1,Jeremy,False,12,Well at least stop sitting on him. You look like a dick.
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,24,Oh guard duty. Great vibe. Just put him in the kitchen with a couple of Garfields. What do you think he's going to do?
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,7,"So... what's going on for you, man?"
59,59,1,Jeremy,False,13,Did you run away from home? Are you a rent boy and everything?
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,20,"And how would you take him down, just out of interest? With extreme prejudice? Or On Her Majesty's Secret Service?"
61,61,1,Jeremy,False,13,Good. We're trying to relax. He's your guest. Put him in your room.
62,62,1,Jeremy,False,15,"Mark, everyone in London is not trying to do a shit on your possessions. Relax."
63,63,1,Jeremy,False,6,Leave off man. She's only brainstorming.
64,64,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Er, no, not really."
65,65,1,Jeremy,False,21,"Mark, if I have to fuck you to fuck her, then I will. So you be careful where you stand, OK?"
66,66,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, fucking hell! Let's just get him out of here."
67,67,1,Jeremy,False,27,"Look, any minute our door is gonna get kicked down by a hundred maniacs with no stake in society. Is that your idea of a relaxing date?"
68,68,1,Jeremy,False,15,Fine. You're a knob. Good luck with your civilisation. I'm barricading myself in my room.
69,69,1,Jeremy,False,1,Suze.
70,70,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Mark, the barbarians are at the gate! It's your responsibility!"
71,71,1,Jeremy,False,15,"They're going to get in and have us all, Mark. Just let him go, OK?"
72,72,1,Jeremy,True,26,"That little dick! If they come in here and kill me before I get to have sex, I'm going to be so annoyed. Oh, fuck it!"
73,73,1,Jeremy,False,33,"Come on. Right, I'm going to let you go 'cause I'm a really nice guy like that, but you've got to promise that you won't burgle us again because we've got a bond."
74,74,1,Jeremy,True,5,I think he likes me.
75,75,1,Jeremy,False,23,"OK, I'm going to let you go now, but if you ever come back, then me and my mate will go mental. OK?"
76,76,1,Jeremy,True,15,"OK, this is good. He'll probably write a rap about how amazing I am... Shit!"
77,77,1,Jeremy,True,5,Don't hurt my lovely face!
78,78,1,Jeremy,False,3,Fuck! Shhh! Careful!
79,79,1,Jeremy,False,8,He escaped. He overpowered me. They got in.
80,80,1,Jeremy,False,1,No.
81,81,1,Jeremy,False,26,"Well maybe you should chase them down, Mark? Maybe if your date saw you beating up a whole gang of children, that would get her hot."
82,82,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Mark, shut up!"
83,83,1,Jeremy,False,24,Of course it's not AIDS. This isn't the 80s. It's the best STD. Just cute old mostly symptom-less chlamydia. And I haven't even definitely...
84,84,1,Jeremy,False,31,"I don't know. Probably I was going to tell you, sensitively, during the next little bit of time. Until he just blurted it all out. Look, Suze, no...! Suze! Don't go!"
85,85,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Mark, I need to go."
86,86,1,Jeremy,False,1,Bollocks.
87,87,1,Jeremy,False,38,"Ooh! I can't wait to see this. What are you going to do? Oh, my God! What are you doing? Are you putting your hand on me? Are you having a fight with me? Are you fighting me?"
88,88,1,Jeremy,False,5,"I'm going to go, Mark."
89,89,1,Jeremy,False,29,"My God, you are! You are fighting me! This is incredible! You're putting your foot behind me and you're pushing me down towards the floor! Finally, you're restraining me!"
90,90,1,Jeremy,False,17,This is- why hasn't this happened before? This is what it's all been leading towards isn't it!
91,91,1,Jeremy,False,17,Oh yeah have a good old rootle around in there. You never know what you might find.
92,92,1,Jeremy,False,5,He is a weird guy.
93,93,1,Jeremy,False,5,She might be the one?
94,94,1,Jeremy,True,3,I'm his one.
95,95,2,Jeremy,False,8,You have been feeling this for a while.
96,96,2,Jeremy,False,1,Mm-hmm.
97,97,2,Jeremy,False,4,But it probably helps.
98,98,2,Jeremy,False,9,You told me Kinky Layton was all over you.
99,99,2,Jeremy,True,13,"Who's this? And Sophie's dad, angry tweedy father. This is a chain-on scenario."
100,100,2,Jeremy,False,1,Hello?
101,101,2,Jeremy,False,2,Not really.
102,102,2,Jeremy,False,3,Oh right. Hi.
103,103,2,Jeremy,False,5,Is this gonna take long?
104,104,2,Jeremy,False,8,"OK, well thanks. Good to see you... Barney."
105,105,2,Jeremy,False,6,Another roast? That's the third today.
106,106,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah but, chain-eating roasts?"
107,107,2,Jeremy,False,6,Sophie's dad. And her cousin Barney.
108,108,2,Jeremy,False,6,"It's the wedding tuna, your half."
109,109,2,Jeremy,False,12,"They were dropping Sophie off. She's going back to work tomorrow, so..."
110,110,2,Jeremy,False,2,What lies?
111,111,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Right, technically- I mean I'm on your side, but technically that's not a lie."
112,112,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Well maybe, but I think what sticks in everyone's memory is the bit where you jilted her."
113,113,2,Jeremy,False,4,What do you think?
114,114,2,Jeremy,False,6,"It's a simple shit-muncher, Sohpie's cousin."
115,115,2,Jeremy,False,18,"I think that what's happening is two, or maybe three, different musical things all at the same time."
116,116,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Only thing is, doing complicated shit like this, wouldn't that be against the big beat manifesto?"
117,117,2,Jeremy,False,5,Did we write it down?
118,118,2,Jeremy,False,12,Right. At the time it felt like a much more all-encompassing philosophy.
119,119,2,Jeremy,False,29,"Well, listening to this, it did make me think, lately I've been having some ideas and this is exactly the sort of thing that I was thinking of doing."
120,120,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Well, has he? That's what I'm wondering. Nicked my idea and then done it back to me."
121,121,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Until he arrives, should we send this out to promoters?"
122,122,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh yeah, cause sometimes it's really hard, actually, to do your own ideas."
123,123,2,Jeremy,True,8,Think I found someone to do my hoovering.
124,124,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah, that is a bit like me."
125,125,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, it's standard procedure for a new band member."
126,126,2,Jeremy,False,2,"No, no."
127,127,2,Jeremy,False,13,"It's cool, Barney's just staying over for a bit. He's joined the band."
128,128,2,Jeremy,False,11,While you're down there how about some Ribena and a Twirl?
129,129,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh relax Mark, it's fine."
130,130,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Look Mark, we heard today we've got a spot at The Fuck Bunker."
131,131,2,Jeremy,False,21,"Yes, and we've got an A&R man coming so we need to have a contract, everything nice and tied down, yeah?"
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,5,"No, of course he isn't."
133,133,2,Jeremy,True,5,"Still, blowjob and a Twirl."
134,134,2,Jeremy,False,1,Anything?
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Oh, dude, what? Come on, we need more tracks for the gig. Good ones."
136,136,2,Jeremy,False,13,How long can it take to come up with three minutes of music?
137,137,2,Jeremy,False,8,That's being generous. That's two minutes per minute.
138,138,2,Jeremy,False,18,"All right, we'll let you have a poppadom. You can have one poppadom and a bit of chutney."
139,139,2,Jeremy,True,8,I'm so generous. I'm like a techno Gandhi.
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,17,What if we said you couldn't be in the band unless you sucked one of us off?
141,141,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Go on, if you had to."
142,142,2,Jeremy,False,9,You'd suck Super Hans off. That is so funny.
143,143,2,Jeremy,True,14,"Screw them, I'll just keep trying to suck myself off. I'll get there eventually."
144,144,2,Jeremy,True,88,"I wonder if the A&R guy's here yet. Which one could he be? Could be him, perfect cover. Or her. Or her. Lot of women here. Hmm, women. There they are, walking around. And they've all got them, under their clothes, hiding there, but I know the secret. Vaginas. She's got one, she's got one, she's got one. She's definitely got one. She's trying to make out she hasn't got one but I know she has. Got to stop thinking about vaginas, it's my big night. Mmm, vaginas."
145,145,2,Jeremy,False,3,What's going on?
146,146,2,Jeremy,False,6,What have you done to him?
147,147,2,Jeremy,False,6,Has he been sucking you off?
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,47,What the fuck are we gonna do? We don't know how to play his mu- our music. We're the front men. I was planning on just waving a maraca and giving the hotties my sex eyes. Why the hell did you get him to suck you off?
149,149,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Shit, we're on! What're we gonna do? Barney? Barney come on out mate, please?"
150,150,2,Jeremy,False,30,"All right, all right. But just don't, don't suck him off, all right? And don't make him suck you off. Just get him out there without any more sucking off!"
151,151,2,Jeremy,False,23,"Hey everyone, so, great. We're almost ready but um, before we rock you, um, we need to find out, um, are you ready?"
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah, OK. But are you really, are you really, really, really ready?"
153,153,2,Jeremy,False,23,"Great, you're really, you're ready. So, yeah, yeah. So you're ready to party, OK. We know that now. But my next question is..."
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,10,"...are you ready to party hard, right here, right now?"
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,1,Mega.
156,156,2,Jeremy,False,3,What's going on?
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Yeah, well we've missed our slot. Dance Witch Abortion are on now and they're rocking out."
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,16,You've ruined this. Why couldn't you have got him to suck you off after the gig?
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,27,He's not all he's cracked up to be. Who's the really cool one? You should look a bit deeper before you go sucking someone off next time.
160,160,2,Jeremy,False,1,Prick.
161,161,3,Jeremy,False,8,That smells good. Is that a Cumberland sausage?
162,162,3,Jeremy,False,6,That's an onion gravy isn't it?
163,163,3,Jeremy,False,31,"Speed dating? And a party? Mark, you know that if you end up a basket case I'm the one who's going to have to wheel you round the National Army Museum."
164,164,3,Jeremy,False,9,Do you think you're going to eat all that?
165,165,3,Jeremy,False,2,I'm hungry.
166,166,3,Jeremy,True,45,"I'm the skinny one. I need food more than him. Yeah might just Robin Hood this baby. He's such a tight arse, won't even replace the wide screen. How are they supposed to brainwash me with their adverts if I can't even see them properly?"
167,167,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Read the mitigating circumstances, there are loads."
168,168,3,Jeremy,False,4,What are you doing?
169,169,3,Jeremy,False,4,Oh for God's sake.
170,170,3,Jeremy,False,3,Limits? What limits?
171,171,3,Jeremy,False,43,"Look Mark, lay off will you? The thing is, and I keep meaning to tell you this, but basically, a few years ago mummy gave me a nest egg. And I kept on meaning to... invest, but it turns out I've spent it."
172,172,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Yeah, fine, whatever, but it's difficult, you know? There just aren't that many media positions out there. That's the reality."
173,173,3,Jeremy,False,19,I can't believe you're trying to make me get a job not in the media. You're such a bastard.
174,174,3,Jeremy,True,9,"Mmm, delicious Cumberland final straw, dripping in onion gravy."
175,175,3,Jeremy,True,11,Yeah I'll get on my bike. My bike's my big dick!
176,176,3,Jeremy,True,11,"Wow, she's hot. Maybes she's a sort of warm up act."
177,177,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Great, thanks. Listen I just wanted to say, I'm sorry."
178,178,3,Jeremy,False,38,"For what goes on through there. I just want to assure you that, I'm not the same as the rest of these feckless cum-shedders. So if you ever need anyone for a private donation, you've got my details."
179,179,3,Jeremy,True,17,"Ooo, bit creepy. Spermy atmosphere is cramping my style. Right, time to open my sticky bank account."
180,180,3,Jeremy,True,91,"Hey where's the porn? No porn? Am I supposed to just dry hump myself? There must be something I can use. Would it be wrong? Why not? It's a free country. OK Queeny, it's back in the 50s, you're nice and young, you've just been coronated. I'm taking off your cloak. No, leave the crown on. Oooh, what's this? Stockings? You've been getting through your nylon ration book pretty quickly, you naughty, sexy Queen. Oh shit. Right here we- Oh, Elgar! Oh I've totally lost it now. Thanks a bunch Elgar!"
181,181,3,Jeremy,True,7,What's my stuff doing in the hall?
182,182,3,Jeremy,False,31,"You're redecorating? Aww you felt bad about before, that's nice. Not sure about that for the ceiling colour, but then, it's not me that looks at that, it's the chicks, right?"
183,183,3,Jeremy,False,7,I'm sorry? Saz? Saz who? What Saz?
184,184,3,Jeremy,False,7,What the fuck? You're kicking me out?
185,185,3,Jeremy,False,8,What? And what do you call this exactly?
186,186,3,Jeremy,False,5,Benecol margarine? Soya milk? Marrow?
187,187,3,Jeremy,False,19,"I know why you're buying it. Because you know I don't like it, but you don't like it either."
188,188,3,Jeremy,False,4,What's she paying then?
189,189,3,Jeremy,False,46,"Right, so that's what it comes down to is it? You don't wanna bone me, so I'm out. It's that brutal. ""Have you seen the old man down by the seaman's mission?"" ""Yes, not very fuckable is he, screw him!"" That's what it is isn't it?"
190,190,3,Jeremy,False,5,I suppose anything could happen.
191,191,3,Jeremy,False,4,They might shag us.
192,192,3,Jeremy,False,5,They might shag each other.
193,193,3,Jeremy,False,4,I'll open the tequila.
194,194,3,Jeremy,False,20,Terrible. I was in the hall for most of the night. What's so funny? That's what I want to know.
195,195,3,Jeremy,False,10,"I don't think they're ever gonna screw us, do you?"
196,196,3,Jeremy,False,6,When are they going to leave?
197,197,3,Jeremy,False,22,"I'll get some money, really I will. I just need to sleep Mark. If they don't go, I might have to go."
198,198,3,Jeremy,False,5,"So, when's she moving out?"
199,199,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Have you given her a time limit? 'Cause when you chucked me out, no time limit, and here I still am."
200,200,3,Jeremy,False,5,In the last two minutes?
201,201,3,Jeremy,False,20,She is so doing a number on you. This is the fucking limit! I need to get some sleep Mark.
202,202,3,Jeremy,False,11,"I don't know, Super Hans or Pej's houseboat or Big Suze's."
203,203,3,Jeremy,True,12,"OK, I'm homeless and she's got a home. It's a perfect fit."
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,22,"Oh you know, Mark kicked me out so I don't have anywhere to live right now, but I'm actually really enjoying myself."
205,205,3,Jeremy,False,22,"So listen, I was wondering, depending on what you're doing and stuff, whether or not, I might come and live with you?"
206,206,3,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh yeah we can get rid of Johnson, I mean the guy's a dick so..."
207,207,3,Jeremy,False,12,I could take very good care of you. I'm not a hobo.
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
209,209,3,Jeremy,True,43,"God look at all this stuff. Lovely stuff you could steal then sell, then eat and... is that Johnson's credit card? With the PIN? If someone does that, you're supposed to rob them aren't you? Just one sandwich, I'll post it right back."
210,210,3,Jeremy,True,56,"Thank you Johnson, got my rotisserie chicken, got my kilo of extra mature cheddar, bottle of Cristal, gonna slip on my headphones, slap a DVD on the portable and have me a homeless hip-hop cheesy luncheon banquet. It's a victimless crime. Johnson will report it stolen, who loses? Wallace and Gromit? Gromit doesn't care, Gromit's fine."
211,211,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Hi just, buying some stuff, if that's OK."
212,212,3,Jeremy,True,35,"Here we go again, this is so easy. What's going on? Come on, come on, come on, come on, why won't it go? Nothing's happening. Shit, I'm gonna get caught. I'm gonna be tasered alive."
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh! Course, wrong way round, yeah. My card, my silly card, bad card, always wrong aren't you card."
214,214,3,Jeremy,True,5,"Calm down, not too much."
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,13,"And can I get thirty, er, fifty pounds cash back as well please?"
216,216,3,Jeremy,True,19,"Eight-zero-zero-eight, that is a nice pin. Oh Elgar! Why do you always find me at my lowest points, Elgar?"
217,217,3,Jeremy,False,2,Hey Mark.
218,218,3,Jeremy,False,3,Happy birthday man.
219,219,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Well you know you're always saying about taking up the violin, so I thought, now's your chance."
220,220,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Johnson. What the fuck, you're in Frankfurt."
221,221,3,Jeremy,False,6,Well something's come through for me.
222,222,3,Jeremy,True,2,Oh shit!
223,223,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Yes naturally, that's why I was coming to see you, to let you in on our scam."
224,224,3,Jeremy,False,28,"Yes. I load up on goodies, you put a call in saying your card's lost, shazam! You get your cash back, plus a little extra. Everyone's a winner."
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,12,"OK, fine, everyone wins, I get my suit, you get your violin."
226,226,3,Jeremy,False,8,Well learn the violin as well. Chill out.
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,9,"If you wanna dance with her, dance with her."
228,228,3,Jeremy,False,7,Maybe we should... if you fancy it?
229,229,4,Jeremy,False,25,"She is dead, she is dead! Dead old Gwen is dead, dead, dead! Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! Dead old Gwen is dead!"
230,230,4,Jeremy,False,36,"Come on, she was my mum's aunt. I only met her about twice. It's not like she was Ian Curtis. She was never gonna make a seminal album. She couldn't even make very good Christmas cake."
231,231,4,Jeremy,False,32,Mum's getting forty grand in the will and she's promised me half. It's all gravy from here Mark. Good old Gwen. I couldn't have planned this better if I'd murdered her myself.
232,232,4,Jeremy,False,13,"What do you mean? Twenty thousand pounds, I'm gonna to be a millionaire!"
233,233,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Wednesday. But mum's coming over this afternoon, which will be incredibly boring."
234,234,4,Jeremy,False,1,Shit!
235,235,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah, I reckon it's a war gun. This is great, this isn't bin or sell, this is a keeper."
236,236,4,Jeremy,False,9,"It's not illegal, probably. It's just a grisly souvenir."
237,237,4,Jeremy,False,16,"I'll keep it in my room, it'll be safe there. I'll put it in a drawer."
238,238,4,Jeremy,True,10,"Yeah, sure, you've got sarcasm. I've got a big gun!"
239,239,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Mummy, coffee. Fucky hurry-uppy."
240,240,4,Jeremy,False,9,Did you bring those CDs like I told you?
241,241,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Might be an idea. Oh, and guess what? You forgot to top-up my mobile, again."
242,242,4,Jeremy,False,31,"Oh right, stick up for mummy. You don't know her Mark, you don't know her tricks. Anyway, what's it to you? Do you want to fuck my mum, is that it?"
243,243,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Mum, Mark wants to fuck you!"
244,244,4,Jeremy,False,7,"He definitely wants to fuck you, Mum."
245,245,4,Jeremy,False,9,Me? I'm not the one dressed like a prossie.
246,246,4,Jeremy,False,26,"And I suppose your relationship with your mum is healthy, is it? Sitting in silence, watching Taggart. Thirty years of mutual resentment eating away at you."
247,247,4,Jeremy,False,7,Where are those clothes I asked for?
248,248,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Who's Martin? Oh God, not another boyfriend. Fucking hell, Mum. How many's that now?"
249,249,4,Jeremy,True,8,How come she gets all the bloody boyfriends?
250,250,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Hi, are you my new daddy?"
251,251,4,Jeremy,False,6,Did you kill many black babies?
252,252,4,Jeremy,False,18,Are you buying somewhere? I hope this isn't coming out of my chunk of the dead Gwen bonanza.
253,253,4,Jeremy,False,3,Spoke about what?
254,254,4,Jeremy,False,2,Fuck off!
255,255,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Mum? You said that I could have half of Gwen's money. That's what you said, to me, your son."
256,256,4,Jeremy,False,2,Hello Mark.
257,257,4,Jeremy,False,22,"You like it Mark. That's fine, you like the gun. Guns are great. Design classics like the Routemaster bus or... those chairs."
258,258,4,Jeremy,False,3,"Sure, man. Enjoy."
259,259,4,Jeremy,False,8,"About the money, was it about my money?"
260,260,4,Jeremy,False,8,Why? Maybe they both want to fuck you.
261,261,4,Jeremy,False,6,Give us a go with Gunny.
262,262,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Well come on, my turn with Gunny. Now pass me the Doritos or I'll blow my brains out!"
263,263,4,Jeremy,False,23,"No, no, you gotta bat for me, talk me up, for you as much as me. I owe you over a thousand pounds."
264,264,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Exactly, over a thousand pounds."
265,265,4,Jeremy,False,23,"Well, did you do it? Have I got my money? Don't do the pause Mark, you're not Davina! Have I got my money?"
266,266,4,Jeremy,False,16,Yes! You beautiful man. I'm gonna tattoo your name on my balls. I'm a millionaire again.
267,267,4,Jeremy,False,27,"Oh, there's always conditions Mark. You can ignore conditions. When you sign up for a credit card or adopt a child, there are conditions - they're meaningless."
268,268,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh fuck, it's not Martin, is it?"
269,269,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Right, who is it? Is it some kind of Brewster's Millions scenario?"
270,270,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Brilliant, you're the boss of me. This is your pathetic dream come true, isn't it?"
271,271,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Great, so basically you're my dad now and you give me my pocket money?"
272,272,4,Jeremy,True,23,That would teach him if I did turn it down. That would wipe the shit-eating grin off his face if I did that.
273,273,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Of course I agree, obviously I agree."
274,274,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Can I have some money for expenses, on credit?"
275,275,4,Jeremy,True,20,"I'll shoot the breeze with Super Hans. Chatting shit with your mates is still free. You can't tax that, Brown!"
276,276,4,Jeremy,False,3,You all right?
277,277,4,Jeremy,False,1,No.
278,278,4,Jeremy,False,3,Are you tripping?
279,279,4,Jeremy,False,1,Glue?
280,280,4,Jeremy,True,11,I've never done glue. Never boffed a tranny. I've hardly lived.
281,281,4,Jeremy,False,27,"Come on then, what's the big news? Is it something disgusting? Are you trying for a baby? Or is he going to the Hague for war crimes?"
282,282,4,Jeremy,False,13,Oh what? So I only get ten grand now? That's a bit rich.
283,283,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Come on, Mum, can't I have it all? You'll be all right."
284,284,4,Jeremy,False,14,What?! So I get nothing? You can't just take it away. This is stealing.
285,285,4,Jeremy,False,37,"OK, do you want me to beg? That's fine. I'm fine with that, I beg you for money. OK? I beg you Mum, as your only child, to please make me happy by giving me my money."
286,286,4,Jeremy,True,28,"This is fine, I'm just back to being poor again. It's just money, I mean no-one died. No, no, Gwen died and I haven't got her fucking money!"
287,287,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Everything's shit flavoured, Mark. It's all ashes. What am I gonna do for money now?"
288,288,4,Jeremy,False,32,"Yes, but as I've told you before, Mark, re. doing a job, because of my creativity, it's kind of abuse. I'm thinking of selling Gunny. I could sell it to some Yardies."
289,289,4,Jeremy,False,14,Or I could shoot Martin. Or I could hire some Yardies to shoot Martin.
290,290,4,Jeremy,True,15,The Yardies will help me. I just need to get a number for the Yardies.
291,291,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Hello, Natalie. How's your dad?"
292,292,4,Jeremy,False,21,"Enjoying my money, is he? Is he lying in bath of my money? Nude, after having sex with my mum? Nude."
293,293,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Actually Mark, I think you'll find it is."
294,294,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Well all right, I'll stop being Hamlet when you stop being..."
295,295,4,Jeremy,False,3,A massive twat!
296,296,4,Jeremy,False,1,Yes.
297,297,4,Jeremy,False,12,Mainly Nurofen. How was the rest of your evening with Peaches Stalin?
298,298,4,Jeremy,False,11,"You asked her to stop, but she just carried on anyway?"
299,299,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Mark, it sounds like you've been raped by a soldier. Like in a Mike Leigh film."
300,300,4,Jeremy,False,22,"You said no. You said ""stop having sex with me please"" but she didn't listen. You my friend, are a rape victim."
301,301,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Do you have feelings of guilt and shame, self-loathing?"
302,302,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, sure."
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,7,I'm renting it out to Super Hans.
304,304,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Don't mind Mark, Super Hans. He's a bit down in the dumps. He's been raped."
305,305,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, it's not bum rape, no."
306,306,4,Jeremy,False,9,Do you think you're gonna write this book then?
307,307,4,Jeremy,False,9,I've got a title for you by the way.
308,308,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, ""The Memoirs of a Thieving, Conniving, Murdering, Stealing, Cheating Motherfucker""."
309,309,4,Jeremy,False,38,"No, of course not. I'm just gonna go to the hotel, say goodbye to Mum. Tell her I've never loved her, wish her ""bon voyage"", all that. Look Mark, I'm just saying goodbye. I am a human being."
310,310,4,Jeremy,True,3,"Shut up, Mum."
311,311,4,Jeremy,False,46,"No, no, it's fine, Mum. Really. Super Hans says the band's been getting a lot of interest. And I might write a porn film with a proper story and everything, so, lot of good opportunities. This is a nice room. Mind if I have a look?"
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,14,"If they can't get to Corfu, Mark, they can't spend my money. That's physics."
313,313,4,Jeremy,False,20,"No, Mark. I'm not gonna let them run off with my money. That's why Gunny's going on a little holiday."
314,314,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh fuck off, Mark. You're not Taggart."
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,12,"I'm not aiming it at you, I was just stretching my arm."
316,316,4,Jeremy,True,3,He's abducting Gunny.
317,317,4,Jeremy,True,13,"Deactivated. It's like he's told me my cock doesn't work, poor deactivated Gunny."
318,318,4,Jeremy,False,3,Natalie raped Mark!
319,319,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Go on, Mark. Tell Martin what happened."
320,320,4,Jeremy,False,13,And I'm telling the police and the papers unless I get my money.
321,321,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Don't let her off, Mark. She's OJ, she's guilty as fuck. Tell the truth."
322,322,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Well, Mummy's gone. So you're my mummy again now."
323,323,4,Jeremy,True,11,And I'm gonna have to suck on your dry teat forever.
324,324,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh man, record company meeting. Finally."
325,325,5,Jeremy,False,21,"Yeah, but we've got an in, Pej's sister's mate in the legal department. Once you're inside legal, that's it. Game over."
326,326,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Chemical Brothers, wow."
327,327,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, see. I was so right to get us on the Internet. The Internet's going to be massive, I keep telling you."
328,328,5,Jeremy,False,1,Oh.
329,329,5,Jeremy,False,13,I'm a very sexual performer. Are you gonna be able to handle that?
330,330,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, OK."
331,331,5,Jeremy,True,15,"Wow, we've finally met the man. And the man is a woman. And he's hot!"
332,332,5,Jeremy,False,22,"I don't know, it's hard to tell. I mean, she looks like how you might think one of them might look like."
333,333,5,Jeremy,False,3,She scares me.
334,334,5,Jeremy,False,5,Let's fucking go for it!
335,335,5,Jeremy,True,17,"God, we're so horny. We're like a pair of porn stars who aren't on antidepressants or anything."
336,336,5,Jeremy,False,2,That's right.
337,337,5,Jeremy,False,8,I guess so. I am a bit magic.
338,338,5,Jeremy,True,96,"OK, here we go. God, we are so hot after the cab. I wonder if I'll be able to do all the stuff she was whispering in my ear. Might need a good foothold somewhere, or a harness. Is this a good idea? Drunk sex with my new manager? Yeah, yeah. It's probably a good idea. They'd only be a problem if there were complications. There aren't gonna be complications, relax. Oh wow, this is definitely happening. OK, got to focus. It's very important for my future career development that I give my manager an orgasm."
339,339,5,Jeremy,True,88,"OK, well. I'd like a bit more foreplay but apparently I have to perform on demand. Don't be bitter, this has got to be great. Brilliant sex then novelty bong. Then watch a film together. If Mark's got around to buying a new SCART lead that is. Maybe if we got another SCART lead, I could use it to plug the digibox into the VHS player. Record straight onto that? Or, I could use the analogue aerial into the video, and off that, well maybe switch around the-"
340,340,5,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
341,341,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Y- er, yes?"
342,342,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, I... I thought it was."
343,343,5,Jeremy,False,17,"Well, um, now we're talking about it, it is maybe withering under the lights a little bit."
344,344,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Do you think? If you want, I can put a finger-"
345,345,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, OK."
346,346,5,Jeremy,True,29,"Ugh, this is like the time I made Mark turn that boring DVD off in the middle. The Killing Fields. This is probably how he felt. Frustrated, and horny."
347,347,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, yeah."
348,348,5,Jeremy,False,7,Really? Festivus? I'm playing the Wolverhampton Festivus?
349,349,5,Jeremy,False,47,"Oh my God Mark, I'm in the money. Everything's going to be all right, I am gonna be a legend. And you, and all of this depressing shit, will just be a little footnote in the massive biog of how rich and fucked up I eventually became."
350,350,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh man, we're actually going on tour."
351,351,5,Jeremy,False,8,"So, what sort of stash have you brought?"
352,352,5,Jeremy,False,11,Cool. What's those? Something a bit red hot for down time?
353,353,5,Jeremy,False,22,"But... no Mark, we're going on tour. We're going to get fucked up and monged out, and messed up and dicked over."
354,354,5,Jeremy,False,29,"Yeah, if you start working for the Gestapo. Look man, we're a rock band, yeah? If people see us hanging out with a doink like you, not being rude..."
355,355,5,Jeremy,False,12,...then that takes away a hell of a lot of our credibility.
356,356,5,Jeremy,False,22,"This is because of Cally, isn't it? That's why you want to come. You're trying to have a pop at the champ."
357,357,5,Jeremy,False,21,"All right, you can come. But all the time while we're on tour, you will need to shut up. All right?"
358,358,5,Jeremy,False,1,What?
359,359,5,Jeremy,False,9,Christian? You've booked us to play a Jesus fest?
360,360,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah, but we're cool. We've got credibility. If we play a Jesus gig, we'll be selling our souls."
361,361,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Well I vote no, let's call it off."
362,362,5,Jeremy,False,36,Well from a business point of view... since when did the roadie have voting rights? I don't come around to your work and tell you how to run your sweatshops in Burma. Keep your beak out.
363,363,5,Jeremy,False,7,I think you made the right decision.
364,364,5,Jeremy,True,12,Two litres of supermarket cola. I'd like to see Sting do this.
365,365,5,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah, man. It's not such a drag the fest being strictly drink and drugs free after all, is it?"
366,366,5,Jeremy,False,6,"What are you-? Hans, are you...?"
367,367,5,Jeremy,False,1,Safe.
368,368,5,Jeremy,True,4,"Mmm, sexy Christian disciples."
369,369,5,Jeremy,False,6,Groupies. What are you gonna do?
370,370,5,Jeremy,False,8,"She spoke to the group, she's a groupie."
371,371,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Hey, hold on girls. We're gonna make a spliff out of nutmeg and banana peel."
372,372,5,Jeremy,False,13,"Hey Mark, I just got baptised. This is Ronnie, he was my baptiser."
373,373,5,Jeremy,False,2,Thanks Ronnie.
374,374,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah, peace be with you too Ronnie."
375,375,5,Jeremy,False,71,"Yeah the organisers were pretty keen for me to get it done before the show. Initially, I was a bit iffy. But then I thought, you know, gig in front of hundreds of people. Fuck it. Plus, there's like maybe a one percent chance that the whole Jesus thing could be true - sorry Ronnie - in which case, I got something to pull out of the bag on judgement day."
376,376,5,Jeremy,False,35,"You know what? I'm really looking forward to the gig tonight after all. If Super Hans is into it, then I'm into it. Everything's finally coming together, and everything's finally definitely going to be OK."
377,377,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Me, out of the band? What the fuck?"
378,378,5,Jeremy,False,17,"You're screwing Cally? I'm out of the band? They can't just do this to me, can they?"
379,379,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Well, you'll have to break up with her."
380,380,5,Jeremy,False,14,"She's trying to shaft me Mark. You've got to dump her, it's a no-brainer."
381,381,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh, you're fine mate. Just stick with missionary. You're a sexual civilian. Leave the disgusting stuff to me."
382,382,5,Jeremy,False,23,"That's cheating. Anyone can please a woman if she tells you what to do. You're not allowed to ask, that's the whole point."
383,383,5,Jeremy,False,36,"Yeah, all right man. Whatever. Lets talk to Hans. If we can get him on side, then maybe you can keep your pathetic nookie lessons going. So, did Cally tell you about her and me, much?"
384,384,5,Jeremy,False,13,"Right, what the fuck's going on? Where's Cally? Why have you got drugs?"
385,385,5,Jeremy,False,13,Cally told Mark I'm out of the band. What the hell's going on?
386,386,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Right, so are you going to walk?"
387,387,5,Jeremy,False,5,But we are the band.
388,388,5,Jeremy,False,4,Now you're saying it.
389,389,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Right. If that's the way it is, fine. Can I take a bit of drugs?"
390,390,5,Jeremy,False,2,Fucking hell.
391,391,5,Jeremy,False,27,"I've got to talk to Cally. Talk her round. You can be my spin doctor. Tell her why I'm brilliant, why I'm so essential to the band."
392,392,5,Jeremy,False,2,Cally? Cally?
393,393,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Or, we could piss on something."
394,394,5,Jeremy,False,32,"Yes Mark. Come on, it's all fucked. This is rock 'n' roll. She screwed me over and now it's her turn. Let's fuck this place up! We're the hammer of the gods!"
395,395,5,Jeremy,True,6,"Oh yeah, take that teabag tin."
396,396,5,Jeremy,False,10,"She smashed my dreams, let's smash her caravan. Come on."
397,397,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, this feels good. This just feels so right, you know?"
398,398,5,Jeremy,False,26,"Oh yeah man, no. You go. I'm gonna stay. I wanna see the look on her face. Ha ha, no one screws with the Jez man."
399,399,5,Jeremy,True,22,"Christian security? What's he gonna do, excommunicate me? Yeah, this is going to be good. Rub her double crossing face in it."
400,400,5,Jeremy,False,4,I'm sure you have.
401,401,5,Jeremy,False,5,He's talked about that before.
402,402,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Well, yes."
403,403,5,Jeremy,False,6,"But, there's something you should know."
404,404,5,Jeremy,True,6,Am I actually gonna do this?
405,405,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Mark, he went mental."
406,406,5,Jeremy,True,3,It's a mess.
407,407,5,Jeremy,False,26,"Yeah, this is classic Mark I'm afraid. He does this sort of thing the whole time. He's passive aggressive. He won't say anything, he just smashes."
408,408,5,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah, he hates the skulls. He smashed it and then cut his hand in a kind of... mad fury."
409,409,5,Jeremy,False,38,"Well, he hates being told what to do in bed. He hates you for pushing me out of the band. I was like ""dude, these things happen"". But he was like ""Noooooo"". That's when he did the eggs."
410,410,5,Jeremy,False,24,Yup. He's weird. Twisted. Vindictive. He draws horrible cartoons of you and then wraps them up in sausage meat and calls you a sausage-muncher.
411,411,5,Jeremy,False,17,"On the bright side, he wanted to shit on the sofa, but I managed to stop him."
412,412,5,Jeremy,True,23,First proper gig. Dicked over Mark but that's fine. This is worth it. He's what it's all about. He's having a great time.
413,413,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, hi, Mark."
414,414,6,Jeremy,False,11,Cool. I'm glad you've had such an amazing day. That's great.
415,415,6,Jeremy,False,9,I've just been doing a lot of thinking lately.
416,416,6,Jeremy,False,20,"And I was just thinking, why do I even do half the stupid shit I do? Maybe I'm a knobhead."
417,417,6,Jeremy,False,29,"Maybe I'm not in the one percent of people who think they're gonna be successful musicians and are totally right, but in the ninety-nine percent of talentless, misguided dickheads."
418,418,6,Jeremy,False,33,"Maybe. Should we wait until the kids have gone? Hey, look. That other one's talking to those freaks who tried to push us their personality test. Look at that bloody ""New Wellness"" loony."
419,419,6,Jeremy,False,11,Freak out the freaks. Might also be quite warm in there.
420,420,6,Jeremy,True,21,"Yeah, this is gonna be funny. I'm gonna freak the fuck out of this sheep. He'll probably walk out worshipping me!"
421,421,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, OK."
422,422,6,Jeremy,True,11,"I'll tell you what's unlocking your true potential, mate. That tie."
423,423,6,Jeremy,True,4,I'll fuck with him.
424,424,6,Jeremy,False,1,No.
425,425,6,Jeremy,True,6,"Actually, it's more of a yes."
426,426,6,Jeremy,False,13,"No. I mean, yes. But no. No. It's a no, the answer's no."
427,427,6,Jeremy,True,5,What was my plan again?
428,428,6,Jeremy,True,1,Losers.
429,429,6,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
430,430,6,Jeremy,True,2,Fuck you.
431,431,6,Jeremy,False,2,Not particularly.
432,432,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Well, you know, my dad left home when I was ten, so..."
433,433,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Don't know, just... don't go? Don't go."
434,434,6,Jeremy,True,4,This is a laugh.
435,435,6,Jeremy,False,18,"I thought I knew what I was doing with my life, but I haven't got a fucking clue."
436,436,6,Jeremy,True,8,This is funny. This is definitely pretty funny.
437,437,6,Jeremy,False,24,"I'm sorry to bother you at work. I just wanted to apologise. I take and take and take, and I never give anything back."
438,438,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Yes, I'm fine. I just need you to know that I'm selfish and irresponsible, and I need to take ownership of that fact."
439,439,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Yep, doing good. See you later."
440,440,6,Jeremy,False,41,"Hey Mark, just to let you know, I've cleaned the kitchen, so don't go in there for a bit. The floor's still drying. And I've been to Tesco to stock up on milk and bread. We were running a bit low."
441,441,6,Jeremy,False,14,"The kitchen. See you later. I'm off out today and tomorrow, to my course."
442,442,6,Jeremy,False,25,"Yeah, it's for personal and career development. Did the first day yesterday. Best four hundred quid I've ever spent. Plus you get a free book."
443,443,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Yes, that's right. There's a conspiracy about them on the internet."
444,444,6,Jeremy,False,34,"Yeah, it's all based on the seven sacred truths from the golden tablets found in the asteroid which crashed in Siberia in 1911. It's a really great book. You'd love the chapter on Orgones."
445,445,6,Jeremy,False,28,Orgones are the invisible molecules of universal life energy which govern our moods and our actions. Negative Orgones are the source of all the problems in the world.
446,446,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Well, how do you explain all the problems in the world?"
447,447,6,Jeremy,False,6,Exactly. You haven't got a clue.
448,448,6,Jeremy,False,12,"I'd say that sounds fascinating, please tell me more. See you later."
449,449,6,Jeremy,False,19,"The good news is that in my last personality chart, I was thirty percent up, which was pretty wicked."
450,450,6,Jeremy,False,9,Yeah. What do you think about the asteroids stuff?
451,451,6,Jeremy,False,7,"No. God, no. More sort of thoughts."
452,452,6,Jeremy,False,2,True enough.
453,453,6,Jeremy,False,5,That is a good system.
454,454,6,Jeremy,True,30,"Move into the compound? Mark will say I'm joining a cult. But then, he won't have a Nectar card because he thinks it means they've ""got him"". I'm moving on."
455,455,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Dude, crank up the Orgonometer and bring on module two!"
456,456,6,Jeremy,False,1,Jared.
457,457,6,Jeremy,False,8,"You're not trying to deprogram me, are you?"
458,458,6,Jeremy,False,26,"Er, what, when we did the thing that we shouldn't have done, but which at the time, for a while, we really, really wanted to do?"
459,459,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah, I don't feel great about that. I don't really want to do that again."
460,460,6,Jeremy,False,5,Knocked up with Mark's kid.
461,461,6,Jeremy,False,16,"So, what? It's not gonna get born... old, or... young? But they come young anyway, so-"
462,462,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, you're fucking kidding. Oh, no. No!"
463,463,6,Jeremy,False,8,Yeah. It's exciting. I'm glad you told me.
464,464,6,Jeremy,True,21,I so wish you hadn't told me. Everything was brilliant before I knew and I was joining the cult. Not cult.
465,465,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Of course I will, Soph."
466,466,6,Jeremy,True,18,"I'll send Mark a note. A nice card with a stork, and a love rat. And a fiver."
467,467,6,Jeremy,True,7,"Could text him. A friendly, anonymous text."
468,468,6,Jeremy,False,18,"So this is exciting. I'm moving into the centre, and you're gonna have your wife and your family."
469,469,6,Jeremy,False,1,Uh-huh.
470,470,6,Jeremy,True,17,"Should tell him. God, I feel terrible. Where the heck did all these negative Orgones come from?"
471,471,6,Jeremy,False,4,"OK, well, um, bye."
472,472,6,Jeremy,False,5,There was just one thing.
473,473,6,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah, thanks, man. Um, no, the thing is, it's just... um... me and Sophie might be having a baby."
474,474,6,Jeremy,False,21,"No Mark, me and Sophie might be having a baby. About a month ago, when she came round, we ended up..."
475,475,6,Jeremy,False,13,I'm so sorry. But it's not for certain. It might still be yours.
476,476,6,Jeremy,False,3,Are you angry?
477,477,6,Jeremy,False,29,"Right. It's such a relief to tell you. God, it's been ever so weird ever since it happened. I've had this really bad feeling, like, in my brain, and-"
478,478,6,Jeremy,False,22,"What? Oh God, no. No, it's a much bigger journey than that. Although, I did join up the day after it happened."
479,479,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Uh, sure. It's just I've been having a talk with Mark and well, basically, I might have a big think about the move."
480,480,6,Jeremy,False,13,Could you please stop agreeing that I'm a dickhead? I'm not a dickhead.
481,481,6,Jeremy,False,7,"No, Super Hans, not the new TV."
482,482,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Hans, no!"
483,483,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Right, that is it, Hans. Fuck off. Just fuck off, all right?"
484,484,6,Jeremy,True,15,"Oh God, he's broken a TV. I might be a father. He's broken a TV!"
485,485,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Jesus, man, I am so sorry."
486,486,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
487,487,6,Jeremy,False,5,And what about the... issue?
488,488,6,Jeremy,False,8,Right! Who knows? Who the fuck even cares?
489,489,6,Jeremy,True,2,"Oh, Jesus."
490,490,1,Mark,True,14,So unhappy. I wonder if anyone has ever been this unhappy while drinking champagne?
491,491,1,Mark,False,8,"That's the last bottle, OK? I'm saving it."
492,492,1,Mark,False,7,No... what's she like? Is she sexy?
493,493,1,Mark,False,21,"It's too early. I'm not into it. No, I'm still technically married. I'm not safe to be reintroduced into society yet."
494,494,1,Mark,False,36,"God, no. No, it's too early. No, cancel! Call her back and cancel. Tell her the whole story. Although... tell me more about her. What's she like? Is she sexy? She's not too sexy, is she?"
495,495,1,Mark,False,11,Are you sure this isn't going to be a nightmare encounter?
496,496,1,Mark,False,2,A play?
497,497,1,Mark,False,4,The Megatron? But... no.
498,498,1,Mark,False,35,"Friends of the British Museum magazine. Clearly, I'm not a Johnny Depp, Tony Parsons hunk of the month. I need my props. I have my rituals. Magazine under the arm, Old Meg in the wallet."
499,499,1,Mark,True,5,Still two years off expiry.
500,500,1,Mark,False,31,"Oh my God, look at her. She's perfect! I love her, Jez. I don't know if I can do this. You stay, I'm gonna go home. Tell her I love her."
501,501,1,Mark,True,13,Maybe she's the one. My marriage was just a warm-up for the one.
502,502,1,Mark,False,1,Hi.
503,503,1,Mark,True,8,Jeremy was right. She is an actual woman.
504,504,1,Mark,False,24,"Well, I'm no expert but if it's old and involves swords, I'm basically interested. I could get us tickets, if that wasn't incredibly forward."
505,505,1,Mark,False,15,"Well, it is to the shit-munchers, but I'm actually a Friend of the British Museum."
506,506,1,Mark,True,15,"Oh, my God! I've already closed on a second date. This magazine is sexual dynamite!"
507,507,1,Mark,False,27,"As far as I can make out, we get to go out, for a bit, in an hour. Then we have to come back for two hours."
508,508,1,Mark,False,9,"If this was on television, nobody would be watching."
509,509,1,Mark,False,10,I can't believe coming here cost more than a film.
510,510,1,Mark,False,8,I'm going to pretend I am watching Heat.
511,511,1,Mark,False,4,We're on a date!
512,512,1,Mark,False,6,But I'm back on the horse!
513,513,1,Mark,False,3,"No, I can't!"
514,514,1,Mark,True,16,He's leaving me with two women. I can't date two women! I can barely date one!
515,515,1,Mark,True,52,"Can't believe Jeremy left me to soak up bad feeling like a hate sponge. Lucky I'd already nailed a second date. Maybe she is the one. This time, try to definitely decide before doing a wedding. Shit! What, break-in? Hope he's not been murdered. I bet he has, that would be typical!"
516,516,1,Mark,False,1,Jeremy?
517,517,1,Mark,False,4,Have we been burgled?
518,518,1,Mark,False,10,Have you called the locksmith? Have the police already been?
519,519,1,Mark,False,6,"Why haven't you done anything, Jeremy?"
520,520,1,Mark,False,10,"Shit. They've taken my digital camera, my watch, my iPod!"
521,521,1,Mark,False,25,The PlayStation! The memory card! I'd nearly broken through on Medal of Honour! They've nicked a hundred and twenty hours of quality me-time! Bloody hell!
522,522,1,Mark,False,5,What? You've finally caught VD.
523,523,1,Mark,False,11,"Still, bit of a pisser having to call all your exes?"
524,524,1,Mark,False,9,You are going to call your exes? Big Suze?
525,525,1,Mark,False,5,"Jeremy, it makes women infertile."
526,526,1,Mark,False,7,Oh my God. They did a shit.
527,527,1,Mark,False,13,"I think it's nerves, or marking their territory. Look, it's sort of all..."
528,528,1,Mark,True,50,"The big date and she's forty-five minutes late. Great. I'm getting pitying smiles. Still, got the phone. You're never alone with a phone. Look at that. No calls. Everyone I know doesn't want to talk to me. Why isn't she texting? Maybe she's dead. Bereaved is better than stood up."
529,529,1,Mark,True,55,"Oh, everyone in that restaurant knew I'd been stood up. I'd feel better if she had had an accident. I could go to hospital. I might get to switch off the machine. Would that be good? Married one, killed one. I'd be a pint-sized Henry VIII. That's her! Maybe I should hide. Actually, fuck it!"
530,530,1,Mark,False,3,"Heather! Hello, Heather."
531,531,1,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh?
532,532,1,Mark,True,13,"Oh yeah, course it is. I'm just the man you wanted to see."
533,533,1,Mark,True,2,Almost plausible.
534,534,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
535,535,1,Mark,True,8,I'm going to have my pound of date.
536,536,1,Mark,False,21,"No, it's not too late. Let's go for a drink. We were going to have a date, let's have a date."
537,537,1,Mark,False,1,No.
538,538,1,Mark,False,22,"Look, we're right by my place. We could always have a drink up there if you didn't think it'd be too weird."
539,539,1,Mark,True,27,"Hmm, she's coming back to my place. She trusts me. It's still possible she stood me up, but she almost definitely doesn't consider me a physical threat."
540,540,1,Mark,False,21,"I'm really glad that we did manage to meet up, 'cause I don't know what I'd have done with this otherwise."
541,541,1,Mark,False,11,It really is the only book you need on samurai culture...
542,542,1,Mark,True,8,that I could find for under fifteen quid.
543,543,1,Mark,True,7,"Oh, yeah, getting kissed by the one!"
544,544,1,Mark,False,11,"Oh, look at this, Jeremy left the bloody door on the..."
545,545,1,Mark,False,2,Jeremy! Hello?
546,546,1,Mark,False,3,What are you...?
547,547,1,Mark,False,3,Kenny's not here.
548,548,1,Mark,False,1,No.
549,549,1,Mark,True,7,"Oh my God, what am I doing?"
550,550,1,Mark,False,4,"Hey, hey. No, no."
551,551,1,Mark,True,11,I'm wrestling with the white working class. Morse never did this.
552,552,1,Mark,False,3,Just shut up!
553,553,1,Mark,True,4,I'm better than Morse!
554,554,1,Mark,True,3,"Oh, yeah, baby!"
555,555,1,Mark,False,7,"Yeah, well my home is my castle."
556,556,1,Mark,False,20,You were coming back for what you didn't get last week! That's my bloody watch! You've got my watch on!
557,557,1,Mark,False,26,"Police, please. Yes, I've apprehended a burglar. Flat 5, Apollo House, London Road, Croydon. Forty-five minutes?! But... I'm, I'm sitting on him. Is that legal? OK."
558,558,1,Mark,False,10,"Look, if you want, we can do this another time."
559,559,1,Mark,False,37,"Well that's great. I mean I think I'm OK with him, but it'd be good to have someone else there with a bottle or a spanner to bonk him on the head with if he tries anything."
560,560,1,Mark,False,2,Thank you.
561,561,1,Mark,False,24,It's good to get a foot on the ladder. Plus I've got pension provision coming out of my arse. There's wine in the fridge.
562,562,1,Mark,True,22,"This is actually turning out pretty well. This could be a funny family story. ""We met when he sat on a burglar."""
563,563,1,Mark,False,3,It's a burglar!
564,564,1,Mark,False,4,"Oh, the plot thickens."
565,565,1,Mark,False,19,"Oh that's right, take his side! You've only known me fifteen years, whereas him, he's a pillar of society."
566,566,1,Mark,False,32,"Look Heather, can you watch him? I'll double lock the door, and then... we can all go through into the living room and just... all keep an eye on him there, OK?"
567,567,1,Mark,False,14,"I think, Jeremy, that he's going to try and nick our stuff, all right?"
568,568,1,Mark,False,9,"Oh for God's sake, Jeremy, don't try to bond."
569,569,1,Mark,False,26,"Look, let's just try and continue our evening as if he wasn't here and if he tries to escape I'll just have to... take him down."
570,570,1,Mark,True,6,I've got balls like baked potatoes.
571,571,1,Mark,False,26,"Look, shut up! You are not part of this conversation! Look, this is... this is too weird. Let's lock him away somewhere until the police arrive."
572,572,1,Mark,False,7,He might do a shit in there.
573,573,1,Mark,True,8,"Oh, the Megatron is shrinking my massive balls."
574,574,1,Mark,False,10,"That, what is... that? Did you do that? You're sick!"
575,575,1,Mark,False,20,Guess we could tie him up in the bath but... might feel like we'd crossed a bit of a line.
576,576,1,Mark,False,9,"We're not going to burn him. Suze, that's horrible!"
577,577,1,Mark,False,18,"Look, I think the best thing for you is if we just stick you out on the balcony."
578,578,1,Mark,False,16,There's no human right to be dry. You have a good look for Kenny out there.
579,579,1,Mark,True,10,That felt good! Maybe I should join the prison service.
580,580,1,Mark,False,18,Jeremy. Since when are you on a date with Big Suze? What about the chlamydia? Didn't she mind?
581,581,1,Mark,False,33,"Oh my God, you haven't told her! You're disgusting! According to Johnson they're not even definitely broken up. I won't let you do this, Jeremy! If necessary, I will stand physically between you."
582,582,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, God...!"
583,583,1,Mark,True,3,Guantanamo is compromised!
584,584,1,Mark,False,7,Give me that. Who are you phoning?
585,585,1,Mark,False,8,"No, the police will be here soon, Jeremy."
586,586,1,Mark,False,6,We've got to tough it out.
587,587,1,Mark,True,32,"Great, it's me protecting civilisation again while Jeremy has sex. If this was the war, I'd be getting shot by Rommel while he was in Paris getting a blowjob from a Nazi."
588,588,1,Mark,False,9,"Sorry it's been such a weird evening. Memorable, though."
589,589,1,Mark,True,8,Maybe I can raise the temperature a bit?
590,590,1,Mark,False,7,"So... Here we are, on bed together."
591,591,1,Mark,True,3,Bit too much?
592,592,1,Mark,False,18,"Look at that... look how much bigger my feet are than yours. I'm not boasting, they just are."
593,593,1,Mark,True,6,"Oh yeah, now she's getting hot."
594,594,1,Mark,False,11,"Ignore the banging and threats, Heather. Relax and have some cheese."
595,595,1,Mark,True,3,Is cheese relaxing?
596,596,1,Mark,False,10,"No, Jeremy, that's not how I roll. You know that."
597,597,1,Mark,True,33,"God, she's lovely. But how do I take it to the next level? Boast about the size of my hands? Tell her she might be the one? What have I got to lose?"
598,598,1,Mark,False,27,"Yeah, I guess you probably should. But there is the mob, so the mob probably means you can't actually go just yet. Shall I top you up?"
599,599,1,Mark,True,2,"Thanks, mob."
600,600,1,Mark,False,6,"What the- what's going on, Jeremy!?"
601,601,1,Mark,False,3,"Stop! Stop, thieves!"
602,602,1,Mark,False,12,"The front door was locked! You let them in, didn't you Jeremy!"
603,603,1,Mark,False,10,"Then how did he open the door, for fuck's sake?"
604,604,1,Mark,True,7,"Right, you shit, it's mutually assured destruction."
605,605,1,Mark,False,27,"Suze, I'm afraid to have to inform you that Jeremy has, or may have, a sexually transmitted disease. I'm sorry I had to tell you, but he-"
606,606,1,Mark,False,3,You can't go.
607,607,1,Mark,False,26,"The police will be here any minute, and I'm not telling them I let the burglar go. That's your job. You're an accessory to the crime."
608,608,1,Mark,False,13,"Jeremy, if you try anything I will take you down. I'm not afraid."
609,609,1,Mark,False,7,I'm doing what I've got to do.
610,610,1,Mark,False,2,"No, Jeremy."
611,611,1,Mark,False,19,"OK, all right I'm not going to hurt you, I'm just keeping you here until the police arrive, OK?"
612,612,1,Mark,False,4,I'm confiscating your keys.
613,613,1,Mark,False,15,"No, no, we're having a date. We can still date. You owe me a date."
614,614,1,Mark,False,14,Twenty minutes. It's too soon. You can't go yet. I won't let you go.
615,615,1,Mark,False,7,"Look, I wanted to tell you something."
616,616,1,Mark,False,17,"I thought that you might be... the one. But, but I guess, probably not, so... ..good night."
617,617,1,Mark,False,3,"Fuck off, Jeremy"
618,618,2,Mark,False,33,"You know Jez, I've started to get this feeling that I'm totally, totally fucked. You know? Everything's fucked. I fucked my wedding, I fucked up my only ever relationship. Everything's just completely fucked."
619,619,2,Mark,False,36,"But now I'm starting to think that maybe that's good thing. 'Cause now I can get on and do everything I've always wanted to do. Join Mensa, learn the clarinet. I could be a scout leader."
620,620,2,Mark,False,27,"What are you smiling for? Look, scouting is a noble tradition. You do not have to be a paedo to want to work with children, all right?"
621,621,2,Mark,False,17,"Oh God, that is so- I spent five happy years in the scouts and I never once-"
622,622,2,Mark,False,44,"Yeah, all right, Layton was a bit of a paedo but, not in a bad way, just boosting you over the climbing wall, making you run around the camp in your pants. It was old style paedo-ing, before it got such a bad name."
623,623,2,Mark,True,14,"Of course, Layton only really had eyes for Duncan Carpenter, the doe-eyed little flirt."
624,624,2,Mark,True,7,"Mmm, why toast when you can roast?"
625,625,2,Mark,False,5,What's nicer than a roast?
626,626,2,Mark,False,3,Who was that?
627,627,2,Mark,False,1,Barney?
628,628,2,Mark,False,41,"Oh, what? Really? Heartbreak tuna? Oh no, Jez just bin it. I mean not literally, there's no need to be overly dramatic. Freeze it. See how I feel in six months. So they came all this way just for the tuna?"
629,629,2,Mark,False,39,"Sophie's going back to work! But that's outside the terms of the treaty! Six weeks! Six weeks till we go back. This isn't six weeks, this is three! Shit, I've got to get in there to stop her lies."
630,630,2,Mark,False,7,That I jilted her at the altar.
631,631,2,Mark,False,9,"I did not jilt her, technically I married her."
632,632,2,Mark,False,47,"Oh shit, if you think that, what's everyone else gonna think? Oh God, I've got to get in there. If she wants a PR war, she can have a PR war. I'll Mandelson her. Nobody wanted New Labour, Jeremy, but now we all know how it works."
633,633,2,Mark,True,104,"Walking into the jaws of death. Gotta go past Sophie's desk. What am I gonna say? Please save me, Jesus. I'll believe in you if you save me now. The other way, she's looking the other way! Thank you, Jesus! Although it was 50/50 which way she'd be looking. Might need a bit more to start believing. Oh, the gossip mill, that's right, stare at Hess, throw fruit at Hess, pacing his prison yard. Mmm, piggin' tea break, cup of piggin' tea and work out my piggin' campaign strategy. Oh knickers, here we go, Lisa. She's not saying anything! Brilliant! Good old English reserve."
634,634,2,Mark,False,2,"Oh, OK."
635,635,2,Mark,True,8,That's fair. Lisa is a very fair person.
636,636,2,Mark,True,117,"OK, grab your nuts Corrigan, first contact. There she is, Sophie. Should I go over, forget the spin war? Apologise? Stab myself with a fork? They only have plastic. Oh crying, yes nice. That's going to play very well with the floating voters. Nice tears, Goebbels. Her and her mates will probably start handing out vicious cartoons of me as a rodent in a big top hat and everyone will think it's hilarious until a mob comes round and smashes my shop window. At least I've got off the roast wagon. Oh God, there she goes. This is a public relations nightmare. Where do I sit? This must be what it's like being a nonce in prison."
637,637,2,Mark,False,8,"Hello, is it OK if I go here?"
638,638,2,Mark,True,8,Please don't call me a piece of shit.
639,639,2,Mark,False,13,"Are you new? I don't think I've seen you here before, have I?"
640,640,2,Mark,False,16,"Oh, right. I'm Mark but you've probably heard of me under some other horrible abusive name."
641,641,2,Mark,False,33,"Oh, no, just everyone abuses everyone now, don't they? ""Fuck off"", ""fuck off you wanker."" It's supposed to be funny but of course it's not. Wow, you carry personal cheese. Is that allowed?"
642,642,2,Mark,False,1,Right.
643,643,2,Mark,True,29,"If I was seen sharing cheese with a woman it could be misinterpreted. My approval rating would drop through the floor. Plus, looks like she might gnaw on it."
644,644,2,Mark,False,22,"I'm fine, I think if I ate anything with any flavour in this room my body would probably spasm due to shock."
645,645,2,Mark,False,18,"Oh, by the way, is it possible to easily put a block on a couple of email addresses?"
646,646,2,Mark,False,5,"Oh, nothing, just some crap."
647,647,2,Mark,False,5,It's just mates and that.
648,648,2,Mark,False,4,"Yeah, they're pretty funny."
649,649,2,Mark,False,1,Oh!
650,650,2,Mark,True,35,"That's a good joke, she's nice, she's being nice. I'm pathetically grateful. Maybe I should ask her out for a drink. She is a floating voter. Plus, she's weirdly attractive. No, don't go there, Clinton."
651,651,2,Mark,False,12,"Hey. Barney, is it? What are you doing here, what's going on?"
652,652,2,Mark,False,1,What?
653,653,2,Mark,False,7,"Ah, no, I think I'm fine, actually."
654,654,2,Mark,False,12,"Jeremy, he's Sophie's cousin for God's sake! You're sleeping with the enemy."
655,655,2,Mark,False,26,Not even sure where you'd sign it. Is that meant to be a dotted line? Who drew this up? A lot of these aren't proper sentences.
656,656,2,Mark,False,3,The Fuck Bunker.
657,657,2,Mark,False,8,"All right, fine, I don't give a shit."
658,658,2,Mark,False,9,"Looks good to me, Barney. Go for it, dude."
659,659,2,Mark,False,7,"He's not sucking you off, is he?"
660,660,2,Mark,False,19,You have to be very careful asking someone to get you a Twirl who would also suck you off.
661,661,2,Mark,True,20,"Got the nod, the mark of the human. I'm a human, you're a human, what else is there to say?"
662,662,2,Mark,False,2,"Dobby, likewise."
663,663,2,Mark,True,13,"God, there's an atmosphere. Sexual tension? Or just misfits scared of sexual tension?"
664,664,2,Mark,True,10,"Oh no, this is a disciplinary hearing waiting to happen."
665,665,2,Mark,False,8,"Yeah, sure. Erm, you'll- you'll have to... move."
666,666,2,Mark,True,8,Is she shifting her bum against my area?
667,667,2,Mark,False,11,Are you sure you don't wanna get out of the way?
668,668,2,Mark,True,24,"What if someone comes in? Should step away. Step away from the bum. Bit impolite to step away, I don't want to step away."
669,669,2,Mark,False,8,"Oh, feta? That's a sheep's cheese isn't it?"
670,670,2,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, I believe so. Or goat's."
671,671,2,Mark,True,93,"This is possibly the most exciting thing that has happened to anyone ever. Does she know what she's doing? Is she just innocently waggling her bum around and I'm getting illegal benefit? I'm not doing a sexual assault, am I? You can't do a sexual assault if you stay still like a statue. I'm just a statue, a dirty, filthy statue. Oh, God I'm getting very... Captain Corrigan is flying without a license! Oh, Jesus it's too much, I'm gonna blow my beans, I'm gonna do a Chesil Beach! Don't let her know."
672,672,2,Mark,False,25,"I'm fine, but sorry, I should be going 'cause you know, the world turns on its axis, one man works while another relaxes. Ah, Post-its."
673,673,2,Mark,True,62,"Uh, did she notice? Should have stayed for at least a snog but for some reason my interest level just dropped straight off. God, it's soggy down there. It's gonna start chafing. Need to clean up, need to get out. Shit, Elaine and Michael. They'll probably wanna talk quarterly sales. Fire exit. Could bust out here and out into the car park?"
674,674,2,Mark,True,1,Fuck!
675,675,2,Mark,False,3,"Hello, you two."
676,676,2,Mark,True,21,"Urgh, she's smoking a joint with her ex when we should be newlyweds remorselessly working our way through The Lovers' Guide."
677,677,2,Mark,False,9,"Hi Soph, how are you, how are you feeling?"
678,678,2,Mark,False,2,You do?
679,679,2,Mark,False,4,"That was funny, though."
680,680,2,Mark,False,3,"Yeah, maybe not..."
681,681,2,Mark,True,8,while I'm in spermy pants and you're high
682,682,2,Mark,False,1,...here.
683,683,2,Mark,True,5,"Oh God, it's seeping through."
684,684,2,Mark,False,14,"Er... yeah. Yeah, I- I did a little bit of wee on myself, so..."
685,685,2,Mark,True,23,"Oh yeah, they can laugh, but I win because they think I pissed myself. They've no clue I came all in my pants."
686,686,2,Mark,True,82,"Dobby, my cupboard lover. Stationery sex queen. I can't ask her out I'll be dead in the PR water. Oh, don't think about it, just drink buckets of tea. Piggin' tea break! ""Oops, butterfingers, your clumsy wife."" She has gone beyond now, that is too much. That is way over the line. Maybe I'll stick it back to ""Harpenden, Harpenden, Harpenden"". See how she likes that. No, can't we leave the mugs out of it? Even the mob never hit the families."
687,687,2,Mark,False,2,"Right, wow."
688,688,2,Mark,True,12,"Oh my God, this is piggin' massive. I've won the spin war."
689,689,2,Mark,False,7,"Smash it? Er, thank you, but no."
690,690,2,Mark,True,14,"Right, Dobby, who cares what people think? I'm back baby, the bitch is back."
691,691,2,Mark,False,17,"Hey, Dobs. I just wondered if you fancied coming down with me to The Fuck Bunker, and-"
692,692,2,Mark,False,32,"No, God no. No, no, it's a venue. My mate's playing a gig down there on Friday. I just thought it might be cool to swing by there and check it out."
693,693,2,Mark,True,12,"She's the one! Oh Dobby, let me chew on your weird hair."
694,694,2,Mark,False,10,"Two bottles of premium lager and two double whiskies, please."
695,695,2,Mark,True,4,Don't keep the change.
696,696,2,Mark,False,4,"Ah, good old alcohol."
697,697,2,Mark,False,12,"Long-term there's depression, lethargy and addiction but, who's looking to the long-term?"
698,698,2,Mark,True,4,What is he saying?
699,699,2,Mark,True,8,He's just talking words out of his mouth.
700,700,2,Mark,False,13,"Wow, the ladies. Nice to see it's almost as disguising as the gents."
701,701,2,Mark,False,4,"Of course, girl power."
702,702,2,Mark,True,30,"Wow, this is better than watching Jeremy dying on stage. She really seems to have a thing about confined spaces. Just hope I don't go off in my pants again."
703,703,2,Mark,False,17,"It's a nightclub, it's normal. She's probably on drugs, she's probably having the time of her life."
704,704,2,Mark,True,15,"Oh God, I know that boot. I know that foot. I know that crying sound."
705,705,2,Mark,False,6,"No, Dobby, hold on. No, Dobby!"
706,706,2,Mark,False,2,Hi Sophie.
707,707,2,Mark,False,2,"Uh-huh, yeah."
708,708,2,Mark,False,13,"She doesn't know what she's saying, she's off her head on street drugs."
709,709,2,Mark,False,5,What have you taken Sophie?
710,710,2,Mark,False,14,What are you even doing here? I thought you were staying with your parents.
711,711,2,Mark,False,2,"Soph, please."
712,712,2,Mark,False,12,We are a bit married but not properly. It was never consummated.
713,713,2,Mark,False,3,"But Dobby, I..."
714,714,2,Mark,True,10,I've been caught out like Angus Deayton or Harold Shipman.
715,715,2,Mark,False,4,"Well, thank you, Sophie."
716,716,2,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh.
717,717,2,Mark,True,3,My beautiful wife.
718,718,2,Mark,False,7,"I'm so sorry about all this, Ian."
719,719,2,Mark,True,26,"Ian, he is Ian, isn't he? Suppose now I've jilted his daughter I could call him Captain Cock Ring and it wouldn't make things any worse."
720,720,2,Mark,False,7,I'm not the one he sucked off.
721,721,2,Mark,True,13,"OK, what now? Go home and roast the shit out of some meat."
722,722,3,Mark,False,10,It's my birthday week so I'm being nice to myself.
723,723,3,Mark,False,25,I thought I'd throw a party and in advance of the party I'm gonna go speed dating. Be great to get a date lined up.
724,724,3,Mark,False,60,"Look at us Jez, we're letting our lives slip through our fingers. Maybe you don't care, but I need to get out there and I'm never gonna to meet a woman in a pub or a nightclub or an art gallery or a book shop, or any other formal or informal social gathering. Realistically it's just not going to happen."
725,725,3,Mark,False,20,"I don't know. It's a bit too much, but I'm hoping if I eat it quickly my stomach won't notice."
726,726,3,Mark,False,5,That is not my problem.
727,727,3,Mark,False,49,"Recognise this Jeremy? I went to get the Cherry Garcia out to defrost and look what I found inside. ""Look I know what you think happened and yes you're right, I have eaten all your ice cream."" This is it, this is the line, you have crossed the line."
728,728,3,Mark,False,41,"A sausage has gone! Oh my God Jeremy, a sausage is missing! Is this what it's come to? I've got to carry my food around with me now to stop you from- right well, I'm sorry you've driven me to this."
729,729,3,Mark,False,15,I'm making a list of all the household items that you have permission to consume.
730,730,3,Mark,False,24,"Toilet paper, OK. Soap, OK, but not shower gel, and no razors. If you're poor, grow a beard. Tea bags are allowed, within limits."
731,731,3,Mark,False,10,No making a pie out of tea or anything weird.
732,732,3,Mark,False,31,"You ate your nest egg? You're meant to sit on your nest egg till it hatches, not eat it like some greedy, mad chicken. Well, the solution's obvious. Get a job."
733,733,3,Mark,False,8,"So, do something else. Get on your bike."
734,734,3,Mark,False,42,"You have to pay rent Jeremy, that needs to happen. Put the sausage back! I'm deadly serious. You never pay any rent, if you start stealing from me as well, that's it. You'll have to move out. This is the final straw."
735,735,3,Mark,True,23,"Ugh, speed dating, that was horrible. No one else seemed to mind. Maybe this is the future. Three-minute date, three-minute fuck, three-minute marriage."
736,736,3,Mark,False,10,"Ah the results are in, what does the swingometer say?"
737,737,3,Mark,False,16,"What? None? But number 23 said she was definitely going to tick, that's a verbal contract!"
738,738,3,Mark,False,9,"Yeah speed dating, I'd be better off speed skating!"
739,739,3,Mark,True,50,"Doesn't really work, but she gets the point. I'm just another reject slowly slipping out of the gene pool to get hoovered up by the sex industry. Oh Saz. She implied she might be ticking. Maybe she did tick. Maybe the data wasn't collated correctly. Maybe she's my hanging chad."
740,740,3,Mark,False,3,Hi. Remember me?
741,741,3,Mark,False,10,"Mark, we had a three-minute date about fifteen minutes ago."
742,742,3,Mark,False,3,That's terrible. Budvar?
743,743,3,Mark,True,12,I'm buying her a drink! Gotta order before someone nicks my idea.
744,744,3,Mark,False,10,"Oh, Jez I didn't realise you'd be back so soon."
745,745,3,Mark,False,12,"Right, the thing is, it's not for you mate, it's for Saz."
746,746,3,Mark,False,11,"Saz is having that room, I've invited Saz to move in."
747,747,3,Mark,False,30,Not right away. You can stay on the sofa until you find a new place. But it's just not viable for you to take up a whole room for free.
748,748,3,Mark,False,7,A loaf of delicious Vogel linseed bread.
749,749,3,Mark,False,13,What's wrong with linseed bread and marzipan and Ryvita and radishes? It's continental.
750,750,3,Mark,False,47,"If you're going to steal my food Jeremy, I'd prefer you not to enjoy it, and not enjoying it myself is a small price to pay. Look if you had some career other than wanking into a cup, maybe you could buy food and pay the rent."
751,751,3,Mark,False,54,"Saz? Well, nothing, initially. But, Jeremy look the thing is, I think she might be the one. And I could never win with a woman like that on the sexual battlefield but, in here I can pipe in Barry White while she's asleep, pretend I need a back rub, fall asleep on her lap."
752,752,3,Mark,True,27,"OK, Sophie due over tomorrow for the breakup handover, nothing too heavy, olives, crisp breads, dips, these are the heartbreak snacks. No stew, ribs or chocolate dildos."
753,753,3,Mark,False,24,"Brilliant yeah, I was gonna ask if you might be able to make yourself scarce tomorrow night, I've got a bit of ex stuff."
754,754,3,Mark,False,5,"No no, I don't really-"
755,755,3,Mark,False,18,To be honest I don't really know where to get coke and I don't have a porno collection.
756,756,3,Mark,False,16,"Wow, this is great isn't it. Three fun loving girls in the flat, anything could happen."
757,757,3,Mark,False,3,Anything could happen.
758,758,3,Mark,False,4,Don't say it Jeremy.
759,759,3,Mark,False,15,"There's no need to actually say it, if you say it you'll break the spell."
760,760,3,Mark,False,14,"Good idea. This is probably their dealer, what shall I say to their dealer?"
761,761,3,Mark,False,1,Soph.
762,762,3,Mark,False,8,But we- the handover's not till tomorrow night.
763,763,3,Mark,False,15,"No look, I'll- I'll show you my diary. See, tomorrow night, you got it wrong."
764,764,3,Mark,False,1,No.
765,765,3,Mark,False,13,"Maybe we should stick to the appointed- OK I guess, if you're here."
766,766,3,Mark,True,10,"OK, let's try and keep this festival of recriminations brief."
767,767,3,Mark,False,10,"Ignore the girls, they're Jeremy's girls, they're not my girls."
768,768,3,Mark,False,23,"Thanks for my stuff, here's your stuff, it's so great that you could come round, I'll see you in the office I guess."
769,769,3,Mark,True,3,"No, not sitting!"
770,770,3,Mark,False,13,"No one's going to jerk me off, Sophie, it's just a stupid joke."
771,771,3,Mark,False,3,Please carry on.
772,772,3,Mark,False,4,"What? No, God no."
773,773,3,Mark,False,14,"Look I'm sorry, they're Australian, they think it's all fine. I'm so sorry Soph."
774,774,3,Mark,True,10,I don't even wanna put my tongue up anyone's arsehole.
775,775,3,Mark,True,50,"Ugh, so little sleep. Third night in a row. I'm living in Animal House. I don't wanna live in Animal House, I wanna live in one of the other houses. Little House on the Prairie? Hello. This is more like it. Sexy girl at breakfast, finally getting my bonus ball."
776,776,3,Mark,False,1,Morning.
777,777,3,Mark,True,25,Oh shit I'm out of my depth. What do I do? Put the kettle on? The sound of the kettle might drown out her tears.
778,778,3,Mark,True,7,This is my very own anti-drugs commercial.
779,779,3,Mark,False,5,I'll get you a tissue.
780,780,3,Mark,False,4,How are you doing?
781,781,3,Mark,False,9,I dunno... I just think they were laughing generally.
782,782,3,Mark,False,4,No. No I don't.
783,783,3,Mark,False,6,I might ask Saz to leave.
784,784,3,Mark,False,34,"So, er, Saz, listen I've been thinking, it's been really great having you here, but now you've done the South, the London Eye and the Trocadero so, you probably wanna be heading up north."
785,785,3,Mark,False,19,"But there's a Harvey Nichols in Leeds that everyone goes on about, as if that's the answer to something."
786,786,3,Mark,False,6,There's an Anzac memorial in Huddersfield.
787,787,3,Mark,False,3,You... like me?
788,788,3,Mark,False,12,"Wow OK so, I could tell people that you were my girlfriend?"
789,789,3,Mark,False,36,"Sure, but we could still have fun and watch, you know, Morse, and people could see us out together like at my birthday party on Friday? And I could put a photo of us on Facebook?"
790,790,3,Mark,False,11,Of course you can stay. Maybe this could be our song.
791,791,3,Mark,True,19,"OK well, money might not buy you love, but apparently a furnished flat can get you a reasonable simulation!"
792,792,3,Mark,False,7,She's actually not moving out straight away.
793,793,3,Mark,False,17,"Yes well, she's... she's not moving out because we are now a couple. We've started a relationship."
794,794,3,Mark,False,16,"You can't put a stopwatch on the human heart Jeremy. Romance just blossomed, in the kitchen."
795,795,3,Mark,False,6,"But, Jez where are you going?"
796,796,3,Mark,False,16,"But, Jez Suze is back with Johnson and Pej's houseboat's never gonna be released from Rotterdam!"
797,797,3,Mark,True,27,"Hope he'll be OK. I guess we're moving on. Yep, it's me and my hired concubine for a day of sterile conversation and sexual frustration. Unless I..."
798,798,3,Mark,False,7,"You don't, do you, fancy, a bit?"
799,799,3,Mark,False,3,Of course. Later.
800,800,3,Mark,True,47,"Oh Johnson, let me count the ways how I admire the organisational and interpersonal skills of thee. Right in front of me, nice. Reckon Sophie was almost definitely the one. Yep, as soon as she's horrible to me, realise I want her. Classic. The bloody lever's gone!"
801,801,3,Mark,False,6,Lever! Could you get the lever?!!
802,802,3,Mark,False,4,The lever's come off!
803,803,3,Mark,False,4,"Oh wow, oh God."
804,804,3,Mark,True,13,"Ugh, acute social embarrassment plus intense physical pain, I'm really pushing the envelope."
805,805,3,Mark,False,11,I don't know I was just looking at Sophie and then-
806,806,3,Mark,False,6,"Well I need the numbers, so..."
807,807,3,Mark,False,1,Nice.
808,808,3,Mark,False,1,Us?
809,809,3,Mark,True,14,"Ugh, got to choose. Nice geeky Dobby or Saz my prime time newsreader-type girlfriend."
810,810,3,Mark,False,13,"Dobby, listen that's lovely but, the thing is, I'm going with my girlfriend."
811,811,3,Mark,False,4,Don't so sound surprised.
812,812,3,Mark,True,24,"Did the right thing there. Pretty sure. Don't listen to your heart, that's what no-one tells you but that's probably the real grown-up truth."
813,813,3,Mark,True,16,"Dancing with my girlfriend at my party. Look at me now dad, look at me now."
814,814,3,Mark,False,2,Another drink?
815,815,3,Mark,True,13,Did she wince? That's not good. Wincing isn't mentioned by the romantic poets.
816,816,3,Mark,False,33,"Meat in the room Gerrard, meat in the room. Bottle of Becks please, and a vodka for my girlfriend, just leave my girlfriend's drinks here, I can give them to my girlfriend later."
817,817,3,Mark,False,12,Who knows? She could be the one. Love moves in mysterious ways.
818,818,3,Mark,False,29,"Oh yeah, yeah yeah she loves this one, this is one of her faves. Yep, there she goes, that's Saz, that is Saz all over, that is so her."
819,819,3,Mark,False,36,"Oh, hell, yeah yeah, she's just having a bit of fun. She's a minx isn't she, this is all a part of our whole thing. We'll probably go home after this and just really... you know..."
820,820,3,Mark,False,26,"Yes I've bloody seen what they're doing and it's fine, all right? It's cool Dobs. Let's have a funny one, do you have The Barron Knights?"
821,821,3,Mark,False,1,Jeremy?
822,822,3,Mark,False,2,What's... this?
823,823,3,Mark,False,3,"Wow, a violin?"
824,824,3,Mark,False,6,How did you afford this Jeremy?
825,825,3,Mark,True,2,Oh great.
826,826,3,Mark,False,12,"Alan I'm sorry, but he's not a criminal, he's just an idiot."
827,827,3,Mark,False,10,"No, stop! Alan I'll pay, I'll pay up for him."
828,828,3,Mark,False,10,Bloody hell Jeremy! You can pay me back in installments.
829,829,3,Mark,False,20,"I don't want a fucking violin, I want to learnt the clarinet and I can't, and I've already got one!"
830,830,3,Mark,False,6,"Our tune, this is our tune."
831,831,3,Mark,True,18,"Yes, I've taken this long enough. We have an arrangement, that's my rallying cry. We have an arrangement."
832,832,3,Mark,False,7,Do you mind if I cut in?
833,833,3,Mark,True,31,"This is it, the worst party ever. My misery has peaked. Oh no look at that, it hadn't peaked. Oh and there's more, good. Yes. Great. This is all just great."
834,834,3,Mark,False,6,"No, I don't really fancy it."
835,835,3,Mark,True,24,"That's right dance, dance the night away, but you'll pay me back Jeremy, even if you end up dancing in cages at fetish bars."
836,836,4,Mark,True,40,"The remains of an old lady's life. What a paltry set of mementos. I don't want to lord it over Jez's dead great-aunt, but I reckon I'd already leave a more interesting set of personal effects. Hope he's coping OK."
837,837,4,Mark,False,6,"Managing to contain your grief, Jeremy?"
838,838,4,Mark,False,4,I think they're trying.
839,839,4,Mark,False,19,"Not a huge reader. Three James Herriots, Frank Muir's autobiography, and the Reader's Digest Quiz And Puzzle Book 1984."
840,840,4,Mark,False,7,Twenty thousand pounds won't last forever Jeremy.
841,841,4,Mark,False,2,A river.
842,842,4,Mark,False,7,I think that's the wrong answer section.
843,843,4,Mark,False,4,So when's the funeral?
844,844,4,Mark,False,2,"Jesus, Jeremy."
845,845,4,Mark,False,7,"You're not serious, it's an illegal firearm."
846,846,4,Mark,False,8,You've got to get rid of it Jeremy.
847,847,4,Mark,False,1,No.
848,848,4,Mark,False,22,"Oh, brilliant. Well as long as no-one can work out the intricate sliding mechanism that opens your drawer, it'll be perfectly safe."
849,849,4,Mark,True,21,"Good old Jeremy's mum. The more sophisticated end of the mum spectrum, the sort of mum you'd buy in John Lewis."
850,850,4,Mark,True,12,Whereas he's the sort of son you'd get free with Nuts magazine.
851,851,4,Mark,False,15,"Sorry, Jez, is there some reason why you're being so incredibly rude to your mum?"
852,852,4,Mark,False,3,Shut up Jeremy.
853,853,4,Mark,False,22,"Oh please, Jez. This level of conflict may be usual for you, but it's not healthy, I'm gonna have a heart attack."
854,854,4,Mark,False,7,We like Taggart. Even the new ones.
855,855,4,Mark,True,7,"OK, so he's ex-Army, but keep calm."
856,856,4,Mark,True,10,"Shit, it's Paddy Ashdown, it's Indiana Jones, it's Indiana Ashdown!"
857,857,4,Mark,False,7,"Pleased to meet you, Martin. I'm Mark."
858,858,4,Mark,False,5,"Er, no, that's the son."
859,859,4,Mark,True,11,"The daughter, I wonder what she's like. Maybe she's the one."
860,860,4,Mark,False,5,Do you need a hand?
861,861,4,Mark,False,9,"Sure, would you like to come in for coffee."
862,862,4,Mark,True,10,"Well if she is the one, she's hiding it brilliantly."
863,863,4,Mark,False,17,"So Martin, Jackie tells me you're a Scots Guards man. Did you see a lot of action?"
864,864,4,Mark,True,16,That was a good question. A much better question than can I get you a coffee?
865,865,4,Mark,False,5,I'll get you a coffee.
866,866,4,Mark,False,2,I try.
867,867,4,Mark,True,10,"Parents do tend to like me. Apart from Dad, obviously."
868,868,4,Mark,False,8,Maybe you should try and talk to him.
869,869,4,Mark,True,9,"The woman has left, let the war talk commence."
870,870,4,Mark,False,27,"So, Martin are you a military history buff or is that too much of a busman's holiday for you? Bit like a butcher looking at... meat catalogues."
871,871,4,Mark,True,8,"Meat catalogues don't exist, Mark, get a grip!"
872,872,4,Mark,False,6,I've got all the Antony Beevors
873,873,4,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, he's rubbish, isn't he?"
874,874,4,Mark,True,4,"I'm so sorry, Antony"
875,875,4,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, that's all I read him for really, the overview. I get the detail elsewhere."
876,876,4,Mark,False,39,"Well, I did once start a business book, and I've always fancied doing an article about the evacuation of Greece in '41 for the local paper. Not that it would really fit in among all the kebab shop stabbings."
877,877,4,Mark,True,25,"Why doesn't Jeremy want you to be his dad? I want you to be my dad, I want to sit on your knee right now."
878,878,4,Mark,True,35,"Right, everyone's out. Might sneak a little peek at the gun. It's fine to be fascinated by the gun. It's fascinating. Everything that can kill a man is fascinating. Guns, electric chairs, paracetamol, lead piping."
879,879,4,Mark,False,16,"Oh, hi Jez. I was just, you know, making sure it was safe. Gunny, the gun."
880,880,4,Mark,False,24,"It's fine to like it as an object, isn't it? I might carry it around the flat for a bit. Would that be OK?"
881,881,4,Mark,True,8,"Oh, this is good, this feels so good."
882,882,4,Mark,False,3,Jackie called earlier.
883,883,4,Mark,False,14,I'm afraid not. She actually invited me to have dinner with her and Martin.
884,884,4,Mark,False,3,Stop it Jeremy.
885,885,4,Mark,True,13,Although what do they want? What will I talk to the grown-ups about?
886,886,4,Mark,False,1,Um.
887,887,4,Mark,True,12,Maybe they're gonna blame me for Jeremy. I should have done more.
888,888,4,Mark,False,7,"Perhaps I won't go, might be awkward."
889,889,4,Mark,False,2,Four thousand.
890,890,4,Mark,False,8,"You're right, Martin. It is a financial minefield."
891,891,4,Mark,True,37,This is great. Why was I anxious? I'm in my element. Older people are still people. They're just people who think when they open a new window on the computer the previous window has disappeared for good.
892,892,4,Mark,False,19,I always think there's probably a third Dimbleby brother who they keep locked away in an attic. Gummo Dimbleby!
893,893,4,Mark,True,19,"Yes! No-one else I know would have found that funny, but I was right to think it was amusing."
894,894,4,Mark,True,2,Fuck you.
895,895,4,Mark,True,9,I would literally stab a baby to do it.
896,896,4,Mark,False,6,"Yes Martin, I think I would."
897,897,4,Mark,False,1,Great.
898,898,4,Mark,False,3,Good for Jeremy?
899,899,4,Mark,False,10,Would it be good for him? What an interesting question.
900,900,4,Mark,True,34,"Which way will Caesar Corrigan's thumb point? This is a fantastic evening. I've become a military historian, and Jeremy's future happiness rests in my hands. And I've got a tiramisu! This is fucking amazing!"
901,901,4,Mark,False,5,"Yes, you've got your money."
902,902,4,Mark,False,4,But there's a condition.
903,903,4,Mark,False,25,"Jackie doesn't trust you with that kind of money, so she wants to put someone in charge of it to control how much you spend."
904,904,4,Mark,False,5,"No, no it's not, actually."
905,905,4,Mark,False,8,It's me. I'm in charge of your money.
906,906,4,Mark,False,3,"No, it isn't."
907,907,4,Mark,True,14,"Yes, it is. I've got your balls in a vice. I'm the iron chancellor!"
908,908,4,Mark,False,29,"Now, I've worked out a budget and I think seventy pounds a week is about right. And I'll take a hundred and thirty pounds for rent and loan repayments."
909,909,4,Mark,False,13,"You don't have to agree, Jeremy. You're free to turn the money down."
910,910,4,Mark,False,3,Do you agree?
911,911,4,Mark,False,32,"To spend on what? You're at your great aunt's wake, Jez. All the food and drink is free and I don't think there's going to be a tombola or a bouncy castle."
912,912,4,Mark,False,16,I've had a few thoughts about the title. Warrior King? Or Master of Men? War Dad?
913,913,4,Mark,True,3,"Fuck, a rival!"
914,914,4,Mark,True,6,A rival who dippy Jackie likes.
915,915,4,Mark,False,1,Right.
916,916,4,Mark,True,7,"OK, need to smarm the sounding board."
917,917,4,Mark,False,4,"Hello, again, is this...?"
918,918,4,Mark,False,2,"Well, hopefully."
919,919,4,Mark,True,35,"Is she straight? Gay? Doesn't bother me, it's just nice to know. It's not like I'm a homophobe, but it's good to know where you are. Stay safe, praise the food, the lukewarm disgusting food."
920,920,4,Mark,False,4,This food is superb.
921,921,4,Mark,False,19,"Actually Natalie, could I interview you about your dad? Bit of prep for the book, if I do it."
922,922,4,Mark,False,5,Just for family colour really.
923,923,4,Mark,True,13,"Like the story of how you did, or possibly didn't, become a lesbian."
924,924,4,Mark,True,2,Case closed.
925,925,4,Mark,False,28,"These are all great stories, Natalie. It'd be good to focus on your dad's career a bit, but these are... class. Let me get us some more wine."
926,926,4,Mark,True,9,Cause you're going through this like a thirsty gay!
927,927,4,Mark,False,13,"You could get a job. People do get jobs, I've got a job."
928,928,4,Mark,False,7,"No, Jeremy, Gunny lives with us now."
929,929,4,Mark,False,22,"Jeremy, the Yardies aren't gonna solve all your problems. Why do you always think that the Yardies are the answer to everything?"
930,930,4,Mark,False,4,What's an Irish wine?
931,931,4,Mark,True,27,"Look at me, talking happily to a lesbian about war and drinking Irish wine. Good job you're dead Norman Mailer, 'cause there's a new gonzo in town."
932,932,4,Mark,True,13,"When did we stop saying ""randy"", I wonder? ""Horny"" has driven ""randy"" out."
933,933,4,Mark,False,1,Jeremy.
934,934,4,Mark,False,18,"Natalie, why don't you take your wine through to my room? We can finish the interview in there."
935,935,4,Mark,False,8,"Look, everything isn't always someone else's fault, Jeremy."
936,936,4,Mark,False,19,"You really do need to get over this whole thing with your mum. You're not Hamlet, stop being Hamlet."
937,937,4,Mark,True,7,He can't think of a Shakespearean character.
938,938,4,Mark,True,8,He couldn't even think of Romeo. Romeo's easy.
939,939,4,Mark,False,13,"Found another bottle. It's Moldovan, but if we Irish it up a bit..."
940,940,4,Mark,True,35,"Right, OK, looks like the floor for me then. Sofa's out, Jeremy's busy murdering pedestrians on Grand Theft Auto. She hasn't had a wee in a while. I hope she doesn't wee in my bed."
941,941,4,Mark,False,5,"Don't wee the bed, Natalie."
942,942,4,Mark,True,14,"That might filter through to her subconscious. I hope the ""don't"" was clear enough."
943,943,4,Mark,True,17,"Mum, I can't find my good pants. I don't want to wear the tight ones, it's P.E."
944,944,4,Mark,False,3,"Natalie, is everything...?"
945,945,4,Mark,True,13,"Oh God, when did she start? This could've been going on all night."
946,946,4,Mark,False,5,"Natalie, sorry, no, I... stop."
947,947,4,Mark,False,12,"Yes, but I don't think we should, I don't really want to-"
948,948,4,Mark,True,13,Maybe this is what they all do in the Army. I'm being initiated.
949,949,4,Mark,False,12,"Yes, OK. I can see that. Point proved. But please stop, Natalie."
950,950,4,Mark,False,13,"I don't- I don't think- could you stop?! Oh, dear God! Oh, dear."
951,951,4,Mark,True,14,"I'm having an orgasm against my will. Oh, God! She's stolen sex off me."
952,952,4,Mark,False,2,"Yes, OK."
953,953,4,Mark,False,1,Right.
954,954,4,Mark,True,10,"At least she didn't wee on me, that's a positive."
955,955,4,Mark,False,2,Bye Natalie.
956,956,4,Mark,False,4,Did you have breakfast?
957,957,4,Mark,False,4,What did you have?
958,958,4,Mark,False,33,"Oh OK, bit funny. I woke up with Natalie shagging me and I wasn't really into it. I asked her to stop, but she didn't. That was a bit of a weird one."
959,959,4,Mark,False,8,Yeah. It was all a bit... you know.
960,960,4,Mark,False,5,"Stop talking like this, Jeremy."
961,961,4,Mark,False,5,It's more complicated than that.
962,962,4,Mark,False,8,"You know I do, don't load the question."
963,963,4,Mark,False,5,How did you get in?
964,964,4,Mark,False,7,"What do you mean, having the gun?"
965,965,4,Mark,False,1,What?
966,966,4,Mark,False,3,"No, no way."
967,967,4,Mark,False,17,"A woman just continued to have sex with me after I'd asked her to stop, that's all."
968,968,4,Mark,False,24,"It wasn't rape, all right? It was just a minor sexual assault. She didn't force anything up my bum. That's why it's not rape."
969,969,4,Mark,False,9,I dunno. He sounded very positive on the phone.
970,970,4,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
971,971,4,Mark,False,15,You're not gonna cause an incident are you Jeremy? This is really important to me.
972,972,4,Mark,True,13,"Please don't shit on my dreams, I don't want shit on my dreams."
973,973,4,Mark,False,13,"Oh, great, I'll start making notes straight away. Thank you so much, Martin."
974,974,4,Mark,True,7,"Look out, Beevor, I'm on your ass!"
975,975,4,Mark,True,34,"Maybe that was actually good sex? Loosen up, Corrigan. This is what happens in the bedroom now. No old-fashioned fumbling and kissing. A lesbian rapes you while you dream about your mother. It's edgy."
976,976,4,Mark,False,23,"Doesn't bother me, Martin. The fruitier the better. War's never a picnic. Although, obviously soldiers do end up eating outdoors quite a lot."
977,977,4,Mark,False,11,Yes. I might just go and have a look round too.
978,978,4,Mark,False,7,What's going on? Why is Gunny here?
979,979,4,Mark,False,11,"Jez, mate, a gun at an airport? No, give me Gunny."
980,980,4,Mark,False,4,"Give me Gunny, Jeremy."
981,981,4,Mark,False,13,"You're aiming the gun at me? Are you going to shoot me, Jeremy?"
982,982,4,Mark,False,13,"I'm so sorry, Martin, really. You don't want the diaries back, do you?"
983,983,4,Mark,False,6,Have a lovely time in Corfu.
984,984,4,Mark,False,2,"Bye, then."
985,985,4,Mark,True,3,"Close, doors, close!"
986,986,4,Mark,False,24,"There was a misunderstanding, that's all, Martin. Crossed wires. It wasn't a proper rape at all. Nothing went up my bum. Off you go."
987,987,4,Mark,False,19,"Well, I did actually say stop. But look, let's just completely forget, forever, what Jeremy just said. You go."
988,988,4,Mark,False,26,"Why am I suddenly the bad guy? He's the one with the gun. She's the one who... not raped me, but... how come I'm the villain?"
989,989,4,Mark,True,19,"No, not the diaries? I've lost the battle of the war diaries. Back to the trenches of credit management."
990,990,5,Mark,True,42,"Jeremy's getting a manager, I'm getting divorced. Maybe he'll end up happy and successful, and I won't. That would be typical. I do everything society demands and die in a ditch. He sits on his arse and accidentally shits a golden egg."
991,991,5,Mark,False,10,"Oh, hi. Yeah, I think there's some in the fridge."
992,992,5,Mark,True,22,"Oh Jesus. I hope I'm not wearing the boxers with the button missing. I don't think so, I think I have coverage."
993,993,5,Mark,False,11,"I like original. Jeremy prefers smooth, but I'm the one buying."
994,994,5,Mark,False,8,"That's right. It isn't as good, is it?"
995,995,5,Mark,True,24,"Is there a button there? Sitting's going to pull the thing wide open if not. Maybe it's sexy, a little glimpse of ball sack."
996,996,5,Mark,False,7,But I thought... aren't you and Jeremy...?
997,997,5,Mark,True,26,"I'll fill you! I love you Cally, you are the one! Let's get married by Sir Alan Sugar and live off all-butter croissants in Canary Wharf!"
998,998,5,Mark,False,6,"Hello, hello. Room for one more?"
999,999,5,Mark,False,16,"Managed to get a couple days off around the weekend, so I thought I'd tag along."
1000,1000,5,Mark,False,20,"But I bought a tour jacket especially. It's leather, but it has lapels so I can wear it to work."
1001,1001,5,Mark,False,4,You are being rude.
1002,1002,5,Mark,False,27,"No, not at all. I've always been a big supporter of you and your music. Please Jez, I'm getting divorced. I need something to pep me up."
1003,1003,5,Mark,False,9,"Exactly. Drugs, birds, and physical labour. Them's me specialities!"
1004,1004,5,Mark,True,24,"Look at her go. Two phones, spare battery for her Blackberry. No ""I'm out of juice"" bullshit from her. She is so the one."
1005,1005,5,Mark,False,7,Well from a business point of view...
1006,1006,5,Mark,False,7,I think you made the right decision.
1007,1007,5,Mark,False,12,"Jeremy, we agreed not to do the funny voices after ""that week""."
1008,1008,5,Mark,False,5,She's not really a groupie.
1009,1009,5,Mark,False,29,"It's great they're doing this. You know, the download market alone for Christian rock is estimated at forty million plus. I've actually put together a bit of research on-"
1010,1010,5,Mark,False,2,Thank you.
1011,1011,5,Mark,False,33,"Well, actually one thing did occur. Not wanting to be horrible to Jeremy but Super Hans did seem more like the kind of person you'd expect to see in a band like this."
1012,1012,5,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
1013,1013,5,Mark,False,8,"Oh no, I didn't mean... I just meant..."
1014,1014,5,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
1015,1015,5,Mark,False,9,"Look, Cally. No, we don't have a shared dick."
1016,1016,5,Mark,False,4,How do you mean?
1017,1017,5,Mark,False,9,"I have been out with women, so I guess..."
1018,1018,5,Mark,False,2,"OK, sure."
1019,1019,5,Mark,True,34,"Wow, I've got a date. I'm a real piece of shit. I bet those two things go hand in hand. Bet if I got into defrauding pensioners the pussy would really start rolling in."
1020,1020,5,Mark,False,5,"It's fine, it was fun."
1021,1021,5,Mark,False,15,"Come on guys, where are all the Chinese peasants? Where are the German toilet cleaners?"
1022,1022,5,Mark,True,20,"God, I can't believe I'm dating someone I really like. I've done it right. I've done it right for once."
1023,1023,5,Mark,False,2,Oh God!
1024,1024,5,Mark,True,2,She's funny.
1025,1025,5,Mark,True,4,Is she still joking?
1026,1026,5,Mark,False,4,"Oh right, fascinating... theory."
1027,1027,5,Mark,False,5,In a factory? From glass?
1028,1028,5,Mark,False,1,No.
1029,1029,5,Mark,False,1,Yes.
1030,1030,5,Mark,True,7,Please don't make me believe in them.
1031,1031,5,Mark,False,6,I do believe in crystal skulls.
1032,1032,5,Mark,False,19,I believe that they were crafted by the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis and that they're powerful centres of healing.
1033,1033,5,Mark,True,6,Sorry science. Sorry enlightenment. Sorry logic.
1034,1034,5,Mark,True,26,Well that was great. Apart from the crystal skull sending out it's invisible rays of bullshit. I think that might be my best ever sexual experience.
1035,1035,5,Mark,False,4,"I'm sorry, the whole..."
1036,1036,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
1037,1037,5,Mark,False,11,Well I suppose in general- what exactly did I do wrong?
1038,1038,5,Mark,False,6,You stopped Jeremy in the middle?
1039,1039,5,Mark,False,4,"I do, a bit."
1040,1040,5,Mark,False,6,Oh well that's good to know.
1041,1041,5,Mark,False,6,That could be a good system.
1042,1042,5,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1043,1043,5,Mark,False,3,Not a problem.
1044,1044,5,Mark,True,29,Is this humiliating? It is a bit humiliating. I guess the upside is that what I was doing before was humiliating in a way I wasn't even aware of.
1045,1045,5,Mark,True,38,"Oh my God, this is brilliant. I'm a sex robot servicing the one. I always wondered what my fetish was and it seems what truly turns me on is being basically absent for most of the sex act."
1046,1046,5,Mark,True,21,"Look at them all, the Christians. It's not fair, I could be that happy if I believed a lot of rubbish."
1047,1047,5,Mark,False,2,What idea?
1048,1048,5,Mark,False,19,That wasn't... my idea was more throw a bit more light on Hans and maybe give Jez a tambourine.
1049,1049,5,Mark,False,8,I really don't think that's a fair analogy.
1050,1050,5,Mark,True,18,Is that Jeremy? Is he getting baptised? I can't let him out of my sight for a minute.
1051,1051,5,Mark,False,15,"What? Oh, no, no, it's not my job. You're the manager. I'm just the roadie."
1052,1052,5,Mark,True,10,Oh God I'm the messenger. Somebody please shoot the messenger.
1053,1053,5,Mark,False,2,"Yes, right."
1054,1054,5,Mark,True,23,"Just walk him into the car park and shoot him in the back of the head. I'm Tony Soprano, he's an FBI stripper."
1055,1055,5,Mark,True,25,"Oh God, he's on a raft floating towards Niagra Falls flicking through Heat magazine with one hand down his trousers. I've got to tell him."
1056,1056,5,Mark,False,27,"Look Jez. There's something I need to tell you. It's not good news. Cally told me, she and Super Hans, they want... you're out of the band."
1057,1057,5,Mark,True,11,Might slip this one under the rug while he's still reeling.
1058,1058,5,Mark,False,23,"Yeah, because we're going out and she told me she's had this idea. And I said ""no, don't"". That's literally what I said."
1059,1059,5,Mark,True,8,Seemed to get away from the Cally thing.
1060,1060,5,Mark,False,3,What? No Jez.
1061,1061,5,Mark,False,31,"It is not a no-brainer. I'll have to think about it. It's a brainer. It's a real brainer. See the thing is, I don't think I've ever done sex right before."
1062,1062,5,Mark,False,17,Cally's teaching me. She gives me second-by-second detailed instructions of what to put where for how long.
1063,1063,5,Mark,False,80,"Look, if I break up with her, I don't see myself having good sex ever again. Unless I'm like, going on holiday to Hawaii and the plane crashes, and all my fellow survivors are women sex therapists on their way to a conference. And even then, they'll probably be loads of male sex therapists there too and they'd love that, wouldn't they? All fucking each other and giving each other tips while I sit on a rock wanking and crying."
1064,1064,5,Mark,False,8,"No. God no. Don't worry, nothing like that."
1065,1065,5,Mark,True,18,"She stopped him in the middle. I'll save that for a rainy day, that's money in the bank."
1066,1066,5,Mark,False,24,"Maybe it's for the best though, Jez. Maybe solo, you can do all the things you've always wanted. That rap thing with Howard Marks."
1067,1067,5,Mark,False,22,"OK, sure. Just remind me again why you are so brilliant? I mean I know why, but it's good to have soundbites."
1068,1068,5,Mark,False,5,"No Jeremy, you can't just..."
1069,1069,5,Mark,True,11,Shit. He's entering the chamber. The sacred chamber of satisfactory sex.
1070,1070,5,Mark,False,13,"Jeremy, let's just go. Or you can leave her a very frank note."
1071,1071,5,Mark,False,2,No Jez.
1072,1072,5,Mark,False,2,"Jez, no."
1073,1073,5,Mark,True,29,"I could make the best of it, go for a freebie on the skull. He'll get the blame, I'll bank mate points. I'm golden. Haha, unlucky pal. I win."
1074,1074,5,Mark,False,2,"Ow, fuck!"
1075,1075,5,Mark,True,4,The revenge of Atlantis.
1076,1076,5,Mark,False,24,"Jez, how long are you going to keep going with the orgy of destruction? Because I'd rather not be here when she turns up."
1077,1077,5,Mark,True,18,"Hope she's not too upset. Fuck it, if it's healing powers are so legendary, it can fix itself."
1078,1078,5,Mark,True,44,"Ah, there she is. Leaving with the one. Not a bad weekend, all told. Got myself a girlfriend, had the best sex of my life. Did my bit to delay the dawning of the Age of Aquarius with my trusty friend the house brick."
1079,1079,5,Mark,True,35,"She's giving me the finger. The one is giving me the finger. Ah yes, that's more like it. The one is gone. The familiar gut punch of pain and confusion is back. Hello old friend."
1080,1080,6,Mark,True,41,"What an amazing day. Promotion. Finally, all the backbiting and plotting and arse-kissing and credit-stealing and hard work has paid off. Goodbye, Mark Corrigan, credit manager. Hello, Mark Corrigan, senior credit manager. I've smashed the glass ceiling with my greasy pole!"
1081,1081,6,Mark,False,1,Sophie?
1082,1082,6,Mark,True,14,What's she doing here? Broken glass in my muesli? Pesto in the hard drive?
1083,1083,6,Mark,False,3,Are you OK?
1084,1084,6,Mark,False,5,"Well, thanks. See you soon."
1085,1085,6,Mark,True,23,"Is that it? No sarcastic put down, no casual kick in the balls? Maybe it's because she's been smoking drugs. Good old drugs."
1086,1086,6,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Jez."
1087,1087,6,Mark,False,29,"I think this might be the best day of my life. War with Sophie is over, and Johnson's given me a promotion. I've only got own bloody little office."
1088,1088,6,Mark,True,11,"Ouch, the ghost at the feast. Better take the mustard off."
1089,1089,6,Mark,False,17,"I mean, it wasn't that great. Lunch was pretty nothing-y. Baked potato, again. Are you all right?"
1090,1090,6,Mark,True,2,Oh shit.
1091,1091,6,Mark,False,6,"Oh, what? No. No, no, no."
1092,1092,6,Mark,False,13,"Jez, you're not a talentless, misguided dickhead. That's the last thing you are."
1093,1093,6,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Dobs."
1094,1094,6,Mark,False,9,What was that screen that you just closed down?
1095,1095,6,Mark,False,4,Was it Fantasy Warquest?
1096,1096,6,Mark,False,12,"Well, I used to have a Paladin, Vardor, in Dungeons and Dragons."
1097,1097,6,Mark,False,1,Fourteen.
1098,1098,6,Mark,False,12,"But I've never done Warquest, although obviously I've read loads about it."
1099,1099,6,Mark,False,6,I know. Why are we whispering?
1100,1100,6,Mark,True,5,"Oh, what does he want?"
1101,1101,6,Mark,False,1,Hello?
1102,1102,6,Mark,False,7,"Yes, that's right. Are you OK, Jez?"
1103,1103,6,Mark,False,7,"OK, agreed. Are you sure you're OK?"
1104,1104,6,Mark,True,11,Weird. Maybe he's on acid or watched a whole Jeremy Kyle.
1105,1105,6,Mark,False,2,Sounds interesting.
1106,1106,6,Mark,True,3,"God, she's dangerous."
1107,1107,6,Mark,False,6,"I shall expect no quarter, Gwynlath."
1108,1108,6,Mark,True,53,"She's my dream, my nightmare. Oh, I'm excited. And guilty. Oh, Sophie. Why do I feel guilty? I haven't done anything wrong. I feel guilty about everything from the pollution caused by Chinese industrialisation to not wearing some pairs of boxers as much as others. I'm sorry, stripy blue, you're just too tight."
1109,1109,6,Mark,False,1,Agreed.
1110,1110,6,Mark,False,22,"Well, I'm up for it if Dobby's up for it. But Gerrard, don't call me boss outside work. I don't like it."
1111,1111,6,Mark,True,6,I very much do like it.
1112,1112,6,Mark,True,26,"Dobby, the acceptable face of woman. I hardly have to modify my behaviour at all in her company. I really think she might be the one."
1113,1113,6,Mark,False,5,You've cleaned the... the what?
1114,1114,6,Mark,False,11,Back in a minute. Feel free to use my enchanted coracle.
1115,1115,6,Mark,False,9,What course? Are you OK? Is everything all right?
1116,1116,6,Mark,False,21,"The New Wellness Centre? Oh Jez, I think I've heard about these people. There's stuff all over the internet about them."
1117,1117,6,Mark,False,10,There's a lot of stuff about an asteroid in here.
1118,1118,6,Mark,False,1,Orgones?
1119,1119,6,Mark,False,4,And you believe that?
1120,1120,6,Mark,False,14,"I mean, I couldn't just... there are so many historical and economic factors that-"
1121,1121,6,Mark,False,24,"But come on, Jez. Asteroids? Orgones? I mean, what would you say if I came home one day talking about that kind of stuff?"
1122,1122,6,Mark,True,16,Jeremy's in a cult. Jeremy in a cult. It does have a certain ring to it.
1123,1123,6,Mark,False,3,So Sue's off.
1124,1124,6,Mark,False,5,"She's taking it well, though."
1125,1125,6,Mark,True,10,"He's not gonna hump me in my office, is he?"
1126,1126,6,Mark,False,3,"Sure thing, Alan."
1127,1127,6,Mark,True,20,"Oh God, firing people. Maybe he's gonna make me fire Dobby. He knows I like her. He's scented my weakness."
1128,1128,6,Mark,False,5,"Hi, Soph, how you doing?"
1129,1129,6,Mark,False,4,"Yup, it's very horrible."
1130,1130,6,Mark,False,11,"He's joined a cult, and he's changing his name, but fine."
1131,1131,6,Mark,False,1,Jared.
1132,1132,6,Mark,False,2,I know.
1133,1133,6,Mark,True,5,"Quick divorce, back for nibbles."
1134,1134,6,Mark,False,9,"So how are things? What happened to what's-his-name, Tolly?"
1135,1135,6,Mark,False,12,"Right. Men don't like babies as much as women, that's my analysis."
1136,1136,6,Mark,False,23,"You know, I've got someone in the crosshairs, but I might let her live a bit longer before I pull the trigger there."
1137,1137,6,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, well, I probably do miss you. A bit."
1138,1138,6,Mark,True,6,She's playing me like a tuba.
1139,1139,6,Mark,True,31,"Should I? I could. I haven't made my move on the Dobster. I'm still a free man. Maybe I'm Shaft. Maybe I'm Trump. Yeah, I'm Trump in my dirty, wiggy tower."
1140,1140,6,Mark,True,26,"Look at me, drunken one night stand. I mean, she is my wife. Still, finally got to use my bachelor's emergency condom. Oh, shit. Oh, bollocks!"
1141,1141,6,Mark,False,36,"Soph, I think there might be a bit of a problem. It's not- it's been in my wallet so long, I think the rubber may have perished. Old Meg has broken. Oh God, Soph, I'm sorry."
1142,1142,6,Mark,False,14,"I suppose, just to be on the safe side, the morning-after pill, you could-"
1143,1143,6,Mark,False,1,What?
1144,1144,6,Mark,False,7,"Soph, why are you sitting like that?"
1145,1145,6,Mark,False,2,Like that.
1146,1146,6,Mark,False,7,"It's just, sitting like that, it might-"
1147,1147,6,Mark,False,4,Stop sitting like that.
1148,1148,6,Mark,False,3,Please sit up.
1149,1149,6,Mark,True,28,"That is low. That is really low. She's taken my sperm, and sperm is like lending someone less than a fiver. You can't really ask for it back."
1150,1150,6,Mark,True,25,Hope she's not pregnant. It's been ages. She hasn't mentioned it. She won't be pregnant. It's not like I'm a Royal Marine with super sperm.
1151,1151,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, hi, Alan."
1152,1152,6,Mark,False,7,Sophie? You want me to fire Sophie?
1153,1153,6,Mark,True,3,She's so un-pregnated.
1154,1154,6,Mark,False,4,"Yes, take a seat."
1155,1155,6,Mark,True,6,"Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck."
1156,1156,6,Mark,False,17,"Er, yes, there's... there's something I want... well, I don't want... but I've got to... tell you."
1157,1157,6,Mark,False,2,Oh yes?
1158,1158,6,Mark,True,10,"Please don't say you're pregnant, please don't say you're pregnant."
1159,1159,6,Mark,True,1,Fuuuuuuuuuuuck!
1160,1160,6,Mark,False,5,"Right, you're pregnant. Of course."
1161,1161,6,Mark,False,3,"Right, only three?"
1162,1162,6,Mark,False,10,"Well, have you ever considered, you know, redundancy? Voluntary redundancy?"
1163,1163,6,Mark,False,6,Have you ever considered involuntary redundancy?
1164,1164,6,Mark,False,14,"No, I mean, I've been asked to fire you, but that doesn't necessarily mean-"
1165,1165,6,Mark,True,27,"Oh, fiddlesticks. Of course, I'm having a baby. Great, I'll probably drop it. Or it'll grow up and write a bitter memoir about how distant I was."
1166,1166,6,Mark,False,22,"Look, Sophie, I'm not gonna fire you. We'll sort something out. I'll fire someone else. Paul, he's a pain in the arse."
1167,1167,6,Mark,True,3,Please stop crying.
1168,1168,6,Mark,False,29,"And I- I just want to say that, that I'll be there for you. I'm gonna look after you, and I'll cook your meals, and wash your clothes, and..."
1169,1169,6,Mark,True,2,Still crying.
1170,1170,6,Mark,False,10,"If you want, I'll be there for you twenty-four seven."
1171,1171,6,Mark,False,1,Absolutely.
1172,1172,6,Mark,True,14,Just got to say the right words. Can think about what they mean later.
1173,1173,6,Mark,True,35,What the fuck am I doing? I'm in a wood in Kent with a plastic sword. I've crossed a line. I'm an executive and a father to be. This isn't me. These aren't my people.
1174,1174,6,Mark,True,4,She's the one. Definitely.
1175,1175,6,Mark,False,18,"I think I'll jump in the van. Need to get home, and Sophie asked me to come over."
1176,1176,6,Mark,True,27,"There she goes. Goodbye, Dobby. Because I'm having a baby with a woman who probably secretly hates me. Don't want to mess up that sweet little deal."
1177,1177,6,Mark,False,11,"Actually, Gerrard, there's been something I've been meaning to mention too."
1178,1178,6,Mark,False,2,You're fired.
1179,1179,6,Mark,False,7,"From JLB, you're fired from your job."
1180,1180,6,Mark,False,8,Absolutely not. You're just not pulling your weight.
1181,1181,6,Mark,False,5,That is simply not true.
1182,1182,6,Mark,False,29,"OK, well, maybe I have been a bit hasty. Your work is showing signs of improvement in some areas. So, very well, after this talk you're not fired. Satisfied?"
1183,1183,6,Mark,True,13,"Oh my God, I can't fire anyone. I'm like British Leyland in 1976."
1184,1184,6,Mark,True,17,"New TV, and it's HD ready. I am so ready for HD. HD will make everything better."
1185,1185,6,Mark,False,3,What is it?
1186,1186,6,Mark,False,17,"Oh, yeah. Sure, I'll hang on to that. So... is he really actually going to the centre?"
1187,1187,6,Mark,True,28,"She's nice. Maybe it'll be OK with me and Soph. Quick game of Warquest. When you have a baby, probably any relationship issues you have just melt away."
1188,1188,6,Mark,False,3,"Yeah, see ya."
1189,1189,6,Mark,False,16,Yeah. The Dobby door's definitely closed. I waited too long. Her and Gerrard are an item.
1190,1190,6,Mark,False,24,"I don't think you should go. You do know that, don't you? I'll come and get you if you like. I'll happily deprogram you."
1191,1191,6,Mark,False,10,"No, Jez, me and Sophie might be having a baby."
1192,1192,6,Mark,False,13,Oh my God! I knew it! Everyone is secretly fucking behind my back!
1193,1193,6,Mark,False,16,"Oh, right, brilliant. Well, I won't throw away my ticket in the baby raffle just yet!"
1194,1194,6,Mark,False,47,"You had sex with my wife, Jeremy! That's quite a number, even for you! But then, on the other hand, I was definitely having a baby, which to be honest wasn't really on my to-do list for the year. So, in a way, things are looking up."
1195,1195,6,Mark,False,25,"It's called guilt, Jeremy. Most people feel it quite a bit when they've done something wrong. This is why you've become a cult-head, isn't it?"
1196,1196,6,Mark,True,4,"Do the maths, Jeremy."
1197,1197,6,Mark,False,21,"He's not moving into the compound. We don't need any of your Orgones here, Super Hans. He's staying where he belongs."
1198,1198,6,Mark,False,19,Just because he's a dickhead doesn't mean I'm not his friend. I'm a better friend than you've ever been.
1199,1199,6,Mark,False,11,"Look, dickhead or not, he belongs here in the real world."
1200,1200,6,Mark,False,10,"Well, it's better than asteroids and tablets and Orgones. Whoops."
1201,1201,6,Mark,False,2,"No, stop!"
1202,1202,6,Mark,False,8,"Yeah, but it's HD ready. It's HD ready!"
1203,1203,6,Mark,False,10,"Don't worry. Home insurance, my friend. Finally, it's payback time."
1204,1204,6,Mark,False,11,"Yeah. We'll get a new telly, even bigger than this one."
1205,1205,6,Mark,False,31,"Well, if Sophie continues down her path toward self destruction, we'll end up adopting like a couple of gay dads anyway, so we'll never need to find out whose it is."
1206,1206,6,Mark,False,1,Exactly.
1207,1207,6,Mark,True,2,"Oh, Jesus."
