0,0,1,Jeremy,True,21,"OK Jez, the love of your life's coming back today, finish this shitty relationship. Shot to the head, nice clean kill."
1,1,1,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
2,2,1,Jeremy,True,18,"She might go angry, and I don't like her when she's angry. Just got to tough it out."
3,3,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Um, listen, Michelle, about us."
4,4,1,Jeremy,False,27,"Oh, right. That's interesting, because I was thinking that I like you loads and loads, obviously, but that also we could not see each other any more."
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,22,"Well, I mean instead of us calling each other up and kind of meeting up and hanging out, we could try... not."
6,6,1,Jeremy,False,1,You.
7,7,1,Jeremy,True,3,"Nothing, it's just-"
8,8,1,Jeremy,False,22,"Right, no, kind of what I was saying was that we should split up and not see each other any more because-"
9,9,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Well, yeah."
10,10,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah. I mean, what would that involve exactly?"
11,11,1,Jeremy,False,18,I guess I've always wondered what it might be like to have a threesome. Is that too much?
12,12,1,Jeremy,True,28,"This'll be OK, I'll just do the threesome tomorrow, then finish with her. Bit ungentlemanly but then, it's a threesome, it's not exactly Romeo and Juliet is it?"
13,13,1,Jeremy,False,5,Hey Mark. You all right?
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,10,...cool mate? If I have a bit of your parsley?
15,15,1,Jeremy,False,6,It's just a bit of parsley!
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh man, that is unlucky."
17,17,1,Jeremy,True,10,"Of course, they target the frail, they smell the weak."
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,8,"So, what happened, did they pull a knife?"
19,19,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Jesus, a shooter?"
20,20,1,Jeremy,False,1,No?
21,21,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Uh-huh. So, they asked, and you just gave them your wallet?"
22,22,1,Jeremy,False,27,"Gentlemen who asked for your possessions. Mark, you've gotta toughen up. This is the twenty-first century. You've seen Mad Max haven't you? That's what's going to happen."
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,25,"Oh sure mate, you live in your Hitchhikers' Guide world where you wander round in your dressing gown and have a nice cup of tea."
24,24,1,Jeremy,False,18,"Right, it's just, I was hoping, you know, it's my big meal, the big night with big Suze."
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, kind of. I mean no. She offered me a threesome."
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,28,"Oh I am, Mark, totally. She called again tonight. God, what a great call. You know, it was like the old days, she was laughing like a... maniac!"
27,27,1,Jeremy,False,23,Oh well I had a bit of a plan about that. I thought I wouldn't tell big Suze about Michelle or the threesome.
28,28,1,Jeremy,False,4,"It's good, isn't it?"
29,29,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Well that's just as well then isn't it, because now she's coming back. So shut up."
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,1,Mark.
31,31,1,Jeremy,False,2,Hey Soph.
32,32,1,Jeremy,False,5,Where's all the Ikea candles?
33,33,1,Jeremy,False,6,"It's Suze, big Suze is here!"
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Big Suze, my God you're looking great. Three years, yeah? Three bloody years!"
35,35,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Right, what a weird coincidence."
36,36,1,Jeremy,False,5,Stu? What's Stu? Who's Stu?
37,37,1,Jeremy,False,8,What the hell do you mean by that?
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,27,"But, your man? Because I thought, you know, we- on the phone, there was all the laughing, I mean, I thought... what was all the laughing for?"
39,39,1,Jeremy,False,2,Oh right.
40,40,1,Jeremy,True,8,"Shit, they're still in contact. Think of something."
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,3,No I'm not.
42,42,1,Jeremy,False,36,"No that was just a mistake followed by a series of subsequent mistakes which when you look at all together really don't add up to much. Anyway I've done all that now,so there's nothing stopping us..."
43,43,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, should we though?"
44,44,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Hi, I'm her ex."
45,45,1,Jeremy,False,9,We lived together for a year and a half.
46,46,1,Jeremy,False,3,The love shack?!
47,47,1,Jeremy,False,1,No.
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,6,There isn't that much hot water.
49,49,1,Jeremy,True,20,"He's a monk, he's gonna have fifteen years of spunk backed up. How am I supposed to compete with that?"
50,50,1,Jeremy,True,43,"God, how long does a shower take? Still, drinking alone, what's the big deal? Why is it necessarily a bad thing? If you drink a bottle of vodka and there's a bloke sitting next to you, does that somehow make it all right?"
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,1,Whatever.
52,52,1,Jeremy,True,32,"Jesus, that's what a man should look like. Those arms, they're amazing. Like boughs of sturdy English oak. My God, if you had them wrapped around you, you'd just feel so safe."
53,53,1,Jeremy,False,1,Sure.
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Ah ha ha, how do you like that, Stu? You... monk."
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,21,"You know what it means Stu, from how it makes you feel, that's what it means, yeah. Welcome to big school."
56,56,1,Jeremy,True,16,"Threesome, oh yeah, here I come. No need for big Suze ever even to know about..."
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,2,Big Suze!
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Well, yeah."
59,59,1,Jeremy,True,21,"Oh my God, I'm gonna have a threesome with big Suze. Michelle's not some sort of macho sexual terrorist, she's brilliant!"
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,1,Hi.
61,61,1,Jeremy,False,6,"So, Suze, brilliant to see you."
62,62,1,Jeremy,False,5,You're moving in with Michelle?
63,63,1,Jeremy,False,2,I know.
64,64,1,Jeremy,False,2,Where's she-?
65,65,1,Jeremy,False,2,Hi there.
66,66,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?
67,67,1,Jeremy,False,6,Why isn't she talking to me?
68,68,1,Jeremy,True,12,"I will have had a threesome, I will have had a threesome."
69,69,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Yeah, right. Suze, you don't wanna go back out with me, do you?"
70,70,1,Jeremy,True,31,"This is great, I'm having it large. It's like I'm living in a porno. Except, porn stars probably get lovely sedatives so they feel like they're not really there. Lovely sedatives."
71,71,1,Jeremy,True,54,"That wasn't depressing, that was great. Big Suze out of my life forever, so what? I'm getting threesomes. Why have I never thought about drinking in the day before? What's more fun than a couple of nice cold beerskis? What's depressing about that? Nothing. You can't be depressed when you're pissed, it's not possible."
72,72,1,Jeremy,False,3,I'm on it.
73,73,1,Jeremy,False,4,I'm at the supermarket.
74,74,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Yep, I'm doing the big shop and I'm doing it brilliantly."
75,75,1,Jeremy,False,5,No. I also have dips.
76,76,1,Jeremy,True,6,I'll say I ate the dips.
77,77,1,Jeremy,False,24,"Of course not. Shut up, don't knock the drinking. It was while I was drinking that I came up with my plan about Stu."
78,78,1,Jeremy,False,4,I'm gonna hit him.
79,79,1,Jeremy,False,28,"Of course it's a plan, it's a fucking brilliant plan. I plan to hit him. What isn't a plan about that? Look, I'll see you in a bit."
80,80,1,Jeremy,True,30,"God I must look so cool to her. Like Pete Doherty or Bukowski. Yeah, that's right honey, I'm a street-fighting man. God, she's probably getting wet just looking at me."
81,81,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Hold your horses, honey. I've got coupons for the Pringles."
82,82,1,Jeremy,False,8,Yes and I think he'll definitely be calling!
83,83,1,Jeremy,True,37,"Yeah, come on Stu, you stupid monk. Come on buddy, I watched you go in. You've gotta come out. They don't have beds in churches. I don't think, do they? Maybe they do, for the vicars and..."
84,84,1,Jeremy,False,3,Yeah I'm fine.
85,85,1,Jeremy,True,8,Probably missed the moment to smack him now.
86,86,1,Jeremy,False,3,How are you?
87,87,1,Jeremy,False,6,Yeah that might be nice actually.
88,88,1,Jeremy,True,19,"Oh, the hug, I'm finally getting the hug. He smells good. Those big arms. I just feel so safe."
89,89,1,Jeremy,True,11,"I like it here, feels calm, almost spiritual. I feel different."
90,90,1,Jeremy,False,5,This is a good song.
91,91,1,Jeremy,True,44,"Oh she's beautiful, like an angel. Oh right, I get it, it's all a big love club down the church, except I'm not invited. The only clubs I'm invited to are horrible sex parties and friends reunited dos at TGI Fridays. Well, fuck you!"
92,92,1,Jeremy,False,17,"That's right Stu, God didn't protect you from my big fist. Yeah, you big lump of monk."
93,93,1,Jeremy,True,12,"Good old Michelle, cold but comforting. Kind of like a friendly Dalek."
94,94,1,Jeremy,False,20,"I think that guy's got a problem. He's like some kind of David Koresh, Archbishop Tutu-style religious maniac, you know?"
95,95,1,Jeremy,False,5,"But, we've already done that."
96,96,1,Jeremy,True,3,"Oh God, no."
97,97,1,Jeremy,False,14,"I mean, I don't feel very well. Can't we do it some other time?"
98,98,1,Jeremy,False,10,But I really... I really don't think I want to.
99,99,1,Jeremy,True,38,"It was a sort of deal I suppose. Don't want to get a reputation as a deal-welcher. Might stop me getting a mortgage. Maybe it'll be better if I imagine it's Stu. Yeah, just imagine it's lovely Stu."
100,100,2,Jeremy,False,15,She's not a rich- Merry's a very good friend of mine and Mark's from uni.
101,101,2,Jeremy,False,2,Super Hans!
102,102,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Really, 'cause it looks like it's not-"
103,103,2,Jeremy,True,35,Canadian Merry. She probably thinks I'm getting nowhere with my music and that's why I'm doing removals. I'll tell her all the cool bands do removals. I'll say Franz Ferdinand have got their own van.
104,104,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Yeah, I guess it does. Not too sad though? What with your mum dying and everything?"
105,105,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, that's a good attitude, probably."
106,106,2,Jeremy,False,6,That's yours? You own the pub?
107,107,2,Jeremy,False,34,"What, us run a pub? Well, I've- I've never really thought about it before, but now that I do, I think I'd probably like to do that more than anything else in the world."
108,108,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Does it? Are you sure? 'Cause I really don't think it does, if it's a pub."
109,109,2,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
110,110,2,Jeremy,False,41,"Well, it was, and it will be again. Just imagine, me in the pub all day, but no one can say anything 'cause it's my job, so I've got to be there. I'll literally get paid to go to the pub."
111,111,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Mark, do you have to live quite so relentlessly in the real world?"
112,112,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Market research? If you build it, they will come! That's my market research."
113,113,2,Jeremy,False,25,"Yeah, well, you're barred 'cause I can do that. I have the power to bar, and I won't necessarily be using it wisely or compassionately."
114,114,2,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah, I know. Still, we can move all this crap out and put a bar in, what, over there?"
115,115,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Perfect? Super Hans, it doesn't even look like a pub."
116,116,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Yeah, well, I'm sure we can sort that out somehow. Let's start by getting rid of this."
117,117,2,Jeremy,False,8,You want a washing machine in the pub?
118,118,2,Jeremy,False,29,"Right. The thing is Hans, as I've said before, I really just think we should serve at least one lager and nuts, you know? People like lager and nuts."
119,119,2,Jeremy,False,1,But-
120,120,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. People always do."
121,121,2,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh, that's Merry. God, she's such a laugh. Didn't you two even have a thing back in Darty?"
122,122,2,Jeremy,False,26,"But I thought- didn't you stay over in her room the night we did all the blues? Blues Brothers, Betty Blue, Blue Velvet, The Big Blue?"
123,123,2,Jeremy,False,28,"But I thought- I definitely remember you writing that very long letter in marker pen and then having a freak-out and burning it. That was you, wasn't it?"
124,124,2,Jeremy,False,27,"No problem there. I mean, we're deadlocked on that and a few other things, but, you know, I'm definitely not co-managing a pub called ""Free the Paedos""."
125,125,2,Jeremy,False,10,"OK, party time for the El Dude Brothers! Ah, ah!"
126,126,2,Jeremy,False,1,Ah!
127,127,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Right. Merry, where is everyone?"
128,128,2,Jeremy,True,8,"Oh shit, here it comes. The dream dies."
129,129,2,Jeremy,False,20,"Oh, right. I just thought maybe if we could manage it for a little while, then you could see if-"
130,130,2,Jeremy,False,1,What?
131,131,2,Jeremy,False,5,"You mean, like, own it?"
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, OK, sure!"
133,133,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, my God! Hey, fuck you, Mark! The world's not all wrong sometimes! I'm calling Super Hans."
134,134,2,Jeremy,False,39,"Yeah, totally. But Hans, I really think all of our major differences will just kind of drift away as long as we don't try and confront them too early, yeah? OK, right, yeah, I'll see you down there, yeah."
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,7,"You've got such low self-esteem, haven't you?"
136,136,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, rubbish. She's always been a bit full-on. She's kooky!"
137,137,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, right, now I get it. She has some faith in Jeremy, hence she must be mental."
138,138,2,Jeremy,False,9,"OK, maybe she is a bit up and down."
139,139,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Hi, Mark, it's Jeremy. I'm with Merry, she was outside."
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Merry's come for her instructions, about the curly whirly cuckoo?"
141,141,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Merry, that's just three numbers."
142,142,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, let's call you a cab."
143,143,2,Jeremy,False,8,"I don't know, I'm scared. This isn't usual."
144,144,2,Jeremy,False,10,"What are we gonna do, Mark? She's gone literally bonkers."
145,145,2,Jeremy,False,8,Who's got more responsibility for her than us.
146,146,2,Jeremy,False,1,Pej?
147,147,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Shit, I just don't know. We could try the number."
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,10,It's worth a try. It's not gonna work. Doesn't work.
149,149,2,Jeremy,True,51,"If it turns out to be easy, I could get a few other troublesome people sectioned. Get Mark sectioned, get his nice, big room. Guess it might cause a bit of a bump in the friendship, but I mean, we got over the coffee rings on the dining table incident, eventually."
150,150,2,Jeremy,False,1,Cool.
151,151,2,Jeremy,True,18,"So Merry's gone. If I got sectioned, I'd put up more of a fight. Downside: might get lobotomised"
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,2,Still nothing?
153,153,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Right, a talking point."
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,11,"What, me? No! Why, did you try and get him sectioned?"
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Well, I definitely didn't try to get you sectioned."
156,156,2,Jeremy,True,4,That sounded pretty convincing.
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,21,"I guess it was just one of those freaky urban things, like those people who go on fire for no reason."
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, right, arsehole."
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,43,"Well, maybe, but we need to agree on some stuff, like, and don't fly off the handle, but I'm just really not happy with the name ""Free the Paedos"". I mean, can't we call it something more normal, like ""The Swan and... Tomato""?"
160,160,2,Jeremy,False,8,Yeah. OK. sure. And what about lager and-
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Ah, could be a problem there. Merry, see, Merry's been sectioned."
162,162,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Well, I have to say she's looking a lot better."
163,163,2,Jeremy,False,22,"But she's fine! She's always been the life and soul! Tabasco in your pint, Frisbee in the kitchen, that's Merry. She's kooky."
164,164,2,Jeremy,False,5,"What do you think, Merry?"
165,165,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Come on, mate, let her go, it's for the best."
166,166,2,Jeremy,False,30,"Oh right, I see. Your little world is threatened by all the amazing Jack Nicholsons and Robin Williamses burning so bright you've gotta keep them down with your chemical cosh."
167,167,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Your dream is just everyone on the omnibus, grey, eating grey sludge. That's your dream, isn't it?"
168,168,2,Jeremy,False,50,"Oh right, you're with them now, are you Mark? Well tell me, is it mad to be diagnosed with a mental disorder, or is it in fact, much more mad to get up every morning to go to your boring job so you can print out lots of meaningless documents?"
169,169,2,Jeremy,False,21,"OK, well, fair enough, mate. I've said my piece, but you win. After all, you're the expert. OK, guys, let's go."
170,170,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Uh, those, I don't know, they're not important. Just give them to me, really."
171,171,2,Jeremy,False,21,"Oh, yeah, didn't I, didn't I tell you? Yeah, um, she's giving us the place. So just hand them over, really."
172,172,2,Jeremy,False,18,"Well, yeah. I mean, it's all perfectly legal, probably, Mark. I don't really see what you're worried about."
173,173,2,Jeremy,False,21,"Mark, we're not exploiting her. Once we turn the pub into a cash cow, we'll give her some of the cream."
174,174,2,Jeremy,False,36,"God, you're loving this, aren't you? Holding the deeds like Mr. Monopoly with his top hat and his iron. Do you really think if you don't give us her pub, she's gonna let you screw her?"
175,175,2,Jeremy,False,23,Are you saying I'm mad? Is that what you're saying? Are you gonna try and get me sectioned for simply following my dream?
176,176,2,Jeremy,False,27,"Well, I don't know, I mean, I mean mostly he's OK. But maybe, maybe you should keep him in for observation, just for a couple of days."
177,177,2,Jeremy,False,20,"If you try to section me, Mark, you have crossed the line, and I will section you, so help me!"
178,178,3,Jeremy,False,2,Big Suze.
179,179,3,Jeremy,False,39,"Hi, I thought you might like these. They're flowers, obviously. I mean, they'll die eventually, but then everything does, doesn't it? You know, apart from love, a true love. A good love can sustain you all the way through-"
180,180,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh yeah, of course, sure, sure. Of course. Well, how about tonight. I mean, are you free?"
181,181,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Oh, just, Mark's going to Frankfurt, and I thought, maybe if you fancied, a magic mushroom party at my place."
182,182,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh, Suze, it's not scary. You just lose your sense of who you are, and all that shit."
183,183,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Of course. Suze, they're mushrooms, they're completely natural. Nothing natural ever hurt anybody, that's a scientific fact."
184,184,3,Jeremy,False,33,"Yeah, exactly. I mean, if people only did everything they wanted, everyone would just spend all day sitting on the carpet watching the Poker Channel, wanking and eating those expensive German biscuits. Probably."
185,185,3,Jeremy,False,3,Mark! You're home.
186,186,3,Jeremy,False,16,"You've only been gone an hour. What happened? Did you, er, did you forget your passport?"
187,187,3,Jeremy,False,38,"But, you're never ill. And even when you are, you stay at work, because you believe those adverts about the man in marketing stealing your job if you take the day off rather than buying their horrible products."
188,188,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Well, you look like shit. But you sound surprisingly chirpy."
189,189,3,Jeremy,False,14,"Yeah, bit hammy. But then, I'm a stern critic. This is my whole area."
190,190,3,Jeremy,False,22,"No! If you want to convince him you're ill, you have to go mano a mano. Answerphone is the waster's dream ticket."
191,191,3,Jeremy,True,27,This is a fucking disaster. The sick man of Europe all over my mushroom party? I can't have him coughing mucus all over Big Suze's lovely face.
192,192,3,Jeremy,False,16,"God, I tell you what though, mate, I think you look OK. Are you feeling better?"
193,193,3,Jeremy,False,37,"Well, you look a lot better. And I tell you what else. Today, I'm going to dedicate myself to you. I'm going to tend you, and tend you, and tend you. You will go to the ball!"
194,194,3,Jeremy,False,4,What? I didn't know.
195,195,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Nothing, what? I don't know, is there a problem?"
196,196,3,Jeremy,False,27,"Oh, no. They didn't go in there, did they? Oh, that really is too much. I'm annoyed now. I'm so annoyed with them. That is too much."
197,197,3,Jeremy,False,15,"It's all right, Hans, it's just the handle. It's funny, you need to lift it-"
198,198,3,Jeremy,False,4,It's a short-term solution.
199,199,3,Jeremy,False,3,Yes it is.
200,200,3,Jeremy,False,37,"But Mark, I'll never get round to it. It's Yellow Pages, I won't use the right words, they'll realise I'm not proper. I'll get some cowboy, and end up on ITV2. Please, before you go to Frankfurt-"
201,201,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Mark, I'll give you anything if you'll do it."
202,202,3,Jeremy,False,1,Great.
203,203,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Ah brilliant, so how are you feeling? You feeling a lot better?"
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,13,"It's all sorted, Mark. A fair day's work for a fair day's pay."
205,205,3,Jeremy,False,3,"All right, mate?"
206,206,3,Jeremy,False,8,"No problem, mate, I'll have the kettle on."
207,207,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Oh, sure. Therapy's only for you and Tony Soprano and Jamie Theakston. The common man needs therapy too you know."
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,36,"Mark, shush, stop, relax, it's OK. It's fine. You're recuperating. Have some lunch. Three different flavours, all mixed up. Mmm, exciting! And then after that, beans. Until you're better, I'm going to cook all your meals."
209,209,3,Jeremy,False,15,"All right. Hi, Alan. No, it's Jeremy. Look- Oh, really? Oh, really?? That is fascinating."
210,210,3,Jeremy,False,13,Tom Finnemore's got the lurgy that's going round. He's not going to Frankfurt.
211,211,3,Jeremy,False,8,Johnson wants you to make the presentation instead.
212,212,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Say yes, you big idiot."
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,13,Go for it dude. You're only as ill as you think you are!
214,214,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Alan, he's coming in."
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,3,You da man!
216,216,3,Jeremy,False,4,"It's ""you da man""."
217,217,3,Jeremy,True,23,"Mushroom sex party all over your flat, while you're chomping on a bratwurst and dancing to the oompah band like a total dick."
218,218,3,Jeremy,True,34,"He probably thinks I'm a slacker. To him, it probably looks like I've done literally nothing since lunch. Well the washing-up isn't nothing, mate, and I'm going to be doing that any bloody minute."
219,219,3,Jeremy,False,12,"So, do you reckon you'll get it done soon, like by tonight?"
220,220,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Wicked. I'm just working. I'm a musician, this is work. If you want, I could do you a theme while you're carpenting. Andy's Theme."
221,221,3,Jeremy,False,12,"It's cool you've got a therapist. I mean, what's the big taboo?"
222,222,3,Jeremy,False,15,"Exactly. What's the big taboo? Answer, there isn't one. That's what so cool about it."
223,223,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh yeah. Yup, word out. Truth up, dude. Truth."
224,224,3,Jeremy,True,15,"God! Look at me, talking to a builder like we're both on the same level."
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah, ""fuck off! Fuck off, you idiots!"""
226,226,3,Jeremy,True,24,"Shit, we're so angry together. The righteous indignation of the common man. Maybe we can start a union, the woodworkers and general persons union."
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Listen bro, do you fancy a bit of a jam? I've got a bongo, we could have a cheeky toke?"
228,228,3,Jeremy,True,33,"Maybe we'll become best mates and he'll train me up to be a carpenter like Jesus. And if I get crucified, he'll start a religion in my name. Jeremism. I'm a Jeremist. Nice."
229,229,3,Jeremy,True,36,"Magic eye. Brilliant for a 'shroom party, just as long as it's something nice when you get it. Yeah, they're not gonna do a magic eye of executions are they? It'll be dolphins or Father Christmas."
230,230,3,Jeremy,False,6,Mark. What are you doing here?
231,231,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Well, I just thought, you know, why have a boring living room? Why not have more vibe."
232,232,3,Jeremy,False,44,"OK, I'm going to tell you the truth now, but only on the condition, the promise, that you don't freak out, because this really isn't a big deal. In no way the kind of big deal that you're going to pretend it is, so-"
233,233,3,Jeremy,False,25,"It's just, Big Suze and everyone, they're coming over. And you might want to make yourself scarce, because we're gonna be taking some magic mushrooms."
234,234,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Yes, and we're gonna smash down the doors of perception so we can see all the stuff that-"
235,235,3,Jeremy,False,14,"That is really there, but we don't normally see, because we're so transfixed on-"
236,236,3,Jeremy,False,29,"Oh, it's so simple for you, isn't it? But the truth that you're so scared of hearing is that in fact reality and fantasy are exactly the same thing."
237,237,3,Jeremy,False,26,"But this is my big chance with Big Suze. I'm gonna get us both really high, and then try to put my hand up her jumper."
238,238,3,Jeremy,False,17,Yes. And I think it would be a lot better if you just stayed in your room.
239,239,3,Jeremy,False,43,"No, it's just you'll be bored. We'll be off our heads talking about the amazing things you can do with hemp, not the interest rates and grisly murders that you're into. Look, please, Mark. Please promise to stay in your room all night."
240,240,3,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, well, actually-"
241,241,3,Jeremy,False,27,He's trying to diddle us. He's taking the piss. There are girls coming over to take 'shrooms. They're gonna have to go to the loo in public.
242,242,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, for God's sake."
243,243,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Look, sorry, mate, it's actually not cool."
244,244,3,Jeremy,False,11,The door. It might be best if you finish it tonight.
245,245,3,Jeremy,False,23,"It's just Mark, my mate. He's a bit of a carrot up the old arse about this kind of thing and he says-"
246,246,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Well, anyway, look, I really need it done by tonight, OK?"
247,247,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Look, you've got to just do it now, OK? It's your job. I'm ordering you to do it. I'm the boss, you're the worker."
248,248,3,Jeremy,True,18,"Please don't hit me. Good, he hasn't hit me. Maybe I should hit him. Oh no, he's gone."
249,249,3,Jeremy,True,27,This is a nightmare. We can't all sit in my bloody room. What if one of us goes out and sees him? Immediate bad vibe. Hold on...
250,250,3,Jeremy,False,11,"It's all right, Mark. I'll take your Lemsip through for you."
251,251,3,Jeremy,True,83,"Am I going to do this? Am I going to do this? I've got an evil plan. I'm like a Bond villain, or a young Richard Branson. I'm sort of poisoning my flatmate. Is that OK? Doesn't sound great. ""Why did you poison your flatmate?"" ""So I could have a party."" But I'm only poisoning him a tiny, tiny bit. It's really a white poisoning, a friendly poisoning. It's just so much more civilised than bonking him on the head with a hammer."
252,252,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Hi, mate."
253,253,3,Jeremy,True,28,"Shit. Could this actually kill him? It's not going to kill him. It's just loads and loads of medicine. He'll probably wake up in three days, completely cured."
254,254,3,Jeremy,False,6,You should drink all that down.
255,255,3,Jeremy,True,6,That's right. Drink it all down.
256,256,3,Jeremy,False,5,"OK, have a nice nap."
257,257,3,Jeremy,True,21,It'll be OK. It's not like I'm going to rape him. I could rape him. I'm not going to rape him.
258,258,3,Jeremy,False,36,"Oh yeah, sorry about that. What I was thinking was, I'll just wedge the door in and hold it while you... yeah? I won't be listening or anything. I mean, I'll hear, but I won't listen."
259,259,3,Jeremy,False,17,"OK honey, you go ahead and do your lovely business, and I'll jam this sucker in place."
260,260,3,Jeremy,True,66,"I bet she even does nice poos, little Maltesers that smell like the Body Shop. Just go and check on the victim. Not victim, patient. Patient's nicer. He's fine. Mustn't think I've killed him. Definite bad trip. I almost certainly haven't killed him. Might be best if I just... No need to think about what I'm doing too much. Out of sight, out of mind. Brilliant."
261,261,3,Jeremy,False,1,Nope.
262,262,3,Jeremy,False,6,"Don't worry, Suze. There's no banging."
263,263,3,Jeremy,False,7,It's this banging track. That's what's banging.
264,264,3,Jeremy,False,7,"No, Suze, don't, don't do that. Just..."
265,265,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Mark I'm sorry, but can you please keep down the banging."
266,266,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Look please, be quiet, OK?"
267,267,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Do your business in there if you have to. God, you're disgusting."
268,268,3,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah, that was a good impression. Maybe I should run us a bath right now."
269,269,3,Jeremy,True,3,Hot diggity dog!
270,270,3,Jeremy,False,11,The pizza man is here! Pizza in the bath! Soapy Margherita!
271,271,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Shut up, Mark! Honestly. Give me a pizza the action!"
272,272,3,Jeremy,False,5,Johnson?! What do you want?
273,273,3,Jeremy,False,9,Falsely imprisoned! What a drama queen! He's not here.
274,274,3,Jeremy,False,4,Nothing. Why would I-
275,275,3,Jeremy,False,13,Oh for God's sake. If you're going to be like that about it.
276,276,3,Jeremy,False,13,"No, no, no. Just stay in that room. Stay in the nice room."
277,277,3,Jeremy,False,20,"No don't be sick, you can't be sick. Let's dance! Don't be sick. Go and look at the magic eye."
278,278,3,Jeremy,False,5,"No, you can't just- but..."
279,279,3,Jeremy,False,43,"You had to do it, didn't you? You just couldn't let me be happy. You had to go crying to Daddy just as soon as I locked you in your room for one single minute. You just can't take a joke can you?"
280,280,3,Jeremy,False,38,"So this is my big evening, is it? Me, tripping my nuts off, watching you do endless pooing. If I were you, I'd think about what you've done. Just have a long hard think about what you've done."
281,281,4,Jeremy,False,2,"OK, bye."
282,282,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Mark, that was your sister, she'll be here in an hour."
283,283,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Yes, your sister. She's coming to stay, remember? I left you a message."
284,284,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah. She rang a couple of nights ago, she's broken up with her husband, she's coming to stay."
285,285,4,Jeremy,False,10,It's great isn't it? Getting everything out in the open.
286,286,4,Jeremy,False,8,I think it's different when you're a musician.
287,287,4,Jeremy,False,23,"Yeah, I'm a musician. I really think that music really opens you up emotionally. A lot of musicians like me feel that way."
288,288,4,Jeremy,False,17,Yeah. Mark's not too musical. He bought a clarinet but he uses it to hit a cymbal.
289,289,4,Jeremy,False,22,"It was a visa marriage, it's symptomless, and it's a platonic love as you might have for a dog or a sandwich."
290,290,4,Jeremy,False,1,What?
291,291,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Look, Mark, she's your sister. I know that, yeah?"
292,292,4,Jeremy,False,10,I promise I will try not to sleep with her.
293,293,4,Jeremy,False,6,I promised to try not to.
294,294,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Mark, I tried incredibly hard. It just turns out it was literally impossible not to."
295,295,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Cool, thanks."
296,296,4,Jeremy,False,26,"Easy money. Turns out getting a job doesn't involve spending hours and hours making sure every single word on your CV is spelt right, eh Mark?"
297,297,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh Mark, mate, it isn't like that at all."
298,298,4,Jeremy,False,15,"She's not a refugee Mark, she's a twenty-nine year old solicitor... with a great arse."
299,299,4,Jeremy,False,21,"Mark, mate, look, this wasn't just a shag. As soon as I met her I had these strong, almost uncontrollable feelings."
300,300,4,Jeremy,False,27,"I think, I think I love her. I think I've fallen in love with her. You can't blame me for falling in love with her can you?"
301,301,4,Jeremy,False,54,"Oh right, well, there's not much I can really do about that, is there? Unless you want me to buy her, like, the biggest puppy or heart-shaped cushion in the world. Is that literally what you want me to do? Buy her a puppy the size of Digby, the biggest dog in the world?"
302,302,4,Jeremy,False,3,You're looking well.
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,17,"How's work? ""How's work?"" he says. You've seen The Killing Fields, right? What's Big Suze doing here?"
304,304,4,Jeremy,False,7,She said you two have been out.
305,305,4,Jeremy,False,15,"The what, what's going on? Do you fancy her? Are you in love with her?"
306,306,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah, well you better not be. Oh, and thanks for telling Sarah that I'm in love with her."
307,307,4,Jeremy,False,33,"Look, I'm in love with her all right. It's just, you know, she wants to talk about it, a lot. Which I'm fine with, but, you know, while I'm eating a jacket potato?"
308,308,4,Jeremy,False,6,You are in love with her!
309,309,4,Jeremy,False,14,Yes you bloody are. You practically crucified me the day I changed your homepage.
310,310,4,Jeremy,False,27,"I know you Corrigan. How dare you. You've got no business being in love with Big Suze, there's enough people in love with her already, she's full."
311,311,4,Jeremy,False,6,I don't care. I'm just interested.
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Well, being interested sometimes makes people angry, Mark. I thought that was common knowledge."
313,313,4,Jeremy,True,87,"How can Mark be in love with Big Suze? It's like Swaziland trying to invade China. It's a bloody political joke. Yeah, well, while you're failing to get anywhere at all with my ex, Mark, I'm doing the nasty with your very own sister. Not really in the moment though. What's wrong? Got my sex mix on. Is it? She can't. Does she? God, she does, she smells like Mark. She must use the same talcum powder. Who still uses talcum powder? Bollocks. Gotta get into this."
314,314,4,Jeremy,False,15,"You know, if you want you could, you know, slip a finger up my arse?"
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,6,Up my bum. Up my bottom.
316,316,4,Jeremy,False,3,"No, sure, sorry."
317,317,4,Jeremy,True,13,Oh my God. That's... she's... Mark. I've basically got my penis inside Mark.
318,318,4,Jeremy,False,19,"So you're really gonna do this? Dinner for four. Me, you, Big Suze and Sarah. You're such a bastard."
319,319,4,Jeremy,False,46,"OK, look, I know you're gonna say no to this but I said I'd ask. Sarah's looking for a place to stay for the next few months and I said probably not because it's a small flat and that's your view, and there'd be bathroom issues."
320,320,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Well, yeah, of course. I mean obviously, Mark, that's obvious. I'd be very, very happy."
321,321,4,Jeremy,True,33,Why should I have to take responsibility for my actions? I just do my actions. It's not like I spend hours and hours thinking about them. What kind of life would that be?
322,322,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, actually, it sounds like it should be... fine."
323,323,4,Jeremy,True,13,"Christ, there's a Mark in here and a Mark in there. I'm surrounded."
324,324,4,Jeremy,False,10,"Um, yeah, no, she's great. She's on the phone, but-"
325,325,4,Jeremy,False,4,Oh I couldn't possibly...
326,326,4,Jeremy,False,17,"No. I mean, I hope it does. But nothing does, does it? So, I'm just being realistic."
327,327,4,Jeremy,False,8,"So, Suze, how's everything with your bloke? Whatshisname?"
328,328,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh Suze, sorry, I had no idea. I'm here for you."
329,329,4,Jeremy,False,3,"Your sister, really?"
330,330,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Mmm, but she was taking a call from your dad Mark, so maybe if it's family stuff you should..."
331,331,4,Jeremy,False,17,"All right, yep, fine. I'll go and talk to her. It'll be good to hear about everything."
332,332,4,Jeremy,True,18,"Whilst she's talking, I'll just use my mind to think about other things. She can't stop my mind."
333,333,4,Jeremy,False,11,You OK love bumps? Do you want to talk about it?
334,334,4,Jeremy,True,31,"Great, here we go. This is an hour of my life I'll never get back. While Mark and Big Suze do lovely chatting I get put through the emotional mincing machine."
335,335,4,Jeremy,False,2,You are?
336,336,4,Jeremy,True,5,"Simon, you are a God!"
337,337,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, wow."
338,338,4,Jeremy,False,4,Sarah. Que sera sera.
339,339,4,Jeremy,False,2,Adios amigo.
340,340,4,Jeremy,True,21,"Oh my God, she's actually going. She's going. Freedom in five, four, three, two, one. Olé olé! Olé olé, feeling hot..."
341,341,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Oh, you know, I'm just happy. I just heard that Jamiroquai are playing Reading. I fucking love those guys."
342,342,4,Jeremy,False,11,"She's off to meet Simon. They're u, they're getting back together."
343,343,4,Jeremy,False,4,"No, not at all."
344,344,4,Jeremy,False,19,"No need to pretend? Well, maybe it's time you stopped pretending not to be in love with Big Suze."
345,345,4,Jeremy,False,3,"OK, fair enough."
346,346,4,Jeremy,False,5,Let's crack open the gin.
347,347,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Oh, this looks like a very sweet scene. What exactly is going on here?"
348,348,4,Jeremy,False,9,You realise what he's doing in here don't you?
349,349,4,Jeremy,False,6,He bloody loves you. It's pathetic.
350,350,4,Jeremy,False,9,I bet you've got a hard on haven't you?
351,351,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Well, stand up straight, take your trousers off."
352,352,4,Jeremy,False,16,"If you're innocent you've got nothing to hide, have you. Come on, let's have a look!"
353,353,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Let me feel it! It's hard, isn't it?"
354,354,4,Jeremy,False,38,"Oh right, it's a human body. Suddenly you're admitting to having a human body. You're no bloody eunuch that's for sure. I'm going to answer the door now Mark, but I'm coming back for you, and your cock."
355,355,4,Jeremy,False,1,What?
356,356,4,Jeremy,True,7,She's back. This is a fucking nightmare.
357,357,4,Jeremy,True,20,How am I gonna get out of this? She's like one of those horrible big turds that just won't flush.
358,358,4,Jeremy,False,9,"If you want, I could call you a cab?"
359,359,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, right, yes. Of course."
360,360,4,Jeremy,True,6,"Oh please Simon, take her back."
361,361,4,Jeremy,False,10,"I can't really because- yes. Hold on, give me five."
362,362,4,Jeremy,False,28,"Listen, I'm just going to the pub with Big Suze. Sarah's in the loo in a bit of a state, will you tell her I've finished with her?"
363,363,4,Jeremy,False,26,"Just be nice about it though, because I really do love her. And tell her it's not her, it's me, and I've got commitment issues, yeah?"
364,364,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Oh all right. What should I be having? Gentleman's relish with olives? Anyway, Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes are just Frosties for wankers."
365,365,5,Jeremy,False,3,Anything from Soph?
366,366,5,Jeremy,False,3,That sounds important.
367,367,5,Jeremy,False,7,Have you told her you love her?
368,368,5,Jeremy,False,35,"No, no, mate, Saying I love you puts you in the driving seat. Sometimes I tell them I love them early on on a first date, just to get things off to a good start."
369,369,5,Jeremy,False,8,No. Maybe. A bit. Who cares? It works.
370,370,5,Jeremy,False,16,"What? No, it's boring. ""You may have won this"", ""you may owe us that."" Who cares?"
371,371,5,Jeremy,False,34,"Oh, sure, it's On Her Majesty's Service, delivered by the Royal Mail. Probably an invitation to one of Princess Anne's shepherds pie and dogging parties. See? Now they want me to do jury service."
372,372,5,Jeremy,False,6,Why shouldn't I do jury service?
373,373,5,Jeremy,False,3,"No, I wouldn't."
374,374,5,Jeremy,False,4,It's a complicated film.
375,375,5,Jeremy,False,17,"Anyway, I'd probably find jury service pretty simple. Because whatever it is, I'll just let them off."
376,376,5,Jeremy,False,19,"It's probably some young black kid whose been accused of stealing a bun, and I'm gonna set him free."
377,377,5,Jeremy,False,18,That's what they want you to do - hear the details and confuse you. I'm definitely gonna acquit.
378,378,5,Jeremy,False,21,"Mark, I've taken a solemn oath. I know that doesn't mean a lot to you but I take it quite seriously."
379,379,5,Jeremy,False,18,"It's credit card fraud, and it's a woman. Six counts, four in the Nescliffe area, two in Cosford."
380,380,5,Jeremy,False,27,"Oh, sure, it sounds incredible for the first three hours. God, it's boring. ""Are you guilty?"", ""Blah, blah, blah."" I mean It's a joke, she's obviously guilty."
381,381,5,Jeremy,False,7,"She's the guilty type, she looks shifty."
382,382,5,Jeremy,False,31,Yeah you know the type. Dressed up all nice for court but wouldn't look out of place with a can of strong lager and an incredibly cheap fag in her mouth.
383,383,5,Jeremy,False,30,"She's white. Plus I was talking to another jury bloke and he thinks the same. I think we're all thinking the same basically you know, there's no smoke without fire."
384,384,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Mark, relax She's going down. And if she didn't do it, so what? She's the type, she'd probably just do something else."
385,385,5,Jeremy,True,34,"Oh the jury is so boring. Why couldn't I get something interesting, like a cat-strangling, or a murder case that goes right to the heart of government? Oh, my God it's her. The defendant."
386,386,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah. Yeah, I am a bit. Sorry."
387,387,5,Jeremy,False,4,Yup! I probably shouldn't...
388,388,5,Jeremy,False,23,"To be honest, it's nice to get away from the jury. They're so boring. All they want to talk about is the case."
389,389,5,Jeremy,True,1,Shit.
390,390,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, just uh... we all think you're innocent."
391,391,5,Jeremy,True,6,Just sugar the pill a bit.
392,392,5,Jeremy,False,1,Jeremy.
393,393,5,Jeremy,False,37,"Oh God, tell me about it. That's why I sit in the corner, because you can sort of lean against the wall, and then if it gets a bit boring you can- you know, it's just better."
394,394,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Oh God, yeah. He's so judgmental. ""I rule this, I rule that""."
395,395,5,Jeremy,False,1,Objection!
396,396,5,Jeremy,True,7,"This isn't wrong, just illegal. Like drink-driving."
397,397,5,Jeremy,True,17,"Oh I'm the foreman, I'm the foreman. Only I get to talk to the judge. Fuck you."
398,398,5,Jeremy,True,18,"They can't send her down, they don't know her. I don't know her. But I do fancy her."
399,399,5,Jeremy,False,19,"Er, yeah, I just don't think she is that guilty. I mean I think there is a reasonable doubt."
400,400,5,Jeremy,True,17,I'm in Twelve Angry Men. I'm the only one who's not angry. I'm horny. That's much nicer.
401,401,5,Jeremy,False,4,Haha! Haha haha. Hurhurhurhur.
402,402,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, nothing. Doesn't matter."
403,403,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Er, yeah, it is, kind of."
404,404,5,Jeremy,False,5,"It's really... honestly, it's nothing."
405,405,5,Jeremy,False,16,"No, no, it's nothing like that. Anyway that doesn't matter any more because she's definitely innocent."
406,406,5,Jeremy,False,22,"No, Nothing came out, it's just I got to know her a bit and it's obvious she wouldn't do something like that."
407,407,5,Jeremy,False,17,"Yeah. We bumped into each other, we've been texting, we're going to go out for a drink."
408,408,5,Jeremy,False,27,The only seat in the cafe was next to her. What was I supposed to do? Blank her? That's against the law. The law of social niceness.
409,409,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh right, so suddenly I can't go out drinking with the defendant. Well why not?"
410,410,5,Jeremy,False,21,"Oh that is typical. ""Jeremy can't be trusted to judge the woman he's sleeping with but... but Tony Blair can."" Yeah?"
411,411,5,Jeremy,False,25,"Look Mark, I'm a musician in case you'd forgotten. Yeah? I answer to a higher law, the law of, ""If it feels good, do it."""
412,412,5,Jeremy,False,22,"It's the musicians' law. Colonel Gaddafi could not lay down a bass hook, Mark. That should be clear even to you. God!"
413,413,5,Jeremy,False,18,Oh Carla says she's sorry she couldn't make it for a drink but she'll meet us here instead.
414,414,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, that's quite funny, actually."
415,415,5,Jeremy,False,5,And I'm on the jury!
416,416,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Yep, gay, gay-friendly."
417,417,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh Mark, what? You think you're irresistible?!"
418,418,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, well just don't go over into that corner 'cause that's where the guys who like straight acting, tubby homophobes hang out."
419,419,5,Jeremy,False,8,Is erm...? That isn't... is that your name?
420,420,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, right. The old magic card."
421,421,5,Jeremy,True,30,"God she's amazing. She sees something she wants and she takes it. None of the ""Is this mine or is it someone else's?"" crap. She probably has men queuing up."
422,422,5,Jeremy,False,9,"You know what, Carla? I think I love you."
423,423,5,Jeremy,False,15,So what? I'm a musician. I think on my feet. I speak with my heart.
424,424,5,Jeremy,True,3,"Yep, Jailhouse Rock."
425,425,5,Jeremy,False,23,"Who'd have thought it ey? You and me out clubbing, you off your tits. I can genuinely see us eventually reminiscing about this."
426,426,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh Mark, why didn't you bang one?"
427,427,5,Jeremy,False,22,Mark that is so not the E experience. You're much more likely to wake up with depression and a sense of worthlessness.
428,428,5,Jeremy,False,53,"OK, look. Like, when you're coming up, it's kind of... Yeah? And then you're just- I mean, everything you do is just kind of... Yeah. And then when you're going down, you sort of just talk about how we're all the same but there are these systems that keep us apart and stuff."
429,429,5,Jeremy,True,22,"What? She wants to talk normally after what we just did? I mean, I like edgy sex, but where was the humanity?"
430,430,5,Jeremy,False,4,Yeah? Don't you think..
431,431,5,Jeremy,False,5,Do you think? I mean-
432,432,5,Jeremy,False,10,Yeah I think he actually works in a juice bar.
433,433,5,Jeremy,False,16,"So, about the case. Um, just between us, the credit cards, that was you, was it?"
434,434,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Brilliant. Ooh, nasty scar."
435,435,5,Jeremy,False,1,Brilliant.
436,436,5,Jeremy,True,20,"Oh, fuck. This is getting a bit too real. Just keep kissing. If we're kissing, she can't say scary stuff."
437,437,5,Jeremy,False,2,Again? Already?
438,438,5,Jeremy,True,23,"Oh, no. She's going to go free and come and live here, and we'll have to do horrible sex and go carjacking together."
439,439,5,Jeremy,True,25,"Bollocks. She's going to go free, free to come round and cut me from ear to ear unless I do her evil doings with her."
440,440,5,Jeremy,False,12,Why bother? We're never going to agree. She's going to get off.
441,441,5,Jeremy,True,24,"Shit. Could I do this? She is technically innocent. But, really, she's totally guilty. Plus, women's prison, it's probably like one long hen night."
442,442,5,Jeremy,False,21,"Well, actually, I was thinking, I've had quite a big think about everything and, um, I think I've changed my mind."
443,443,5,Jeremy,False,33,"Partially, but basically, I accidentally got talking to her in a club. I know I shouldn't have, but it turns out she does this sort of thing all the time. She's a fraudster."
444,444,5,Jeremy,False,98,"OK, sure. If you want. Say it's a mistrial, go crying to Daddy. But look, maybe I didn't play by the rules this time. Maybe I am a bit of a maverick, but I think I've got this case pretty much solved. And, yes, I can apologise for how I've done that, but I could never apologise for telling the truth. And the truth is that this woman is evil! And if we let her go today, we are going to be responsible for whatever she does, so help me God, and let the Lord be my witness!"
445,445,5,Jeremy,True,20,"Oh, yeah, justice is done. Not actual justice, but what I wanted to happen, which is basically the same thing."
446,446,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Propose? To Sophie? Oh my God, this is massive!"
447,447,6,Jeremy,True,33,"How does it affect me? Shit, I can't manage on my own. He knows what lottery numbers we do. I'll have to do lucky dips. I'm never gonna win on a lucky dip."
448,448,6,Jeremy,False,13,"I mean, but why? I didn't think things were going all that well."
449,449,6,Jeremy,False,6,So therefore you must get married?
450,450,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah, of course I am, it's the best thing on the board."
451,451,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Mark, just look at it, it's tiny, it's red. It's right in the bloody middle, course it's the best thing on the board."
452,452,6,Jeremy,False,1,Why?
453,453,6,Jeremy,False,6,You've got enough for two rooms?
454,454,6,Jeremy,False,19,"Oh come on Mark, I could take Big Suze, break the log jam for us, weekend in the Boondocks."
455,455,6,Jeremy,False,21,"Mark, think about it. What if she says no? You'll be trapped in an emotional shit-storm, you're gonna need back up."
456,456,6,Jeremy,False,11,Cool. If she can't make it I'll just take Super Hans.
457,457,6,Jeremy,False,9,"I'm kidding. Bloody hell Mark, give me some credit."
458,458,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Yeah, are you sure this is cool? I mean we'll have to steer clear of Mark."
459,459,6,Jeremy,False,15,Yeah well I suppose it's a good chance to get away and do the demo.
460,460,6,Jeremy,False,27,"Yeah, living it large on the mini bar while Big Suze is playing the bloody Peter's Friends drinking game with Hugo and Otto and Rozzle and Nozzle."
461,461,6,Jeremy,False,4,You not having one?
462,462,6,Jeremy,False,10,"You're kicking... everything? All right, but you don't mind me...?"
463,463,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, OK."
464,464,6,Jeremy,True,7,"Yeah, I'll give him about five minutes."
465,465,6,Jeremy,False,13,"No, sure mate, yeah. Well, I'm on it. Right well let's crack on."
466,466,6,Jeremy,True,27,"Great, weekend with a junkie going cold turkey. I should just leave him. What's the worst that could happen? He could die, that would be quite bad."
467,467,6,Jeremy,False,1,Hans.
468,468,6,Jeremy,False,15,"No. Come on mate, I'm not gonna give you any intoxicants. You made me promise."
469,469,6,Jeremy,False,3,"No mate, no."
470,470,6,Jeremy,False,6,There's no need to be nasty.
471,471,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Hey Big Suze, how you doing?"
472,472,6,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah no, nothing much just you know hanging out, chilling. Yeah that would be nice, cool, cool cool coolio."
473,473,6,Jeremy,False,11,"That was big Suze, guess what? She's coming over after all."
474,474,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Super Hans, are you trying to skin up with your feet again? Because it doesn't work does it? It just makes a mess."
475,475,6,Jeremy,True,40,"God she's come down to see me, this is amazing, walking in the grounds of a country hotel. If there wasn't a junkie in my room shitting and retching and hurling, it would be like Pride & Prejudice or something."
476,476,6,Jeremy,True,11,"Ooh, wasn't listening, just keeping saying general words, should be OK."
477,477,6,Jeremy,False,19,"Shit yeah, God. I sometimes think stuff like that. You know, kind of, deep stuff, shit, in your head."
478,478,6,Jeremy,False,3,Hi Super Hans.
479,479,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah, no, tuck into the Kit Kats."
480,480,6,Jeremy,False,10,Well good luck with that and I'll see you later.
481,481,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah he's fine, he's back in London reading a classic car mag."
482,482,6,Jeremy,True,22,She's actually hot for me but can't use the room. Maybe we could do it behind a bush or... under a car?
483,483,6,Jeremy,False,1,Mark!
484,484,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Nothing. I'm just here with Big Suze, you said that was allowed."
485,485,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, I'll just go and check on that, yeah?"
486,486,6,Jeremy,False,28,"Well the thing is and don't, don't, don't take this badly but Super Hans has come up but you'll approve because he's trying to come off the drugs."
487,487,6,Jeremy,False,4,Is she not OK?
488,488,6,Jeremy,True,16,"I don't wanna go but apparently you can't just do whatever you want because of ""civilisation""."
489,489,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, sure mate. Did she say where she was?"
490,490,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh great, well that should be simple enough then."
491,491,6,Jeremy,False,1,Sophie!
492,492,6,Jeremy,False,9,Did she say what sort of rock it was?
493,493,6,Jeremy,False,9,Why were you phoning me anyway you big idiot?
494,494,6,Jeremy,False,9,"What stuff, you're not having gay feelings again, Mark?"
495,495,6,Jeremy,False,13,Oh for fuck sake. Mark is this- are we going the right way?
496,496,6,Jeremy,False,8,"Except we went down and then up, so-"
497,497,6,Jeremy,False,29,"Oh great, so we have no idea where we are and there might be a storm coming in and we haven't got any stuff and- brilliant, we're dead meat!"
498,498,6,Jeremy,False,20,"Exmoor? The moors, the barren moors, the moors murderers? We could easily die on a moor. Give me your phone."
499,499,6,Jeremy,False,5,I'm gonna call Mountain Rescue.
500,500,6,Jeremy,False,5,That's what they're there for!
501,501,6,Jeremy,False,21,"What, you'd be rather one of the idiots they find frozen to death being chewed by badgers, drinking their own piss?"
502,502,6,Jeremy,False,38,"Oh right, they're gonna leave me to die because I haven't got a geography degree. You'd prefer that, wouldn't you? To die, rather than to ask for a simple piece of help? We are so going to die."
503,503,6,Jeremy,False,3,What is it?
504,504,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Look just come here mate, I've got you. Come on, look come and sit over here."
505,505,6,Jeremy,True,12,"Ah ankle, here we go, in couple of hours we'll be dead."
506,506,6,Jeremy,False,26,"Look seriously mate, do you want me to go up there? I'll march up there a bit and try and get a bit of reception, yeah?"
507,507,6,Jeremy,False,1,No?
508,508,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Ah, so, now you're admitting that one of us might die!"
509,509,6,Jeremy,False,24,"Rationing? Can't we just have a bit? We've only been lost for twenty minutes and you want to start rationing, let's just eat it!"
510,510,6,Jeremy,False,34,"Oh, you love rationing, don't you? You've been waiting for an opportunity to do rationing on me since the day we met and finally, finally, one's coming along and you love it, don't you?"
511,511,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Bollocks, give me my half now. You can ration yourself if you're so keen on it."
512,512,6,Jeremy,False,16,"The spirit of the Blitz lives on, fucking hell. That is good, that is so good."
513,513,6,Jeremy,False,6,Can I have a bit more?
514,514,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Oh come on, just a bit. My half of the fourth chunk, come on."
515,515,6,Jeremy,False,35,"Oh come on Mark, you knew what would happen as soon as you mentioned chocolate you knew I'd want to eat it. You know my nature. This isn't fair, you're using my nature against me."
516,516,6,Jeremy,False,11,"All right, sure mate, sure. And thanks mate, for the chocolate."
517,517,6,Jeremy,False,26,"Oh look a frisbee, somebody left a frisbee. We could use this to dig, or maybe catch something? A bird if you threw it really hard."
518,518,6,Jeremy,False,13,"So listen mate, about this whole, um, you asking Sophie to get married."
519,519,6,Jeremy,False,18,"I mean, it's brilliant and everything, but, I was just wondering, have you considered, like, not doing it?"
520,520,6,Jeremy,False,27,"No obviously and after all that... clipping, you're gonna want to have something to show for it. Like a wife. But, is it really a good idea?"
521,521,6,Jeremy,False,38,"Ah yeah. But you see, Super Hans is obsessed with crack and poppers and dusting his knob with speed but it doesn't make it right, does it? I mean, what is it about her that you actually love?"
522,522,6,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
523,523,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh yeah, I know that one."
524,524,6,Jeremy,False,6,Before you really had a relationship?
525,525,6,Jeremy,False,5,Well maybe that's a sign?
526,526,6,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh don't give up on women mate. I mean there's she-males, hookers, Thai brides, all God's rich tapestry."
527,527,6,Jeremy,False,18,"Great, fantastic. Well let's go down shall we? We can snaffle the rest of the choco, go fifty-fifty."
528,528,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Err no, this way, down, yeah? Down the mountain, remember?"
529,529,6,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah, normally I give in but today I'm right and I don't want to go back up the mountain."
530,530,6,Jeremy,False,36,"Oh great, the secret Twix. When were you going to tell me about this? Or were you going to wait until I was dead and then have it for dessert after you'd feasted on my carcass?"
531,531,6,Jeremy,True,15,"Fucking hell, that took forever, finally back. He's always right. Why is he always right?"
532,532,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, I know, honey. Look, just give me five, yeah."
533,533,6,Jeremy,True,28,"Wow, I'm just so tired and hungry and cold. She's gonna have a hell of a job coaxing a hard-on out of me, but I bet she'll manage."
534,534,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh Hans, Super Hans!"
535,535,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Hi Super Hans, how are you doing? I just wondered whether you still wanted some drugs?"
536,536,6,Jeremy,False,24,"And that's definitely your settled decision as a grown-up man, so, I've got nothing to feel guilty about if, say, I gave you some?"
537,537,6,Jeremy,False,28,"OK. Well this is a big bag of drugs. And all I'm gonna do is just tape it on here like this. And then you know, have fun."
538,538,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Hey Soph, where's the Markster? practising his ""I told you so's""?"
539,539,6,Jeremy,False,2,You're kidding?!
540,540,6,Jeremy,False,21,"I didn't kill him. I mean, I had the opportunity but no motive. I mean, don't worry Sophie, he'll be fine."
541,541,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Mark! Mark, you're safe, brilliant."
542,542,6,Jeremy,False,21,"And I was right, you were wrong. Look, you're wet through and really unhappy, all because you didn't listen to me."
543,543,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, I was right. Look at you, you're actually shivering. Brilliant."
544,544,6,Jeremy,False,4,"No, no they're not."
545,545,6,Jeremy,False,2,You are?
546,546,6,Jeremy,False,7,So you feeling all right now mate?
547,547,6,Jeremy,False,3,"So, Mark, congrats."
548,548,6,Jeremy,False,13,"So, what the fuck? I mean, what happened? Did you change your mind?"
549,549,6,Jeremy,False,1,Right?
550,550,6,Jeremy,False,4,But you hadn't asked.
551,551,6,Jeremy,False,5,So you accepted the acceptance?
552,552,6,Jeremy,False,7,Except for telling her how you felt.
553,553,6,Jeremy,False,12,"What, so you're going to get married to her out of embarrassment?"
554,554,6,Jeremy,False,7,I suppose you could always get divorced.
555,555,6,Jeremy,False,17,So you're gonna stay married to this woman for the rest of your life because of embarrassment?
556,556,6,Jeremy,False,6,Fair enough. To the happy couple!
557,557,1,Mark,True,59,"Tonight's the night, Sophie's actually coming over, for some work. I don't actually think there'll be much work, except sex work. Don't think of it like work. Fish pie, then missionary sex and Newsnight afterwards. Classic. Might make a joke about Paxman and the economics woman. Paxo... Paxo wants to stuff... stuffing... there's got to be a joke there."
558,558,1,Mark,False,1,What?
559,559,1,Mark,False,1,Why?
560,560,1,Mark,False,6,Don't you have your own phone?
561,561,1,Mark,False,10,"Right, it's just ""neither a lender nor a borrower be""."
562,562,1,Mark,False,8,"No, God, no, it's just it's a Blackberry."
563,563,1,Mark,True,26,"Do me? Are they gonna rape me? Or kill me? If they rape and kill me, I hope they kill me first. I sort of win."
564,564,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
565,565,1,Mark,False,4,There's my travel card.
566,566,1,Mark,True,10,"That's great, help the muggers, what do you want, approval?"
567,567,1,Mark,True,6,(Oh this really takes the biscuit.)
568,568,1,Mark,True,16,I thought it was at least the muggers who had to run off. The victim fleas!
569,569,1,Mark,True,7,Oh this really leaves a sour taste.
570,570,1,Mark,False,2,Uh huh.
571,571,1,Mark,True,39,"No need to tell him what happened, just button up, like the 40s. People saw terrible things in the war, they didn't go on and on about them. They had a cup of tea and invented the NHS instead."
572,572,1,Mark,False,8,"Get away, fuck off! Fuck off my stuff!"
573,573,1,Mark,False,14,"Look, I- it's just, on the way home I got... these blokes... mugged me."
574,574,1,Mark,False,4,"No, not a knife."
575,575,1,Mark,False,23,No they didn't have a... there was two of them. They asked to borrow my phone but they didn't really wanna borrow it.
576,576,1,Mark,False,7,No. Then they asked for my wallet.
577,577,1,Mark,False,9,"Jeremy, I was in the underpass with these two-"
578,578,1,Mark,False,7,Mad Max is not necessarily gonna happen.
579,579,1,Mark,False,13,"Yes, well look, anyway, Sophie's coming over so I'm gonna need the cooker."
580,580,1,Mark,False,6,"Right, did you finish with Michelle?"
581,581,1,Mark,False,18,But what about... I mean I thought you were dead set on getting back together with big Suze.
582,582,1,Mark,False,9,"Right so, what about the threesome? What about Michelle?"
583,583,1,Mark,False,3,"Oh right, brilliant."
584,584,1,Mark,False,37,"Jez, look, are you sure about big Suze? It's just it took you such a long, long time to get over her leaving you. I mean in a way you never totally got over her leaving you."
585,585,1,Mark,False,23,"Thank you, Soph, thanks very much. I may not be an expert but I do my best, and that's all anyone can ask."
586,586,1,Mark,True,9,Just subtly lowering her expectations in the bedroom there.
587,587,1,Mark,False,24,"So, I was thinking maybe we could work a bit better in the bedroom. I mean it's fine if you don't want to, but-"
588,588,1,Mark,True,16,"Oh my God, she's a man eater. She's gonna chew me up and spit me out."
589,589,1,Mark,False,1,Er...
590,590,1,Mark,False,37,"Yeah I tried opening a window but a lot of them blew out, which I suppose actually shows that electric light's actually quite a lot better, although I know that's not a very fashionable thing to say."
591,591,1,Mark,True,42,"What am I talking about? Jeremy's sex CD. Better than ""Big Bond Themes"" I guess. Bond wouldn't get mugged. Bollocks, forgot to call and stop the phone. Could go out and do it now, pretend I need a dump. Not very sexy."
592,592,1,Mark,False,3,"Oh, oh yeah."
593,593,1,Mark,True,87,"Oh yeah this is it, this is really happening. Relax, stop worrying about the muggers and their free calls, I'm getting sexy. Bastards, they're probably going through my address book randomly deleting contacts. That's probably how they get their kicks. Shit, I'm not kissing right. Plus, nothing growing in the pants department. I'm as limp as a charity wristband. Got to stop thinking about the muggers. Be in the moment, Corrigan! Shit, she's snaking up the thigh, but there's nothing at the top of it. Abort! Abort!"
594,594,1,Mark,False,9,"So, great. Great, that was great, Soph. Lovely interlude."
595,595,1,Mark,False,14,"But I think we should probably... I mean, this work isn't gonna do itself."
596,596,1,Mark,False,4,Yep. The bloody work!
597,597,1,Mark,False,18,"Oh. Oh. Sure, sure you don't, Soph. Right, now where's that broadband cable? I should be able to..."
598,598,1,Mark,True,6,Please don't touch my floppy cock.
599,599,1,Mark,False,6,I want you to be sure.
600,600,1,Mark,False,10,"Oh God I want to, it's just these damn reports!"
601,601,1,Mark,True,53,"Who needs to be a man when you've got a knife? Good old Mr Patel and his illegal supply of knives. OK, come on then Mark, T-Mobile gave you the numbers the mugger called, ring the numbers. Might be able to get my Blackberry back and not get humiliated by Patrick in IT."
602,602,1,Mark,False,3,"Oh, just... nothing."
603,603,1,Mark,False,11,"Oh ha ha ha. Well, you know, at least second base."
604,604,1,Mark,True,4,"Relax, let it happen."
605,605,1,Mark,True,20,"But nothing's stirring. Uh-oh, she's gonna feel the knife. Can't let her feel the hard knife or the soft cock."
606,606,1,Mark,False,39,"Look, Sophie, this is a hell of a laugh and all, and I love horseplay and light-heartedness and having a great time, but you know, there's codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures, and it just makes me very nervous."
607,607,1,Mark,False,8,"Yes, Sophie, I know, really. Let's have fun."
608,608,1,Mark,False,21,"Look, I'm just, you know me, I'm old fashioned. I like courting. Look, can- why don't we go to the pictures?"
609,609,1,Mark,False,15,"I like your joke, Sophie, a point well made. A point well made. Later, baby."
610,610,1,Mark,True,9,"Urgh, baby. Note to self re. being the Fonz"
611,611,1,Mark,False,25,"Jeremy, I've got a lead. This kid says he can get my phone back. I've gotta meet him at Chicken Corner. I need back up."
612,612,1,Mark,False,4,"Jez, where are you?"
613,613,1,Mark,False,3,Are you drunk?
614,614,1,Mark,False,11,"Jez, you're not just buying chocolate, crisps and booze, are you?"
615,615,1,Mark,False,11,"I just hope, Jez, the drinking, it hasn't become a problem."
616,616,1,Mark,False,3,What's your plan?
617,617,1,Mark,False,7,"That's not really a plan, as such."
618,618,1,Mark,False,27,"So, thanks for coming. I mean, obviously your mate... I'm not, I don't approve of what he's done, but there's no reason why we can't be civil."
619,619,1,Mark,False,11,"So, what I'm after... what I'm demanding... is my Blackberry back."
620,620,1,Mark,False,13,"Oh, well, that would be fantastic, because it actually belongs to my office."
621,621,1,Mark,False,1,No.
622,622,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
623,623,1,Mark,False,29,"I mean, I think, I have to say, this is a bit rich, but I guess, maybe there's certain administrative costs for you to bear and so on, so..."
624,624,1,Mark,False,1,Really?
625,625,1,Mark,False,17,Cause obviously this dynamic could go on indefinitely. I mean is sixty... will that really be it?
626,626,1,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
627,627,1,Mark,False,4,"No, I really think-"
628,628,1,Mark,False,6,Can I have my Blackberry back?
629,629,1,Mark,False,7,"Can I have my Blackberry back, please?"
630,630,1,Mark,False,18,"But he hasn't got my... oh, no of course he'll have my number from when I called him."
631,631,1,Mark,True,71,"Oh Jesus, I've got to get a hard-on soon or we're finished. Maybe I was too quick to delete those spam emails about erection enhancement. One of them might just be from a misunderstood scientific genius. Oh my- is that-? Is it-? God it is, it's him, the bloody mugger! Should I run? Can't run, must maintain social veneer. Oh God, please don't hit me. Please don't hit me, not here."
632,632,1,Mark,False,8,"What? Me? No, no I don't think so."
633,633,1,Mark,False,17,"I don't think so, you're probably thinking I look a bit like one of the shadow cabinet."
634,634,1,Mark,False,8,"No, definitely not. ""Not I"", said the walrus."
635,635,1,Mark,True,11,She must never know what a pathetic man I am. Never.
636,636,1,Mark,True,34,"What kind of person am I, sitting watching a film in the company of a man who robbed me? If Dad knew he'd call me a big Jessie in his extremely unfunny gay voice."
637,637,1,Mark,False,4,It's annoying isn't it?
638,638,1,Mark,True,54,Am I just gonna sit here and have my evening ruined by some arsehole? Just like when I put my parka on backwards for a joke and Terrence Woo taped the hood over my face and everyone laughed. Well I'm not gonna take it any more! I'm not gonna fucking take it any more!
639,639,1,Mark,False,10,Maybe that'll teach you not to rustle your bloody popcorn.
640,640,1,Mark,False,6,He was really rustling. That's unacceptable.
641,641,1,Mark,False,7,I just really love those Orange ads.
642,642,1,Mark,False,8,Well I guess sometimes people can surprise you.
643,643,1,Mark,True,55,"God, she loves violence. They probably all do really. They say they want you to talk about your feelings but really they just want you to beat and gouge your rivals. Hey, there's the stirring, the unstoppable rise. It's like globalisation, it's inevitable. Hark at its stately progress. This is it, the eagle has landed."
644,644,1,Mark,False,10,"Ha ha. Captain Corrigan ready to receive his orders, sir!"
645,645,1,Mark,False,25,"Oh that, that's just a little friend of mine called Mr Cutty Knife - in case I have to chop down a rival alpha male."
646,646,1,Mark,True,13,"Oh right, so they like hitting but there's some massive taboo about stabbing."
647,647,1,Mark,False,45,"No, Soph, it's not a knife really, it's for horses hooves, whittling. Look, all right, I mean, it's just... I'd like to learn kickboxing to protect myself, I just don't have the time. So basically what this is, is just a rather efficient time-saving device."
648,648,2,Mark,True,23,"This is the life. A modern man. Might have roast beef and The Culture later, then take the Funday Times for a shit."
649,649,2,Mark,False,3,Another horrible bit?
650,650,2,Mark,True,40,"Look at me, I've got a girlfriend, a proper girlfriend reading a bestseller about child abuse. I go out and have croissants. I'm just a normal, functioning member of the human race, and there's no way anyone can prove otherwise."
651,651,2,Mark,True,16,"Oh, God. Thank God, thank God it's ending. Finally. Still got all my fingers intact, too."
652,652,2,Mark,False,6,"Oh, yeah, yeah, that was fun."
653,653,2,Mark,True,18,"Ugh, feel awful. I suppose doing things you hate is just the price you pay to avoid loneliness."
654,654,2,Mark,False,12,"Well, they all look garish and unsafe, so why don't you choose?"
655,655,2,Mark,True,23,"My girlfriend, standing next to her boyfriend reading a text like it's the most natural thing in the world. Do feel very queasy."
656,656,2,Mark,False,7,They spamming you about upgrading to 3G?
657,657,2,Mark,False,3,"Well, that's brilliant!"
658,658,2,Mark,True,3,Oh my God.
659,659,2,Mark,False,7,"Yeah, yeah, just queasy from the waltzer."
660,660,2,Mark,False,10,"No, really, it's the waltzer. I'm happy for you, really."
661,661,2,Mark,False,11,"So, this is the place you're gonna be running for Merry?"
662,662,2,Mark,False,6,Blimey. So this is a... pub?
663,663,2,Mark,False,34,"Yeah, I mean, I guess it won't be quite like being paid just to go to the pub because you'll be doing all the pub stuff, the barrels, the tubes, the debit card authorisations."
664,664,2,Mark,False,10,"OK Jez, fine, but have you done your market research?"
665,665,2,Mark,False,25,"Your market research is Field of Dreams? I mean, a man who made a baseball pitch in his garden for ghosts? That's your role model?"
666,666,2,Mark,False,9,"Listen, I'm sure this place is gonna be great."
667,667,2,Mark,False,12,I can't believe Sophie's just gone. Do you think she'll stay faithful?
668,668,2,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, I guess. Thanks, mate. Really nice of Merry to invite us to the flat warming."
669,669,2,Mark,False,7,"No, we, we never had a thing."
670,670,2,Mark,False,5,"Well, yes, but nothing happened."
671,671,2,Mark,False,8,So the pub? What are you calling it?
672,672,2,Mark,False,6,"Right, yes, I can see that."
673,673,2,Mark,True,43,"Maybe I should get off with someone at Merry's party in case Sophie does in Bristol. Yeah, right, when was the last time I got off with someone at a party? Well, there was Carol Bananaface, but that was just a macabre charade."
674,674,2,Mark,False,1,Ah.
675,675,2,Mark,True,4,"God, life is futile."
676,676,2,Mark,False,2,Just us?
677,677,2,Mark,False,14,"Uh, look, uh, I'm just gonna call Sophie, check, see what she's up to."
678,678,2,Mark,False,3,What? What's he-
679,679,2,Mark,False,18,"Well, uh, actually, it may surprise you to learn that no one's ever said that to me before."
680,680,2,Mark,True,6,"Oh my God, I'm being propositioned."
681,681,2,Mark,True,5,Letter? Popsicle? This isn't good.
682,682,2,Mark,False,3,"Right, thank you."
683,683,2,Mark,False,3,"Does it, really?"
684,684,2,Mark,True,31,"Maybe I should follow her. She's so hyper, she's probably really great at sex. But there's always the chance I'll get the toilet seat slammed on my cock for no reason."
685,685,2,Mark,False,13,"Jeremy, I think something's wrong with Merry. She... made a pass at me."
686,686,2,Mark,False,15,"No, Jez, this is serious, I'm worried about her. She's not right in the head."
687,687,2,Mark,False,14,"Don't you think... the party, the pub... I think she's gone a bit funny."
688,688,2,Mark,False,9,"Hey, Soph, long time no speak. How's it going?"
689,689,2,Mark,True,18,"Oh my God, she would've got it by now, unless Amazon screwed up, except they're so damn efficient."
690,690,2,Mark,False,2,"Uh, no?"
691,691,2,Mark,False,4,"Oh, well, blimey, I-"
692,692,2,Mark,False,10,"Uh, oh, uh, OK, so do you want to start?"
693,693,2,Mark,False,8,"OK, I'll just dive in, shall I? OK."
694,694,2,Mark,True,24,What am I gonna say? Clinton would know what to say. Blair would know what to say. Even Putin would know what to say.
695,695,2,Mark,False,6,You... have you got... nice tits?
696,696,2,Mark,False,22,"You have, you really have. And feet and arms and... you know, I don't wanna just focus on those sexual parts 'cause-"
697,697,2,Mark,False,2,"OK, good."
698,698,2,Mark,False,52,"He goes, can we get rid of him? He goes and puts his pants on. It's just you and me and... and Andrew Neil's interviewing us about politics. But when the camera's not on us, we're all hot and I'm just screwing you, and there's nothing Andrew Neil can do about it."
699,699,2,Mark,False,10,He's the ex-editor of the Sunday Times- it doesn't matter.
700,700,2,Mark,False,7,"Someone's coming in, I think it's Jeremy."
701,701,2,Mark,False,8,"No, Soph, he's back, I've got to go."
702,702,2,Mark,False,4,I get the message.
703,703,2,Mark,True,7,"Uh, what the hell is she doing?"
704,704,2,Mark,False,16,"Look, listen, Merry, have you got any phone numbers for, you know, brothers, sisters, or... people?"
705,705,2,Mark,False,6,Could you give us the numbers?
706,706,2,Mark,False,16,"Merry, I just wonder, maybe you should be heading home. Shall we call you a cab?"
707,707,2,Mark,False,7,What do you think we should do?
708,708,2,Mark,False,6,"There you go, nice and tucked."
709,709,2,Mark,False,5,That's good tucking. That's fine.
710,710,2,Mark,False,12,I don't know. I think we should try and contact someone who-
711,711,2,Mark,False,20,"Exactly, but no mum now. Did she once say something about an uncle in Canada? Or... who else is there?"
712,712,2,Mark,False,13,Don't think he's gonna take her off our hands. He works in HMV.
713,713,2,Mark,False,3,The three-digit number?
714,714,2,Mark,False,69,"OK, OK, I guess we've just got to bloody take responsibility, haven't we? Hello? NHS Direct? Hi, listen, I wanna get my friend sectioned. Yes, but I don't know what the procedure is. How easy would that be to do, a sectioning? I mean, would I have to be involved at all or could I just give you the house number and assure you that she is completely mental?"
715,715,2,Mark,False,5,They're putting me through somewhere.
716,716,2,Mark,False,16,"Hi, Soph, me again. Really, I'm leaving a lot of messages for you today, I know."
717,717,2,Mark,False,41,"Seriously, it's fine not calling back. Hope it's not 'cause I hung up in the middle of our, you know, thing. But really do please call me back. All my warmest wishes, Mark. Ridiculous sign-off, not sending her a birthday card."
718,718,2,Mark,False,23,"Six calls, nothing back. I wasn't gonna call again, but then I thought, Merry being sectioned, a nugget of sad but interesting news."
719,719,2,Mark,False,1,Hmm.
720,720,2,Mark,False,5,"What? No, of course not!"
721,721,2,Mark,False,12,"Jeremy, Super Hans is here! Did you try and get him sectioned?"
722,722,2,Mark,False,3,Of course not.
723,723,2,Mark,True,55,"Incredible, still no call from Soph. If she's broken up with me, maybe I suppose I could consider Merry. Would sort of suit me to have a girlfriend in an institution, regulated meeting times. I might get to have a say in her medication. I'd like to be able to chemically alter my girlfriend's moods."
724,724,2,Mark,True,9,At least she isn't proposing sexual intercourse any more.
725,725,2,Mark,True,21,Probably stopped fancying me now the sedatives have kicked in and she's lost the beer goggles. Normal service has been resumed.
726,726,2,Mark,False,6,"She's not fine, she's temporarily mad."
727,727,2,Mark,False,14,"I'm sorry about this, it's the 60s. He thinks he's living in the 60s."
728,728,2,Mark,False,15,"Look, Merry wanted me to give you these deeds. I'm not sure why or what-"
729,729,2,Mark,False,9,"So, Jez, what- why is she giving you these?"
730,730,2,Mark,False,18,"What? The deeds to the pub? Of course they're important. In fact, why do you even need them?"
731,731,2,Mark,False,5,She gave it to you?
732,732,2,Mark,False,11,"But that's... obviously, I mean, she's not in her right mind."
733,733,2,Mark,False,32,"Well, are you sure, 'cause I guess giving away a pub that's worth several thousands of pounds for free, that kind of suggests you haven't exactly got your best thinking cap on."
734,734,2,Mark,False,20,"Look, I just think, in this situation, Merry needs an impartial adviser like me to help her decide what's best."
735,735,2,Mark,False,9,"Oh God, that is low. That is really nuts."
736,736,2,Mark,False,20,"Look, I just think the best thing is if I hand these to the authorities here and let them decide."
737,737,2,Mark,False,13,"Hi there, Doctor. Listen, I just wondered if you could take care of-"
738,738,2,Mark,False,2,Get off!
739,739,2,Mark,False,7,What? I'm not out of my mind!
740,740,2,Mark,False,8,I just need to give you some documents!
741,741,2,Mark,False,3,I really don't.
742,742,2,Mark,False,3,"Jeremy, tell him."
743,743,2,Mark,False,25,"Jeremy! Are you...? Look, if there's anyone who's going nuts here, it's not me, it's you! They could section you for trying to section me!"
744,744,2,Mark,True,5,"OK, act shocked, act shocked."
745,745,2,Mark,False,2,"God, Sophie!"
746,746,2,Mark,False,36,"This is so weird! I'm just on my way to Oxford for a training day at the Institute of Finance. You must be, what, changing here on your way from Bristol to the Birmingham rep seminar?"
747,747,2,Mark,True,7,"God, she almost seems to believe me"
748,748,2,Mark,False,27,"So why haven't you called? You haven't called for over a week. Seeing you here by chance, I might as well find out why you haven't called."
749,749,2,Mark,False,1,What?
750,750,2,Mark,False,4,Merry? You think... Merry?
751,751,2,Mark,False,24,"Look, Merry's nuts, Sophie. She's mentally ill. She's been incarcerated. She stayed one night, then the white van came and they took her away."
752,752,2,Mark,False,15,"Soph, look at me. Honestly, she's in hospital. I can give you her reference number."
753,753,2,Mark,False,7,"You haven't done anything, have you Soph?"
754,754,2,Mark,False,2,Not really?
755,755,2,Mark,False,12,Nothing happened really.' The three least comforting words in the English language.
756,756,3,Mark,True,37,"Urgh feel awful. Still, made excellent time. Great bus driver. Same old route though. I should probably alter it occasionally, evade kidnappers. Not much of a risk, but I'd feel such an ass if it did happen."
757,757,3,Mark,True,27,Why is he so happy? I suppose I'd be happy if I'd just spent the whole day practising my signature and measuring my knob with dental floss.
758,758,3,Mark,False,14,"I'm ill. Gastric flu. It's been going round the office, funny tummy, weird ears."
759,759,3,Mark,False,61,"Yeah well, I'm not going all the way to Frankfurt puking and shitting just to be Tom Finnemore's bitch. Found out when I got in this morning, I'm just going to be cueing up his laptop. Went out to get some remedies, and I thought, ""Bollocks to this."" Just got to let Johnson know. How ill do you think I sound?"
760,760,3,Mark,False,3,What about now?
761,761,3,Mark,False,13,"Bollocks, he's been on voicemail all morning. Shall I just leave a message?"
762,762,3,Mark,False,1,No.
763,763,3,Mark,False,17,I don't want to go to the ball. I just want to sit around in my pants.
764,764,3,Mark,False,2,What the-
765,765,3,Mark,False,5,"No! No, I bloody won't!"
766,766,3,Mark,False,7,What- Jeremy! How did you allow this?
767,767,3,Mark,False,3,Didn't know what?
768,768,3,Mark,False,9,You let Super Hans use my bed for filth.
769,769,3,Mark,False,21,"Well, where in our massive duplex did you think they'd be? In one of the guest suites, or the billiard room?"
770,770,3,Mark,True,17,"Nice big lock. Maybe locks and walls aren't cool, but they worked for Hadrian and Ariel Sharon."
771,771,3,Mark,False,7,What the hell do you call that?
772,772,3,Mark,False,3,No it's not.
773,773,3,Mark,False,43,"It can't be a short-term solution, it doesn't even reach the floor. Look, Jeremy, I know for you doing your business in public is probably some sort of dream come true, but I can't live like that. You need to sort this out."
774,774,3,Mark,False,5,I'm not going to Frankfurt.
775,775,3,Mark,True,50,"He's never gonna do it. Where am I gonna poo? Can't go to Sophie, she's in Bristol. I'll have to go to the pub. They'll start to think I'm a junkie. I could offer them 50p a poo. Too weird. No, buy a pint each time, just become an alcoholic."
776,776,3,Mark,False,6,"All right, I'll bloody do it."
777,777,3,Mark,True,32,"What the hell is he laughing with the carpenter about? You have to maintain the barrier, or they'll re-tune your radio to a commercial station, and force you to borrow their pornography."
778,778,3,Mark,False,16,"No. What were you laughing about? What's he doing, how much is it going to cost?"
779,779,3,Mark,False,9,"Don't give me mottoes, Jeremy, I want figures, data."
780,780,3,Mark,False,13,Well I mean... do we... is that included within the rate as agreed?
781,781,3,Mark,False,14,How did we manage to get the one carpenter in Britain with a therapist?
782,782,3,Mark,False,8,"Yeah, but on my time? Jeremy, shouldn't you-"
783,783,3,Mark,False,5,"Right, thanks. Crisps and beans."
784,784,3,Mark,True,7,"What will come first, scurvy or rickets?"
785,785,3,Mark,False,11,It's Johnson. I don't sound ill enough. Will you take it?
786,786,3,Mark,False,4,Finnemore's got gastric flu?
787,787,3,Mark,False,8,Oh my God. Me? What shall I say?
788,788,3,Mark,False,6,"But I'm ill, I'm really ill."
789,789,3,Mark,False,25,"OK, OK, tell him I'm up for it. Don't tell him I'm ill. Say I've been working from home. Just tell him I'm coming in."
790,790,3,Mark,False,3,I'm a man!
791,791,3,Mark,False,8,"Whatever, Jeremy, let's not quibble. I'm a man!"
792,792,3,Mark,True,9,Jez comes good sometimes. He's not a total arsehole.
793,793,3,Mark,True,36,"A smiley face from Sophie. That's all I get? A template for a three-screen text about team leading in Frankfurt, my best news of the decade? I sent her flowers when she got a new fridge."
794,794,3,Mark,True,29,"Oh my God, I feel terrible. Glands in my neck like a couple of golf balls. I've got to look interested, keep nodding, nodding, and a bit of eyebrows."
795,795,3,Mark,False,4,"Oh, yeah, great. Absolutely."
796,796,3,Mark,True,23,"Maybe I can just get some rest if I get my hand so it looks like I'm concentrating, but actually, grab some micro-sleep."
797,797,3,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh?
798,798,3,Mark,False,11,"Yes, no, no. No she isn't. But good joke there, mate."
799,799,3,Mark,True,11,"When was the last time Sophie texted you a template, fuckface?"
800,800,3,Mark,True,15,I can sleep on the plane. I can sleep on the plane. I can sleep...
801,801,3,Mark,False,2,"Right, great."
802,802,3,Mark,True,23,"I can go to the little loo, put my jacket on the seat like a cushion, and make out I got locked in."
803,803,3,Mark,False,3,So we'd better...
804,804,3,Mark,True,6,"don't say brainstorm, don't say brainstorm."
805,805,3,Mark,True,6,God bless those over-unionised European economies.
806,806,3,Mark,False,33,"Plane cancelled. Next one's seven in the morning. Had a nap in the taxi, but I want to get some more sleep before- what the hell have you done to this place, Jeremy?"
807,807,3,Mark,False,20,"Well, for one thing, it's a fire hazard. You've never worried about the vibe in here before. What's going on?"
808,808,3,Mark,False,1,Jeremy.
809,809,3,Mark,False,2,Magic mushrooms?
810,810,3,Mark,False,3,Isn't really there.
811,811,3,Mark,False,6,The stuff that is really there.
812,812,3,Mark,False,16,"Look, Jez, I just don't feel comfortable about you having a drugs party in my flat."
813,813,3,Mark,False,3,That's your plan?
814,814,3,Mark,False,5,Why? Because I'm an embarrassment?
815,815,3,Mark,False,38,No. It's my flat and I feel ill. I just want to lounge around in my pants and watch Judge John Deed. Can't you and your friends cope with the sight of me lounging around in my pants?
816,816,3,Mark,False,7,"Well, then, you'd better tell him yourself."
817,817,3,Mark,False,7,"I don't mind, it's fine by me."
818,818,3,Mark,False,44,"All right, I'm going for a power nap. I'll be back out later to look at these training videos, so I'll need the living room. But if you must trip, you can trip in here, in your room and a bit in the hall."
819,819,3,Mark,False,2,Cheers mate.
820,820,3,Mark,False,2,"Oh, thanks."
821,821,3,Mark,False,4,"OK, thanks. I will."
822,822,3,Mark,False,1,Thanks.
823,823,3,Mark,True,109,"Urgh I feel terrible. I feel like someone's trying to deliver the whole of the Sunday Times into my head. Sophie can't even be bothered to send me templates any more. Just go to the loo and then... What? He's... has he... locked me in?! This is incredible! This is literally unbelievable! I'm locked out of a party that's happening in my own home! It's Sarah's eighteenth all over again. A mushroom party in my flat is not in the bloody tenant's agreement! Of course, I never made him sign a tenant's agreement. Bollocks. This is the last friendship I have that's not backed up by a legally-enforceable document."
824,824,3,Mark,False,2,Jeremy! Jeremy!!
825,825,3,Mark,False,7,"Open up! Open up, you bloody arsehole!"
826,826,3,Mark,False,6,You bloody- I can't believe you!
827,827,3,Mark,False,7,Let me out! I need a poo!
828,828,3,Mark,True,113,"Oh, God. Can I do this? If I do this, even if I end up marrying Sophie and we live in a detached house in Surrey, and buy a holiday home in Umbria, our children will always look up at the face of a man who once crapped in a takeaway bag. Plus, I'd have to hide it here somewhere in my room next to one of my... things. I could throw it out the window. No, that's what they want you to do. That's where society's headed! People shitting in bags and throwing them out the window at each other. Well, I'm not going to be the first! Not in my name!"
829,829,3,Mark,False,1,Jeremy!
830,830,3,Mark,False,1,Johnson!
831,831,3,Mark,False,1,Johnson!
832,832,3,Mark,False,6,"Oh thank you, Alan! Thank you!"
833,833,3,Mark,False,7,"As for you Jeremy, you bloody shit!"
834,834,3,Mark,False,7,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Alan."
835,835,3,Mark,False,16,"Yep, I'm fine, great. Just, the door fell out and we haven't... so... I need to..."
836,836,3,Mark,False,3,"Yep, oh yeah."
837,837,3,Mark,False,3,"It is, honestly."
838,838,3,Mark,False,2,"Please, Alan."
839,839,3,Mark,False,2,No but...
840,840,3,Mark,False,6,"I'm sorry, I'm just so sorry."
841,841,3,Mark,False,4,"Jeremy, for God's sake."
842,842,4,Mark,True,69,"Yeah, fuck you. Shit, five hours on Blitzkrieg. This isn't how it was meant to be. Week's holiday? I was going to get to grips with the Roman Republic, get into the GI diet. Can't stop now, got to win the war for the Nazis. Am I enjoying this? Don't know any more, doesn't matter. Got to finish the level. Then read those, do some sit-ups, learn the clarinet."
843,843,4,Mark,False,2,My sister?
844,844,4,Mark,False,16,"Do you mean the pizza coupon with, ""Szs mzzc"" question mark written with a burnt match?"
845,845,4,Mark,False,10,"What?! Hold on, Sarah's broken up with Simon? That's terrible."
846,846,4,Mark,True,19,"I'll never get my iPod speakers back now. Still, on the bright side the bass response was pretty awful."
847,847,4,Mark,False,6,"So, Sarah, great to see you."
848,848,4,Mark,False,8,Really? You seen they have jumbo cashews now?
849,849,4,Mark,False,15,"Oh, yeah. Of course, I was happy enough with the normal size but nothing lasts."
850,850,4,Mark,True,24,Why do the people who want to talk about things always win? Why can't the people who don't want to talk about things win?
851,851,4,Mark,True,15,"Oh my God, he's doing it. His routine. He's doing his routine on my sister."
852,852,4,Mark,True,7,"She's laughing, she's laughing at his jokes."
853,853,4,Mark,False,31,"Yeah, it's great Jeremy, getting everything out in the open, isn't it? Have you told Sarah how you're married and you've got chlamydia and you're still in love with Big Suze?"
854,854,4,Mark,False,8,I see you. I know what you're doing.
855,855,4,Mark,False,16,You're gonna try and sleep with her aren't you? I can see it in your eyes.
856,856,4,Mark,False,10,Promise me you will not try to sleep with her.
857,857,4,Mark,False,7,"So, you slept with her. You promised."
858,858,4,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, well you didn't try very hard did you?"
859,859,4,Mark,True,15,They're rubbing it in my face. It's like I've got his member in my face.
860,860,4,Mark,False,22,"Nothing means anything to you does it? Friendship. Loyalty. They're just fusty old words like ""sixpence"" and ""codpiece"" to you aren't they?"
861,861,4,Mark,False,6,She's in a vulnerable state Jeremy.
862,862,4,Mark,False,36,"Argh! Don't say that. I know what you do with the... electric toothbrush, and the, the... bum stuff. Oh my God, I can't believe I'm even thinking about it. Couldn't you find anyone else to shag?"
863,863,4,Mark,False,14,You'll say anything won't you? Words don't mean a thing to you do they?
864,864,4,Mark,False,10,"No, I guess not. It's just... I don't believe you."
865,865,4,Mark,True,43,"If I don't pay it's OK. If I don't pay it's OK. Oh God. Four hours of my precious holiday wasted. Face it, the day's a write-off. Might as well just carry on. Must be something to puncture my thickening shield of numbness."
866,866,4,Mark,False,3,Just a minute!
867,867,4,Mark,True,32,"This is fine, there's nothing to be embarrassed about nowadays, looking at porn's just like lying to Parliament. It used to be wrong but now it's just a great big funny joke."
868,868,4,Mark,False,2,Big Suze?
869,869,4,Mark,False,15,"No, Jez is- he's not here. He's with my sister. They've started going out actually."
870,870,4,Mark,False,4,What are the lines?
871,871,4,Mark,True,14,"God, she's beautiful. How did Jeremy ever- I guess she's just a bit stupid."
872,872,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh, no, just a bit of internet research."
873,873,4,Mark,True,8,"My God, she's not stupid, she's incredibly perceptive."
874,874,4,Mark,False,34,"No, God no. Nothing like that. I wish. No, historical. Sophie wouldn't want to know about boring old history. I'll actually turn that off. I was just heading out, salad and a Hawksmoor Church."
875,875,4,Mark,True,25,"God, she's so posh that I, Mark Corrigan, who was privately educated until dad's British Aerospace shares went kaput, could be her bit of rough."
876,876,4,Mark,False,19,"Listen, I mean, if you want... I mean, you probably don't want to, but you'd be very welcome to-"
877,877,4,Mark,False,24,I know. They're probably just waiting for the last few Christians to die out and then they'll convert it into a prestige living space.
878,878,4,Mark,True,45,"Oh God, she's just so incredibly lovely. She's probably got a title, she's just too modest to say. Lady Big Suze and Lord Mark. No, don't get ahead of yourself, just focus on trying to lean her towards ecclesiastical architecture and away from disco dancing.)"
879,879,4,Mark,False,12,"But watch out though, I'm on your tail. I'm Hawksmoor, you're Wren."
880,880,4,Mark,True,21,"Oh my God, I've fallen in love with her. But of course, brilliant, how incredibly predictable. What a total fucking dope."
881,881,4,Mark,True,64,"Ah, this is the life. I'm eating over the five fruit and veg a day. Managed to cut Jeremy down to one. He still thinks potatoes count, the arsehole. I'm winning, I'm not gonna get cancer and he is. I mean, I don't want him to. But if one of us is gonna get it, which we obviously are, I'd rather it was him."
882,882,4,Mark,False,9,"Thanks, and you're back from work. How is work?"
883,883,4,Mark,False,14,"Oh, she's just emailing her agent about the play. Mmm, that is tickety boo."
884,884,4,Mark,False,26,"Oh yeah, we just popped to the British Museum and then to the IMAX to watch a 3D film about the Rolling Stones. Block of fudge?"
885,885,4,Mark,False,8,"What? My God Jeremy, of course not, no."
886,886,4,Mark,False,26,"Normally when people are in love and sharing a bed contrary to all prior arrangements, they like to shout it from the highest mountain, et cetera."
887,887,4,Mark,True,2,Potato. Perfect.
888,888,4,Mark,False,5,"Oh, that's fine, don't worry."
889,889,4,Mark,False,4,What? No I'm not.
890,890,4,Mark,False,8,"No, it's just I have a paper copy."
891,891,4,Mark,False,24,"Jeremy I am not in love with her. Anyway, how come you even care about Suze if you're so in love with my sister?"
892,892,4,Mark,False,10,"Well, you seem pretty angry for someone who's just interested."
893,893,4,Mark,True,24,"Oh yes, the healthy life. Haven't surfed for filth for days and I've almost forgotten the images that are seared into my brain forever."
894,894,4,Mark,False,16,"Well, if it all gets too much for you, you can always crash at my place."
895,895,4,Mark,True,108,"Oh yeah, I'm ready. Ready to watch your lovely bottom before I have a heart attack. Hey, wow, I'm actually good at this. Maybe I'm a natural. Yeah, I'm a jogger. Of course, there had to be a sport for me. I just never realised. I'm a natural jogger. Feel the legs like two great steam locomotives pumping away. I'm Cram, I'm Ovett, I'm unstoppable. I'm- Jesus, is that a stitch? I- fuck, I think I'm gonna be sick. I've gotta... slow. I need to... walk. Oh, I think I'm gonna puke. I'm literally gonna die. What an idiotic boob I was about ten or eleven seconds ago."
896,896,4,Mark,False,13,"Oh no, it's fine. I don't have a style, really, so no cramping."
897,897,4,Mark,True,33,"Don't get excited. Just lie on the floor at her feet like the faithful dog I am. I will protect you Big Suze. If any intruders come I will attack, I will bite."
898,898,4,Mark,False,4,I don't think... really?
899,899,4,Mark,False,1,Great.
900,900,4,Mark,True,14,Maybe something could happen. In the same bed... human nature might take its course.
901,901,4,Mark,False,4,Yes I suppose so.
902,902,4,Mark,True,23,"I know what I'll do, I'll wait until she's asleep and then touch her hair. Just as much hair touching as I like."
903,903,4,Mark,False,8,Steady on. My mushroom stroganoff isn't that bad.
904,904,4,Mark,False,30,"Oh, no, I'm sure we can work it out. It would be a shame to break up the lovebirds. Unless, I mean, you do want her to stay don't you?"
905,905,4,Mark,False,13,"Then you're just gonna have to take responsibility for your actions, for once."
906,906,4,Mark,False,21,"Oh that's nice. That's a nice thing to say. So, what is it especially that you, you know, love about her?"
907,907,4,Mark,False,15,"Oh come on, I mean, is she the one? Do you think it will last?"
908,908,4,Mark,False,8,"He's bashful. But, I see brother-in-law material there."
909,909,4,Mark,False,6,"Jeremy, I think your girlfriend's crying."
910,910,4,Mark,False,5,That was definitely sobbing Jez.
911,911,4,Mark,False,51,"Yeah, well, even if it is family stuff, frankly I don't wanna know about all the infidelities and heartache. And, you know, if Uncle Lance was touched up by the vicar and that's why he's such a tit at Christmas. Well, I'm sorry but I just don't wanna hear about it."
912,912,4,Mark,False,8,What are you dancing a jig for Jeremy?
913,913,4,Mark,False,3,Where's Sarah gone?
914,914,4,Mark,False,14,You're loving this aren't you? This has worked out perfectly for you hasn't it?
915,915,4,Mark,False,15,"Oh come on Jez, this is me you're talking to. There's no need to pretend."
916,916,4,Mark,False,46,"What? What do you? Look, Jez, all right. The fact is she is a beautiful woman. That's just a fact. A blind man could see that. But, I mean, I'm not gonna do anything. I'm just like a kind of blind eunuch looking at a painting."
917,917,4,Mark,True,8,My carefully nurtured public image succeeds once again.
918,918,4,Mark,True,11,"Brilliant, total lack of self control. Drunk himself out of contention."
919,919,4,Mark,False,13,"Just very, very upset about Sarah. I think they really had a bond."
920,920,4,Mark,False,4,"Suze, are you OK?"
921,921,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh yeah, I know. They're great aren't they?"
922,922,4,Mark,True,14,"Here we go. My God, I'm gonna have to learn to ride a horse."
923,923,4,Mark,False,1,Jez...
924,924,4,Mark,False,11,"What? No, of course I haven't. She was telling me about-"
925,925,4,Mark,False,4,"No, don't be ridiculous."
926,926,4,Mark,False,1,No!
927,927,4,Mark,False,15,No and even if it was it wouldn't prove love. It's just a human body.
928,928,4,Mark,True,12,"This is it, go for it. Tell her. Betray Sophie. Destroy Jeremy."
929,929,4,Mark,False,11,"No. God no. As you know, I'm in love with Sophie."
930,930,4,Mark,False,69,"Honestly Suze. I like you, sort of, but not even really that much. I mean, you're very, you know, horsey. You're the horsey type. Not that I've got a chip on my shoulder. But, you know, you're sort of a throwback. A kind of Marie Antoinette figure. Let them eat cake. Not that she ever said that, it's a mis-translation. But, you know, big stupid posh head, that's you."
931,931,4,Mark,False,3,"Well, happy now?"
932,932,4,Mark,False,17,"No way, absolutely not. I'm not letting you leave. You've got to face up to your responsibilities!"
933,933,4,Mark,False,3,"Jeremy, you bloody-"
934,934,4,Mark,False,35,"Oh Sarah, I... Blimey. Look, the thing is... Look, it's really not my responsibility to tell you this. Jeremy's gone, all right? He's pissed off. He's left. And I'm not gonna do his dirty work."
935,935,4,Mark,False,17,"Well he- the dickhead, he wanted me to dump you for him, if you can imagine that."
936,936,4,Mark,True,22,I should just be honest. I owe her that at least. Just tell her he fucked her and now he's chucked her.
937,937,4,Mark,False,10,"Look, it's not you it's him. He has commitment issues."
938,938,4,Mark,False,3,I'm really not.
939,939,4,Mark,False,24,I really don't. And if you could stop the talking for just one minute then maybe Jeremy and Simon wouldn't keep on dumping you.
940,940,4,Mark,True,35,"Great. OK, so I've dumped my sister. That's great. That feels good. I'm intrigued to see what I'm gonna do next. Maybe I'll ring up Granddad and tell him I think he's a boring twat."
941,941,5,Mark,False,12,"Another hard day, eh, Jez? Watching kids' TV and eating kids' cereal?"
942,942,5,Mark,False,13,"Yeah well, Frosties are just Corn Flakes for people who can't face reality."
943,943,5,Mark,False,28,"She's been very very busy, far too busy for post. Don't think she'll actually be coming down over the weekend. She wants to it's just there's this thing."
944,944,5,Mark,False,13,"What am I gonna do, Jez? Feels like she's slipping through my fingers."
945,945,5,Mark,False,15,"Are you kidding? That's like firing first in a duel. If you miss, you're fucked."
946,946,5,Mark,False,6,Doesn't that devalue it a bit?
947,947,5,Mark,False,7,Aren't you going to open your post?
948,948,5,Mark,False,10,"Jeremy, That one's On Her Majesty's Service, for God's sake."
949,949,5,Mark,False,21,Jury service? You've been called up for jury service? I can't believe they'd choose you! Must be some kind of mistake.
950,950,5,Mark,False,23,"Well, because your... critical facult- I'm not being rude, but you'd be the first to admit that you're not a very logical thinker."
951,951,5,Mark,False,12,"You still don't properly understand what happens in Ocean's Eleven, do you?"
952,952,5,Mark,False,3,It really isn't.
953,953,5,Mark,False,6,"Jeremy, Don't try and upset me."
954,954,5,Mark,False,11,Don't you think you should wait till you hear the details?
955,955,5,Mark,False,2,"Nice, yes."
956,956,5,Mark,False,1,Really?
957,957,5,Mark,True,16,"If she gets fired and everything goes wrong, I'll be there to pick up the pieces."
958,958,5,Mark,False,3,"Oh, OK, sure."
959,959,5,Mark,True,27,"Bollocks. Could be a difficult call. It might be good. Tell her I love her, then before it gets too soppy, hit her with the disciplinary matters."
960,960,5,Mark,False,9,"Jez! So, first day in court, tell me everything."
961,961,5,Mark,False,24,"I could get us a fried chicken bucket for dinner. And from a properly franchised outlet, not the one that gave you that fever."
962,962,5,Mark,False,12,"Credit card fraud?! Nescliffe?! A woman?! Oh, my God, this is incredible!"
963,963,5,Mark,False,9,Why? Has she taken the stand? What's her alibi?
964,964,5,Mark,False,1,Shifty?
965,965,5,Mark,False,7,I thought you were going to acquit.
966,966,5,Mark,False,22,No smoke without fire?! Is that what a thousand years of the English judicial system comes down to? No smoke without fire?!
967,967,5,Mark,True,36,"Ah, soup. Lovely hug in a mug. All I need now is a kiss in a tube. A wank in a packet. Better call Sophie. Or maybe, just before, play solitaire for three or four hours."
968,968,5,Mark,True,3,"Shit, it's her!"
969,969,5,Mark,False,2,"Hello, Sophie?"
970,970,5,Mark,False,2,Are you?
971,971,5,Mark,False,14,"Of course, I- I miss you too. Although, tonight, you do know it's Thursday?"
972,972,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, OK."
973,973,5,Mark,True,7,"Johnson's right, she's dangerously out of control."
974,974,5,Mark,False,2,Brilliant. Bye.
975,975,5,Mark,True,35,Shit. Bottled it. Tell her tonight after chicken and wine and Sara Lee. Maybe I could get some chocolate-flavour condoms. I might be more relaxed if we both regarded my penis as a novelty item.
976,976,5,Mark,True,35,"Oh what a night. We'll eat and laugh and I'll make out I think Colin Cooper's a dickhead too, when actually he's doing bloody good work with a difficult team and some very testing targets."
977,977,5,Mark,False,2,What's funny?
978,978,5,Mark,False,8,Is it something to do with the case?
979,979,5,Mark,False,4,Yeah. What's going on?
980,980,5,Mark,False,14,Did the uncle show up? They haven't found the missing security tapes from Ryman's?
981,981,5,Mark,False,8,"Is she? Why, what came out? What happened?"
982,982,5,Mark,False,7,You got to know her a bit?
983,983,5,Mark,False,16,"For God's sake Jeremy, you're not supposed to speak to the defendant, it's against the law."
984,984,5,Mark,False,25,"Jeremy, you've got to break this off. You've got to tell her to stop texting you and that you can't meet up for a drink."
985,985,5,Mark,False,23,"Well, I suppose people might think it would make you less impartial if you're trying to bone the woman you're meant to judging."
986,986,5,Mark,False,5,Jez. it's contempt of court.
987,987,5,Mark,False,11,"Oh, that's a great law isn't it! What's that, Gaddafi's law?"
988,988,5,Mark,True,4,Sophie! The Sophster! Sophistry!
989,989,5,Mark,False,5,Soph! Great to see you.
990,990,5,Mark,False,7,"Hi, Dom. Really great to meet you."
991,991,5,Mark,True,20,"Oh great, Dom. And I suppose Dom's gonna have sex with Sophie while I film it on my camera phone."
992,992,5,Mark,True,29,"He's gay! He's obviously gay. My God, I actually have gaydar. Is he going? I hope he's going. Shutting the door might be a bit aggressive if he's not."
993,993,5,Mark,False,6,"Oh, good, thanks. You look great."
994,994,5,Mark,True,9,Juice bar? Massage? Orgasm?! That's everything I stand against!
995,995,5,Mark,False,22,"Er, well, that sounds great, it's just I've made chicken, I've got wine. I've got DVDs. Ocean's Twelve and Meet The Fockers."
996,996,5,Mark,False,13,"Yeah well It's sort of like a reminiscipackage. Plus there's commentaries, outtakes... bloopers."
997,997,5,Mark,False,17,"Er, well, I guess I'd hate to be responsible for someone actually throwing up, so yeah, great."
998,998,5,Mark,True,18,"You win this one, Sophie, but I will have my revenge. All day at the National Maritime Museum."
999,999,5,Mark,True,19,"One cocktail. That was the arrangement. One cocktail, then home. Not four cocktails and off to a gay club."
1000,1000,5,Mark,True,21,"Great. Trapped all night with the homos and the criminals. Like prison, but without even the privacy of my own cell."
1001,1001,5,Mark,False,1,What?!
1002,1002,5,Mark,True,5,"Lie. Say yes, say yes."
1003,1003,5,Mark,False,49,"No. No, I'm not. God, sorry. I mean I did once have this thing with a- I had these feelings, but it was complicated. It was more a sort of atmosphere, nothing ever really- I mean sexuality's a sort of a spectrum isn't it, rather than a black and-"
1004,1004,5,Mark,False,14,"Thanks, great. There are a lot of gay guys in there tonight? Great. Brilliant."
1005,1005,5,Mark,True,25,"God, how did I end up here? And will I ever be allowed to leave? Just got to ride the waves of alienation and self-loathing."
1006,1006,5,Mark,False,3,"Oh, yeah, wicked."
1007,1007,5,Mark,True,25,And apparently I'm just a stick in the mud for thinking their breaking the law is anything other than one of those brilliant urban jokes.
1008,1008,5,Mark,False,14,"Jez, if I need the bog, this place, its official classification is ""gay-friendly"" yeah?"
1009,1009,5,Mark,False,22,"Does that mean friendly gays, or friendly to the gays? 'Cause, to be honest, friendly gays sound not worse, but, you know..."
1010,1010,5,Mark,False,6,People... men have looked at me.
1011,1011,5,Mark,False,7,Er well I'm not really sure I'd-
1012,1012,5,Mark,False,11,Is there not even a slim chance that I might die?
1013,1013,5,Mark,False,4,Yes. Of course. Sure.
1014,1014,5,Mark,True,28,"So a candle stuck in a wine bottle apparently doesn't cut it any more. Now for a special night, you have to have class A drugs and... fisting."
1015,1015,5,Mark,True,25,"She's proud of me? For taking a little white pill of drugs? But probably if I'd fought at Goose Green, she wouldn't want to know."
1016,1016,5,Mark,True,21,You are gonna have an amazing night. I am going to have a perfectly ordinary night. Right under your stupid nose.
1017,1017,5,Mark,False,31,"Right yeah Jez, listen, the thing is, I didn't actually pop my pill. I'm pretending. In fact mate, I could do with a few pointers on how to be a druggie."
1018,1018,5,Mark,False,19,Because I don't want to wake up dribbling in a phone box with a trucker's penis in my ear!
1019,1019,5,Mark,False,29,"But tonight, all that crap you talk when you're off your noggin, I never really listen. What do you prattle on about? And how should I say I'm feeling?"
1020,1020,5,Mark,False,2,"OK, thanks."
1021,1021,5,Mark,False,5,"Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm feeling..."
1022,1022,5,Mark,False,18,"No, no, no, it's good, everything's gone sort of bubbly. It's like I'm trapped inside a giant Aero."
1023,1023,5,Mark,False,16,"And, and do you know what, I also think I might be getting the famous munchies."
1024,1024,5,Mark,False,3,"Oh, right, yeah!"
1025,1025,5,Mark,False,4,Take- taking it up.
1026,1026,5,Mark,False,3,Taking it up.
1027,1027,5,Mark,True,6,This guy is literally a moron.
1028,1028,5,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1029,1029,5,Mark,True,8,"Oh, God, the sweaty grip of the moron."
1030,1030,5,Mark,False,7,"Yep, yeah I can still feel it."
1031,1031,5,Mark,True,54,"Oh, God, I'm so tired. How did my house become a rave? This is probably how a squat starts. They'll never leave, and eventually they'll brick me up in my room and ownership will pass to them because a high court judge will rule me to be officially ""not living life to the max."""
1032,1032,5,Mark,False,15,"Soph, it's lovely, your incessant rubbing of my back, but it is starting to chafe."
1033,1033,5,Mark,False,5,The wine! The wine's been-
1034,1034,5,Mark,True,3,"Shit, too rational."
1035,1035,5,Mark,False,33,"Oh, yeah yeah, I'm fine. I just... I love being down here on the carpet with the stain. Look at the pattern it's making as it soaks into my genuine, pure wool carpet."
1036,1036,5,Mark,True,21,"Look at these drop-outs. They think they're having fun. If we were agricultural workers, the day would already be half gone."
1037,1037,5,Mark,False,5,"Are you all right, Soph?"
1038,1038,5,Mark,False,24,"OK. OK. What you need is some peace and quiet, and some rest. And a cup of tea and some toast with peanut butter."
1039,1039,5,Mark,False,12,She's going to bed. She doesn't want any more of your drugs.
1040,1040,5,Mark,False,19,"You just have a nice lie-down there Soph. I'll bring the tea and toast through in a minute, OK?"
1041,1041,5,Mark,False,44,"Right, OK that's it, turn the music down. You can stop smoking your drugs. I'm making tea and toast for Sophie. I'm putting on Radio 4. Everything's normal. I'm not really high on drugs, so you can stop talking your nonsense on my time."
1042,1042,5,Mark,False,12,"No, you can't. You've been chilling long enough. This is reality calling."
1043,1043,5,Mark,False,33,"There is no bond. You're not a bad person, but I'm afraid to say you are a moron. Now pull your socks up and get your shoes on. Come on, all of you."
1044,1044,5,Mark,False,74,"Listen, while we're at it, there are systems for a reason in this world. Economic stability, interest rates, growth. It's not all a conspiracy to keep you in little boxes. All right? It's only the miracle of consumer capitalism that means you're not lying in your own shit, dying at forty-three with rotten teeth, and a little pill with a chicken on it is not going to change that. Now come on. Fuck off!"
1045,1045,5,Mark,False,22,"Shit, yeah, I know how you feel like a big sort of coconut with a brain inside it. Whoops. Sorry, I'd better..."
1046,1046,5,Mark,False,1,Hello?
1047,1047,5,Mark,False,1,OK.
1048,1048,5,Mark,True,11,"Come on, Mark, do it. You're Sugar, you're Trump, you're Rommel."
1049,1049,5,Mark,False,12,"I- Thanks. Soph Before you go, there's something I need to say."
1050,1050,5,Mark,False,14,It's just well... you've- you've really got to pull your socks up at work.
1051,1051,5,Mark,False,12,"You've got to stop pulling sickies and screwing around, Sophie. Johnson says."
1052,1052,5,Mark,False,24,"No, no Sophie it's just, if you want to be a major player, you've got to apply yourself more and be more punctual. Hug?"
1053,1053,5,Mark,True,16,"We'll laugh about this. Definitely. Unless it kills the relationship stone dead, which it probably will."
1054,1054,6,Mark,False,9,So I think I'm definitely gonna propose to Sophie.
1055,1055,6,Mark,False,21,"Exactly, she's in Bristol, we hardly ever see each other and when we do we argue. She's slipping through my fingers."
1056,1056,6,Mark,False,12,I need to make a statement. Are you aiming for the bullseye?
1057,1057,6,Mark,False,3,No it isn't.
1058,1058,6,Mark,False,26,"I'm going to take her to a four-star hotel in Somerset, the Quantocks, and ask her to marry me. Now's the time, I must strike soon."
1059,1059,6,Mark,False,61,"Well not because the hotel mega deal vouchers from the Sunday Times expire at the end of the month, that doesn't enter into it. Another mega deal will come along in some national newspaper eventually and Mr Patel saves me the vouchers, in fact I've got enough for two bloody rooms, so if it all goes pear shaped I can always-"
1060,1060,6,Mark,False,1,No.
1061,1061,6,Mark,False,15,"Quantocks. No Jez, no, I'm gonna propose. Really this has to be a solo mission."
1062,1062,6,Mark,False,10,Look I suppose if you want you can ask her.
1063,1063,6,Mark,False,4,"No Jeremy, no way!"
1064,1064,6,Mark,False,11,Can't believe the restaurant didn't have a record of my booking.
1065,1065,6,Mark,False,13,"Well maybe we should have gone to the place with all, hanging plants."
1066,1066,6,Mark,False,20,Well I thought you didn't like it 'cause when we looked at the menu you kind of wrinkled your nose.
1067,1067,6,Mark,True,31,"She definitely did. Must maintain good relations. Can't propose in bad odour. Jesus, thirty-three percent of our mini-break weekend has already gone, everything's got to be perfect for the big moment."
1068,1068,6,Mark,False,4,"Well, what about here?"
1069,1069,6,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, sure."
1070,1070,6,Mark,True,19,"No, no, I don't know what your inexpressible criteria are. Why don't you tell me the secret fucking formula?"
1071,1071,6,Mark,False,30,"Oh, back? No no, we can't go back, we've gotta push on. Push on to Moscow. I'll just see if there- there might be something in one of the guides."
1072,1072,6,Mark,False,23,"Well I think there's probably a reason why no one goes to the places no one goes, they're overpriced and have poor service."
1073,1073,6,Mark,True,39,"Oh great, she's posted a book. And I suppose I'm supposed to find that incredibly charming and French. Well it's not, it's a waste of £8.99 but I've got to grin and take it 'cause it's the proposal weekend."
1074,1074,6,Mark,False,4,"So, this is nice."
1075,1075,6,Mark,True,54,"This isn't lovely, this is horrible. All the people's food looks awful. Our big engagement dinner in the Quantocks is gonna be terrible, I want to cry. Oh my God, we're not saying anything, we've got nothing to say, we've skipped twenty years, we're one of those couples you see. Gotta say something, anything!"
1076,1076,6,Mark,False,12,"So, what do you think of the... chairs? Quite... OK aren't they?"
1077,1077,6,Mark,True,17,"Spider senses tingling, there's something wrong with them. What is it? Booze? Drugs? Sex? Mental health issues?"
1078,1078,6,Mark,False,14,"Sophie, are you all right with this, because if you're not we can always-"
1079,1079,6,Mark,True,33,She goes looking for fun after just a minute of uncomfortable silence. Well you better get used to it honey because when we're married there'll be a lot more where that came from.
1080,1080,6,Mark,True,10,"Oh great, gynaecology, my favourite topic of conversation with strangers."
1081,1081,6,Mark,True,11,Gotta get her away from these freaks and pop the question.
1082,1082,6,Mark,False,7,"Soph, it's getting late, should we be-"
1083,1083,6,Mark,True,11,"Gotta get her on her own, get her to the bench."
1084,1084,6,Mark,False,14,"It's the Apprentice final tonight Soph, we can't miss that, we've got to go."
1085,1085,6,Mark,False,10,"Yes, but Sugar's got it in for the short guy."
1086,1086,6,Mark,True,35,"Oh bollocks, I'm gonna end up proposing on the M4, possibly the M25, how romantic will that be? And it's all gonna be her fault. Why won't that stupid bitch let me propose to her?"
1087,1087,6,Mark,True,69,"Argh that smarts! Horrible whisky. Still, midnight down the bar. Can't exactly have a chocolate milkshake, can I? Jesus, what am I going to do. I've got to ask her. Or, maybe just slope home, never mention it? Make Jeremy promise not to say jokes about it and- God I need someone to talk to, got to get my thoughts straight. Well, he's an idiot but he's my idiot."
1088,1088,6,Mark,False,1,Jeremy?
1089,1089,6,Mark,False,5,What are you doing here?
1090,1090,6,Mark,False,14,Why-? What are you doing sleeping here? Why aren't you in your hotel room?
1091,1091,6,Mark,False,23,"The maid, at midnight? What's going on Jeremy, what have you done to the room? You haven't abused the mega deal have you?"
1092,1092,6,Mark,False,16,Super Hans? Going cold turkey on my Sunday Times mega deal? Oh that is too rich!
1093,1093,6,Mark,False,29,"Sophie. Hey Sophie, you got bored of- OK, OK, don't panic, where are you? Well don't move, I'll be there any minute, OK? Everything's going to be fine, OK?"
1094,1094,6,Mark,False,39,"She went for a walk with these two idiots drinking sloe gin, now they've gone off and left her, she's scared and lost, I'm gonna go and find her. Argh, God, that's horrible. I could do with a hand."
1095,1095,6,Mark,False,9,She thought she might be near a big rock.
1096,1096,6,Mark,False,29,"That's what I was going to say, then I thought, you know, a bit more comforting and Des Lynam now, I can be all Jimmy Carr about it later."
1097,1097,6,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
1098,1098,6,Mark,False,1,No.
1099,1099,6,Mark,False,15,Well I wanted to talk some stuff through with someone didn't I? You big dick.
1100,1100,6,Mark,False,7,"No, one time that happened. It's her."
1101,1101,6,Mark,False,35,"Now Soph, I want you to remain calm but can you give me a description of the rock at all? Is it mossy for example- oh great. No no, that's fine. Sure, see you soon."
1102,1102,6,Mark,False,17,"She's back at the hotel, she found Gerrard and Isabelle about five minutes after she called us."
1103,1103,6,Mark,False,9,Well we're going down so that must be right.
1104,1104,6,Mark,False,29,Look we should just keep going we're bound to hit something soon. We should probably hurry 'cause Sophie said there might be a bit of a thunderstorm coming in.
1105,1105,6,Mark,False,23,"This isn't Matterhorn Jeremy, it's the Quantocks, nobody dies in the Quantocks. If we're very unlucky we might have wandered onto Exmoor but-"
1106,1106,6,Mark,False,1,Why?
1107,1107,6,Mark,False,1,No.
1108,1108,6,Mark,False,30,We're not calling Mountain Rescue. We're not gonna be two of those idiots you hear about who go up mountains in flip flops and sombreros and have to get rescued.
1109,1109,6,Mark,False,13,"You can't call Mountain Rescue anyway, this isn't a mountain, it's a hill."
1110,1110,6,Mark,False,9,"Will you please stop saying that. Ow, bollocks! Fuck!"
1111,1111,6,Mark,False,5,"Argh shit, my ankle! I've-"
1112,1112,6,Mark,False,2,"Err, no."
1113,1113,6,Mark,False,24,"No, mate, no, don't leave. 'Cause, and I'm not being rude, if you go you won't come back. You'll leave me here to die."
1114,1114,6,Mark,False,49,"Nobody is going to die- this is southern England, nobody dies in southern England Jeremy, that just doesn't happen, OK? Now, look, I haven't told you about this before but I actually have a bar of Dairy Milk with me. I think it's probably time we rationed it out."
1115,1115,6,Mark,False,13,"Well it's hardly worth starting the rationing once we've eaten it, is it?"
1116,1116,6,Mark,False,10,I just thought a block each every two hours and-
1117,1117,6,Mark,False,23,"Well, if you insist. There's seven segments, so that's three each with one left over, which is mine seeing as it's... all mine."
1118,1118,6,Mark,False,16,Just don't come to me asking for some more when you didn't have the foresight to-
1119,1119,6,Mark,False,1,No.
1120,1120,6,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy, I explained to you all that."
1121,1121,6,Mark,False,10,"Look, let's just concentrate on getting back to the hotel."
1122,1122,6,Mark,False,3,Don't mention it.
1123,1123,6,Mark,True,10,Always got the Twix. No need to mention the Twix.
1124,1124,6,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh.
1125,1125,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
1126,1126,6,Mark,False,21,Not doing it? But that's what this whole weekend's been about. I saved for three months for the mega deal vouchers.
1127,1127,6,Mark,False,22,"I don't know, I kind of assumed it was because I spend all my time thinking about it, I'm obsessed with it."
1128,1128,6,Mark,False,22,"Are you kidding? Everything. Her, you know... I mean, she has changed a bit lately but we were... we had this connection."
1129,1129,6,Mark,False,38,"Which admittedly is kind of going, but... you know, she's funny. Although now I wonder whether she really was funny or whether she was just being normal but I liked her so much I thought she was funny."
1130,1130,6,Mark,False,25,"Plus, when I was at the height of Sophie madness it was when watching her across a hot photocopier... the little looks... the funny doodles."
1131,1131,6,Mark,False,25,"Exactly. It's almost like... the more we've got to know each other, the worse it's been. I mean we really have almost nothing in common."
1132,1132,6,Mark,False,58,"Oh my God. I- I don't have to marry her. Jez, I'm not going to ask her to marry me. There might even be other women in the country who are willing to speak to me and now I can go out and find them. Or just give up on women and eat toasted sandwiches and watch TV."
1133,1133,6,Mark,False,21,"Brilliant! Wow, I feel good. Hey, isn't this-? Jez, this is a footpath! A genuine, National Trust-maintained public right of way!"
1134,1134,6,Mark,False,10,"Jez where you going, you great doofus? It's this way."
1135,1135,6,Mark,False,45,"No, look, Jez we went down and then up, look I've just got this really, really strong feeling that I'm right and you should probably just give in because we both know that I'm a lot more stubborn than you, so just give in now."
1136,1136,6,Mark,False,36,"Honestly Jez, well look if you really are going to go that way then take my fleece and my secret Twix because you are definitely going to be spending a long cold night on the moors."
1137,1137,6,Mark,False,3,Hello. Hello Jez.
1138,1138,6,Mark,False,38,"Well, I sort of slipped into a kind of mini ravine and there was... I angered a crow that was defending its young and then I eventually got a bit of, not exactly sleep, in a disused barn."
1139,1139,6,Mark,True,12,"Urgh, can't believe I pissed on my legs to keep myself warm."
1140,1140,6,Mark,False,2,Thanks Soph.
1141,1141,6,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, yeah, I know Soph, so-"
1142,1142,6,Mark,False,2,What to?
1143,1143,6,Mark,False,2,Oh right.
1144,1144,6,Mark,True,1,Shit!
1145,1145,6,Mark,False,4,"Oh, yeah yeah, no."
1146,1146,6,Mark,False,3,Right then. Hooray.
1147,1147,6,Mark,False,4,"Yes, yes we are."
1148,1148,6,Mark,False,4,"Yep, isn't it great?"
1149,1149,6,Mark,False,3,"Thank you, thanks."
1150,1150,6,Mark,False,8,"No, no, not really, she found the ring."
1151,1151,6,Mark,False,5,"She said yes, she accepted."
1152,1152,6,Mark,False,8,"There was a ring, that's an effective proposal."
1153,1153,6,Mark,False,12,"Well I had to, it was checkmate, there was no way out."
1154,1154,6,Mark,False,25,"Oh right, yeah, sure like that was gonna happen. No I had to accept. It would have been too embarrassing not to accept to acceptance."
1155,1155,6,Mark,False,4,There are worse reasons.
1156,1156,6,Mark,False,7,"Oh no, I'm not the divorcing type."
1157,1157,6,Mark,False,20,"Yes, probably and look, I'd be grateful if for the rest of my life you never mention it again, OK?"
1158,1158,6,Mark,True,20,"This is good. Not really loving her kind of puts me in a position of power. I win, sort of."
