0,0,1,Jeremy,False,9,"I could help for a little sweetener, a fiver?"
1,1,1,Jeremy,False,5,"I just need money, Mark."
2,2,1,Jeremy,False,28,"I don't need to be challenged, Mark, I just need something to do in the mornings, some purpose. I'm tired of staring at my own winkle all day."
3,3,1,Jeremy,True,20,"Hasn't got a girlfriend so he buys a new sofa. You can't fuck a sofa, mate, take it from me."
4,4,1,Jeremy,False,12,"This suit, it's sapping my vibe, my powers. I can't think right."
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,41,"I mean, there weren't any jobs when I didn't want a job. And now I do want a job, there are like, totally, no jobs. Not just like, there aren't any jobs, but like, there are totally, quite literally, no jobs."
6,6,1,Jeremy,False,8,"What is it, sex stuff, booze, drug gear?"
7,7,1,Jeremy,False,7,What?! Why'd you bring that in here?
8,8,1,Jeremy,False,9,There'll be plenty of time for the baby later.
9,9,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah, that's the policy. What's in there, anyway?"
10,10,1,Jeremy,False,2,So small.
11,11,1,Jeremy,False,16,"OK, yeah, it's going under there. Right, it's under there now. It'll be safe under there."
12,12,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Jesus, you are something else."
13,13,1,Jeremy,True,12,"He took the insult as a compliment. Shit, he could become invulnerable."
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,6,Have you not sorted this yet?
15,15,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Phone pig? You're not going to lord it over me, are you, Mark?"
16,16,1,Jeremy,True,6,"Wow, she is one hot tamale."
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,20,"Whatever, I sleep naked, head out of the window, so when I wake up it's just me and the universe."
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,3,Got a system.
19,19,1,Jeremy,True,15,"The maestro, magically made her think of me naked. He didn't even clock her, tragic."
20,20,1,Jeremy,False,4,"What, all of it?"
21,21,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Cool. Whoa, it's tippy, I've got a tippy chair."
22,22,1,Jeremy,False,9,"There's a script? So I'll be, like, an actor?"
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,28,"Well, no, not everyone, 'cause if it's exclusive, then... Oh my God. It's wheels within wheels. I've been invited inside with the bean counters and the water boarders."
24,24,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Hey, man, can't stop, just to say, it's all going super great down there."
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,22,"I've made like, four sales, I'm zinging. Colin's put me the top of the leaderboard. I'm in line for Pizza Hut vouchers."
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,1,What's-?
27,27,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, God, look at you."
28,28,1,Jeremy,False,3,Frightened little mouse.
29,29,1,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, yeah, right, like there's a fire. There's never a fire, Mark, it just doesn't happen. I mean, maybe in a film but-"
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,23,"Not in an office, in England. God, you're pathetic. Ooh, fire, please don't burn me or my possessions. I'm so important and flammable."
31,31,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Come on, Mark, fucking hell, get your elbows in. It's all gone Backdraft."
32,32,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Wow, so everything's just gone tits up. I mean, how mad is that, headfuck or what?"
33,33,1,Jeremy,False,12,"Exactly, Pete was just saying a bunch might go down the Crown."
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,12,"You know, down to the Crown, where everyone goes on a Friday?"
35,35,1,Jeremy,False,11,"I cannot believe this, I can't. They've really screwed us, man."
36,36,1,Jeremy,False,11,"It's like JLB never existed, poof, just poof, gone, so sad."
37,37,1,Jeremy,False,1,Ooh.
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,7,That can't be good for our baby.
39,39,1,Jeremy,False,16,"You should give her a warning look, Mark. Let's try and give her a warning look."
40,40,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Let's not have a little pisshead, Mark."
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Hi, we were just wondering..."
42,42,1,Jeremy,False,3,"The wine, Soph."
43,43,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, we thought that was-"
44,44,1,Jeremy,False,12,"Hear, hear, it's too beautiful a thing to let just go poof!"
45,45,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Right, yeah, a grassroots campaign to get justice."
46,46,1,Jeremy,False,8,"You, in a skit, in front of people?"
47,47,1,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, right, I get it, yeah, the swish of the curtain, the smell of the greasepaint, the rub job in the dressing room."
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,30,"Guess what, we both went to work and it was brilliant, but then the whole company got shut down and it was mad shit, we're both out of a job."
49,49,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Hans, please, this is hard for us. I feel that something's died inside..."
50,50,1,Jeremy,False,3,"don't you, Mark?"
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,17,"Such a weird day for all of us JLBers. I mean, the whole thing's gone. Just poof!"
52,52,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Why, I'm really, really depressed."
53,53,1,Jeremy,False,2,Why not?
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Bollocks, I really felt I was finding my niche."
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,8,Since when did you set the niche-finding times?
56,56,1,Jeremy,False,4,It's a creamy elephant.
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,35,"Hmm, a guy, a guy who needs a bit of cash, a guy, a guy, a guy. Where can we find just a regular guy, any guy? I'm trying to think, but I can't think."
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,17,"Star Wars? ""If you stroke my down, I shall become more purr-full than you can possibly imagine."""
59,59,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Isn't down for a duck, not a cat?"
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,2,Does it?
61,61,1,Jeremy,False,6,"But, ""if you stroke my down..."""
62,62,1,Jeremy,False,10,"I mean it's definitely got to be a duck, because-"
63,63,1,Jeremy,False,5,And where's my onion rings?
64,64,1,Jeremy,False,19,"I've been doing vodka shots with the phone pigs. It's great to see all the old faces, isn't it?"
65,65,1,Jeremy,False,2,I know.
66,66,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Great, you're going to be great, man."
67,67,1,Jeremy,False,2,The moustache?
68,68,1,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
69,69,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Mark, you've got to get the shit-munchers onside. Adolf is a guaranteed hooter."
70,70,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Man, that was so funny. Some of the guys are saying it could be on TV."
71,71,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Heil, Mark."
72,72,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah, when are we gonna get our money?"
73,73,1,Jeremy,False,3,"A bit, yes."
74,74,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Oh, bollocks, Mark! Words and speeches and ideas never change anything. Let's do something."
75,75,1,Jeremy,False,6,Who's up for a raiding party?
76,76,1,Jeremy,False,8,I can't believe they left the door open.
77,77,1,Jeremy,False,2,Super Hans?
78,78,1,Jeremy,False,8,"We're going up there, to fuck shit up."
79,79,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?
80,80,1,Jeremy,False,2,Snow storm!
81,81,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Oh, my God. There she is, Elena, from the flats. Oh, she's so gorgeous."
82,82,2,Jeremy,False,22,"God, I really, really, really, really hope the baby's not mine. The last thing I need is an infant cramping my style."
83,83,2,Jeremy,False,21,"Is it really fifty-fifty, or is it in fact much more likely that my guys will have won the sperm war?"
84,84,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Mine are like soldiers of fortune, the scuba squadron."
85,85,2,Jeremy,False,39,"Yours are probably just glad of the practice, like, ""Yay, we're out, and we're not in the wank flannel!"" Mine are much more, ""OK guys, here we go again. This is the drop zone. You know the drill."" Suave."
86,86,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Right, Laser Commando. See you later."
87,87,2,Jeremy,True,15,"What's he really doing? UKIP meeting? Gay sauna? Maiming farm animals? Don't ask, don't tell."
88,88,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, too right, I'm freezing. Let's whack it up to twenty-nine."
89,89,2,Jeremy,False,22,I don't actually want it to be wenty-nine. But you've got to give it something to aim for. It'll get hotter quicker.
90,90,2,Jeremy,False,55,"Oh, sure. You set it to twenty-three, it'll be pootering along, ""Oh, yeah, twenty-three? Easy, yeah, nearly there."" Wouldn't you rather, ""Fuck, twenty-nine! Christ let's get cracking! Gotta generate some serious heat!"" And then when it hits twenty-three, we're suddenly all like, click, sorry, already there. And the boiler will be like, ""What the fuck?!"""
91,91,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, Soph."
92,92,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Elena, downstairs? She's a dealer?"
93,93,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh, my God, that's it. That's my in. That's our point of connection."
94,94,2,Jeremy,False,27,"Mark, just because today was the first time you have ever, ever, ever, successfully arranged a date with a woman does not suddenly make you Alfie, OK."
95,95,2,Jeremy,True,10,Really hope it doesn't involve anything going up my knob.
96,96,2,Jeremy,False,24,"Yeah, um, here's the thing. It's against my moral philosophy to put anything up my knob. That's just a line I will not cross."
97,97,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Yeah, OK, I'm really not sure about this."
98,98,2,Jeremy,False,58,"I just don't want my bar code on the database. I mean, the truth is, I have banged a lot of chicks. I mean, that's just a matter of historical record. I mean, he's a willing swab-ee. Leave me off-swab. If the baby is not his, then it's mine. If I done the crime, I'll do the time."
99,99,2,Jeremy,False,14,It might not be a boy or a girl? It could be something else?
100,100,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Hey, our odds just dropped."
101,101,2,Jeremy,False,29,"Hey, come on, guys. We're all having a baby together, and that's a terrifying and beautiful and very, very terrifying thing, so come on, let's just keep this civil."
102,102,2,Jeremy,True,23,"Oh God, Elena's front door. Hi, I'm Jez, how's it hanging? Hi, I'm Jez, how's it hanging? Hi, I'm Jez, how's it hanging?"
103,103,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Hi, I'm Jez, how's it hangling?"
104,104,2,Jeremy,True,15,"Oh, my God, is she from Russia? Or one of those other made up countries?"
105,105,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Yeah, I just thought it'd be cool to um- I'm a friend of Sophie's."
106,106,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Er, yes, please. I'm a vegetarian but I eat chicken and fish and posh bacon so-"
107,107,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, right. Right."
108,108,2,Jeremy,True,9,"I'm in, she'll never get rid of me now."
109,109,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, are they in flower already? I love nature-"
110,110,2,Jeremy,True,10,"She said fuck. If I say fuck, maybe we'll fuck."
111,111,2,Jeremy,True,20,"Oh God, she's so beautiful. My head's gone blank. Come on Jez, restart, reboot, vibe up. Heart racing, hands shaky."
112,112,2,Jeremy,False,27,"That's just, er, I get like that when I hadn't had a smoke for a while. I'm not a junkie. I'm just excited. I just love drugs!"
113,113,2,Jeremy,True,9,Where's my vibe? Got to make a connection. Compliment?
114,114,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Hmm. Can I just say, great temperature."
115,115,2,Jeremy,False,18,"I was just saying, you got a great temperature in here. What are you on, out of interest?"
116,116,2,Jeremy,False,3,Mind if I...?
117,117,2,Jeremy,False,2,Twenty-three. Nice.
118,118,2,Jeremy,True,7,"Man, she has got one sweet temperature."
119,119,2,Jeremy,False,35,"It's a great boiler. It's just got a very idiosyncratic control panel. It's like the Jesus and Mary Chain of central heating control systems. Hard to get into initially, but then, so much to explore."
120,120,2,Jeremy,False,22,"Yes, yes she does. I've been to hers twice a day all week. I can't buy any more weed, it's killing me."
121,121,2,Jeremy,False,29,"But it's not a date, that's the whole point. She's just coming upstairs for a smoke. It's simply two very casual people who happen to have perfectly matching genitals."
122,122,2,Jeremy,False,19,"Not a problem, kemosabe. We'll be in my room. Slipping effortlessly from getting high off her own supply to..."
123,123,2,Jeremy,False,2,Sexy time.
124,124,2,Jeremy,False,15,We'll probably do that for a bit and then graduate to some back door action.
125,125,2,Jeremy,True,20,"Oh my God, what is he wearing? He thinks when you're on a date you should look like Des Lynam."
126,126,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Mark, women are coming. We want to make the women hot."
127,127,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Yep, cool, cheers."
128,128,2,Jeremy,False,29,"What? Look, I've just bought her so much, I gotta offload it somewhere. Just because I'm dealing a little bit of drugs does not make me a drug dealer."
129,129,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, God. Come Mister Taliban, tally my bananas!"
130,130,2,Jeremy,False,10,"There's an old women as well, have you seen her?"
131,131,2,Jeremy,True,8,"Hmmm, got to get off the neighbourhood watch."
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,9,"So, tell me Elena. What do you, like, do?"
133,133,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, that is so great."
134,134,2,Jeremy,True,12,"Oh, God, she's perfect. A musician who devotes herself in helping losers."
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,10,"That's just so cool 'cause um, I'm a musician too."
136,136,2,Jeremy,True,1,Shit.
137,137,2,Jeremy,False,10,"I dabble, you know. I toot, I strum, I bongo."
138,138,2,Jeremy,False,17,"Er, that's that's not a bongo, that's just a small table in the shape of a bongo."
139,139,2,Jeremy,True,1,Danger.
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Er, I was a male nurse for a while."
141,141,2,Jeremy,True,8,Disgust at having to help people in need.
142,142,2,Jeremy,False,28,The white coats couldn't handle my whole Patch Adams approach. I believe a person should be treated as a human being not a mere set of steel pipes.
143,143,2,Jeremy,True,34,"Oh, come on. I gotta think of something impressive. What the hell have I been doing all these years? Could be a dad she'd like to fuck? Only thing I've got in the locker."
144,144,2,Jeremy,False,18,"And of course, the big news is actually that I'm, er, I'm going to be having a kid."
145,145,2,Jeremy,False,44,"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, a million times no. No, she's a friend. And she was desperate, and so I was all like, yeah, I'm a very strong feminist, so I believe women should have whatever mad thing they want."
146,146,2,Jeremy,False,40,"Yeah! And also, I'm just really into the whole man, baby thing. You know, teaching them to tie things to other things, and you know, holding a baby in the palm of my hand whilst making an espresso. You know?"
147,147,2,Jeremy,True,9,"Yeah. Russian men are all probably infertile. Thanks, Chernobyl."
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, wow, really, 'cause er, I dabble."
149,149,2,Jeremy,True,9,"Sure, I dabble. Like da Vinci dabbled in art."
150,150,2,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah, I wrote that some time ago, but it's still pretty savage."
151,151,2,Jeremy,False,42,"Really? OK. ""Fuck you, Bush. Fuck you, Bush! It's time to get out of Iraq, Bush. What were you even doing there in the first place, Bush? You didn't even get properly elected, Bush. Are you happy now, Bush? Fuck you, Bush!"""
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Thanks, I did that on purpose."
153,153,2,Jeremy,False,1,Hello?
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, has it? That's marvellous. Marvellous news. Er, excellent, OK then-"
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, obviously. Great, great."
156,156,2,Jeremy,True,8,"Mark or Jeff. Jeff, please Jeff, or Mark."
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,12,"Yes! Well that's great news. Thanks for that. Yes, yes, yes, yes!"
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,10,"That was, er, Sophie. The mother of the- my baby."
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,26,"The news, the wonderful news, is that everything's OK. And it was just so great to hear that. I like daily updates. That's what I'm like."
160,160,2,Jeremy,False,12,Yeah. A human life. Another human life. And it's my responsibility. Forever.
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,6,Can we talk about this later?
162,162,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, it's mine, obviously. It's mine."
163,163,2,Jeremy,False,2,That's right.
164,164,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Well, I was just about to, straight away."
165,165,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, but we should talk."
166,166,2,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
167,167,2,Jeremy,False,7,"I need to speak to you, Mark."
168,168,2,Jeremy,False,21,"Yeah, um... Look. The thing is, contrary to what I said a few seconds ago, it is actually, definitely your baby."
169,169,2,Jeremy,False,3,Sophie told me.
170,170,2,Jeremy,False,6,"The results came. Honestly, it's yours."
171,171,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Look, I know it sounds weird, but I told Elena I was having a baby."
172,172,2,Jeremy,False,17,Because it was the only thing I could of that made me sound like a proper person.
173,173,2,Jeremy,False,10,"I know, I know I am. You must hate me."
174,174,2,Jeremy,False,18,"I'm really sorry, dude. Um, you can hit me, if you like. Or.. er... or even fork me?"
175,175,2,Jeremy,False,3,Fork my leg.
176,176,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Well, you gotta fork something. Fork my bag."
177,177,2,Jeremy,False,37,"Go on, stab my stuff. Fork it to smithereens. Yeah, that's it! Go on, really go for it. My stupid, bloody, special, date dinner. All stabbed to shit just like I deserve. Oh, nice one. Equals pequals."
178,178,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, so it's gonna be the classic one-egg omelette."
179,179,2,Jeremy,True,2,Is he...
180,180,2,Jeremy,False,1,Sorry.
181,181,2,Jeremy,True,8,...having the hardest sex ever? Of course not.
182,182,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Mark, what are you doing?"
183,183,2,Jeremy,False,3,Everything all right?
184,184,2,Jeremy,True,10,"Ugh, they're gonna drench my flirt fest in geek juice."
185,185,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Uh, Mark. Could I have a quick word?"
186,186,2,Jeremy,False,2,It's Sophie.
187,187,2,Jeremy,False,13,"I saw her through the spy hole, but she might have sensed movement."
188,188,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Probably not gonna bother, actually."
189,189,2,Jeremy,True,8,Where did that come from? That's nice lying.
190,190,2,Jeremy,False,12,"So, where were we? And please, no more talk about my baby."
191,191,2,Jeremy,True,12,"Oh, God, what? Has she got in and torn his throat out?"
192,192,2,Jeremy,False,4,"No, I told him."
193,193,2,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, I know. Yeah, I thought it was too, but it looks like it changed, in the womb. Can they do that?"
194,194,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Yes, so why did I say it was mine? It's weird, isn't it?"
195,195,2,Jeremy,False,65,"Wow, how did this happen? OK, the truth is I lied. I said I was having a baby because I wanted to impress you. Because you're beautiful and intelligent and sexy and cool, and I wanted to seem proper because, and I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but... I know I may look like a real person, but I'm not actually a real person."
196,196,2,Jeremy,True,5,I truthed it! Truthing works!
197,197,3,Jeremy,True,8,"I love being me. Morning horn. ""Morning, Jeremy."""
198,198,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Mmm, ring in sick. Tell them Dr. Jeremy says you've got to stay in bed with plenty of fluids. Sexual fluids."
199,199,3,Jeremy,True,39,"Hope she doesn't think I'm really a doctor. First sex with Elena, and it was the best sex I ever had. Wonder why? I just did my usual stuff. Snog, diddle, tongue, diddle, front, behind, cuddle. The set menu."
200,200,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, sure."
201,201,3,Jeremy,True,35,"Why did I say that? I never iron. I have never ironed. I don't even know where the batteries go. Oh, my God, I'm in love. I'm in love with Elena. Oh, my giddy arse!"
202,202,3,Jeremy,False,1,Hey.
203,203,3,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, that's really dreadful for you. Oh, come here."
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,2,Poor you.
205,205,3,Jeremy,False,21,"I'm in love, Mark. With amazing Elena. I don't wanna tempt fate but I think everything's gonna be totally great forever."
206,206,3,Jeremy,False,41,"You don't understand, Mark. I've realised that everything is just a substitute for being in love. Reading, running in the Olympics, getting a job, being a doctor. And I don't need those substitutes any more. Elena is my one true soulmate."
207,207,3,Jeremy,False,14,Who knows how these things happen? There are powers at work beyond our understanding.
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,5,What was it Shakespeare said?
209,209,3,Jeremy,False,28,He basically said something about how there are more things there than there are actual things that you can see with your eyes. That's not the exact quote.
210,210,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Anyway, I'm gonna tell Elena that I love her over dinner, tonight."
211,211,3,Jeremy,False,20,Why do you have to bring worry and doubt into everything? You're like some kind of mad evangelist for anxiety.
212,212,3,Jeremy,True,19,Nice office for a charity. I wonder if people who give money know it goes on massive luxury chairs.
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Hiya sweetheart, ready to go?"
214,214,3,Jeremy,True,25,"Wow! Normally listening to someone else bang on about their job, with their e-mails and meetings and Peters, is incredibly tedious. But I'm actually interested."
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,7,Peter sounds like a honking great wanker.
216,216,3,Jeremy,True,24,"Why am I so nervous? I feel like I'm about to take an exam, but one that actually matters, not some mad university exam."
217,217,3,Jeremy,True,30,"Maybe I should text ""I love you"" to her. Is that romantic? Or is that shit? In the same way that Steve Wright's Sunday Love Songs is so hugely shit?"
218,218,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Mm? Oh God, yes!"
219,219,3,Jeremy,True,7,"OK, I'm doing it now. Let's roll."
220,220,3,Jeremy,False,26,"Bread really is excellent, isn't it? Nice and dense. I love you very much. Mark actually got some bread recently that was made from spelt flour."
221,221,3,Jeremy,True,20,"OK, interesting response. Did she hear? Maybe it went in anyway. Like when you slip tablets into your dog's food."
222,222,3,Jeremy,False,14,"No, yes, that's good, great. Just to be clear you don't love me back?"
223,223,3,Jeremy,False,28,Do you think I'm vain? Some people think I'm quite vain. Or lazy? Do I talk too much? Am I talking too much now? Shall I shut up?
224,224,3,Jeremy,False,4,"I'm selfish, aren't I?"
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,2,Got it.
226,226,3,Jeremy,True,32,I'm a huge selfish bastard. I knew I should have gone down on her for ten minutes instead of the set-menu five. À la carte. I should have gone à la carte.
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, I didn't really go to bed. I just sort of listened to some music and did quite a bit of crying."
228,228,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Right, I'm off to Hastings."
229,229,3,Jeremy,False,18,Yeah. There's a bakers there that does Elena's favorite bread. Made of spelt flour. I'm getting her some.
230,230,3,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, it's a selfless act. I mean, Hastings is, like, a really long, long way away. It's in Kent or somewhere stupid."
231,231,3,Jeremy,False,8,And I'm trying to do less selfish things...
232,232,3,Jeremy,False,11,"...and more altruistic stuff, to prove I'm worthy of Elena's love."
233,233,3,Jeremy,False,7,"You've obviously never been in love, Mark."
234,234,3,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, gotta go, see you later."
235,235,3,Jeremy,False,8,I got you your favorite bread. Impson's bread.
236,236,3,Jeremy,False,26,"And I got you some truffle oil to drizzle on it. Everyone's into truffle oil, Jamie, Nigella, those two men who look like burglars on MasterChef."
237,237,3,Jeremy,True,7,I've been to fucking Hastings! In Kent.
238,238,3,Jeremy,False,3,How was work?
239,239,3,Jeremy,False,8,Bad stuff? Do you mean porn? Horny porno?
240,240,3,Jeremy,False,5,You watch porn at work?
241,241,3,Jeremy,False,14,Course it doesn't bother me! It's hot! Do you... you know... while you're watching?
242,242,3,Jeremy,False,4,"God, this is great!"
243,243,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Look, I'll think of a plan to sort this out. But, first, let's get you some Impson's bread and odd oil."
244,244,3,Jeremy,True,13,"You watch porno, you watch porno. That's the best thing in the world."
245,245,3,Jeremy,False,2,"So, yes."
246,246,3,Jeremy,True,27,"Shit, is this a good idea? When Meat Loaf sang ""I would do anything for love, but I won't do that"", maybe this is what he meant."
247,247,3,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
248,248,3,Jeremy,True,8,"I'm going with the plan. Come on, plan."
249,249,3,Jeremy,False,17,"So, as I was saying, er, I came in here to collect Elena, and, you saw me."
250,250,3,Jeremy,False,32,"But then she had to go and make a call. Elsewhere. And it was at that point that I then... downloaded, and watched the... inappropriate material that was found on her computer."
251,251,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah. I get bored very quickly. But Elena had nothing to do with it, and I am... sorrowful."
252,252,3,Jeremy,True,2,Payload delivered.
253,253,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Good, so that's all cleared up then, great."
254,254,3,Jeremy,True,6,"Shit. OK, time to go nuclear."
255,255,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Look, Peter, the truth is, I'm a sex addict. I wank ten, maybe twelve times a day."
256,256,3,Jeremy,False,9,Yes. Or more. It's a disease. A wanking disease.
257,257,3,Jeremy,True,4,One more for luck?
258,258,3,Jeremy,False,5,I have a wanking disease.
259,259,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Right. Sorry, no, I'm not with you."
260,260,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Brilliant! So, she's got away with it? Excellent, OK, thanks dude."
261,261,3,Jeremy,True,30,My genius plan has worked. I'm golden with Elena now. I took a wank bullet for her. This day may become special for us. Our internet wank blame anniversary day.
262,262,3,Jeremy,False,26,"Horse racing's just a freak show, isn't it? ""Oh, let's put loads of tiny, seven-stone men on horses and make them race each other"". It's disgusting."
263,263,3,Jeremy,False,25,"Oh right, they enjoy it do they, the tiny men? Like the elephant enjoys doing the ballet moves? It's exploitation, Mark. What are you doing?"
264,264,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Mm, the speed bump. Slow down, children ahead."
265,265,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Oh, fuck her! This is your dream, man. We're both living the dream. I'm in love with Elena, you're in love with the past-oes."
266,266,3,Jeremy,False,27,"The people from the past. The olden-days-ers. Right, I'm off downstairs. Gotta be in for the Ocado man at Elena's. Then I'm picking up her dry cleaning."
267,267,3,Jeremy,False,33,"Nah, this is all voluntary. My job is being in love with Elena. And it's a great job. And she's almost definitely in love with me now, after I took the wank bullet."
268,268,3,Jeremy,False,41,"I did feel a bit humiliated and awful. But it's worth it for Elena. Oh, and I saw the porn she was looking at. Man, it's hot. I mean, she's got great taste. It's the most fantastic porn I've ever seen."
269,269,3,Jeremy,False,21,"No, it's great. Like everything she's into. You know, girl on girl, on another girl, with a guy, in a warehouse."
270,270,3,Jeremy,False,7,What about doing it as Sherlock Holmes?
271,271,3,Jeremy,False,6,"You could say ""elementary"" a lot."
272,272,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Yes, he did, everyone knows that. It's ""elementary""."
273,273,3,Jeremy,False,2,Balls again?
274,274,3,Jeremy,False,8,"I didn't recommend it, I'm not Time Out."
275,275,3,Jeremy,False,5,And you didn't wipe it?
276,276,3,Jeremy,False,13,"Always wipe, Mark. ""Discharge your pipe, then have a wipe."" That's the rhyme."
277,277,3,Jeremy,False,1,No.
278,278,3,Jeremy,False,16,"I don't want to take another wank bullet. What am I, some kind of wank shield?"
279,279,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, don't be a cock."
280,280,3,Jeremy,False,6,When? What are you talking about?
281,281,3,Jeremy,False,7,Is it over? How did he do?
282,282,3,Jeremy,False,60,"Great. I was feeling a bit guilty about not coming. You know I think I've been taking Mark a bit for granted since I started seeing Elena. You know, it's been, Elena this, Elena that, all the time. Elena, Elena, Elena. And that's wrong. Anyway, Elena said I should come and make it up with him, so, here I am."
283,283,3,Jeremy,False,9,"File? Ah. That wasn't actually Mark's fault, that file."
284,284,3,Jeremy,False,46,"The porn on your computer, Jan, the hardcore pornographic sex film on your laptop, that was me. I'm fundamentally a sex addict. I wank ten, maybe twelve times a day. It's a disease. A wanking disease. I done the downloading and then I done a wank."
285,285,4,Jeremy,False,28,So you'll buy tissue paper for me to physically wipe my sphincter but you won't buy a bit of lube to ease the giving and receiving of pleasure?
286,286,4,Jeremy,False,29,He won't wanna shoot the shit. He's probably got loads or arsehole mates that he goes white-water rafting and shooting the shit and killing strippers with the whole time.
287,287,4,Jeremy,False,18,It's Elena's birthday present. A bust of her head. It's not finished. What? Do you think it's weird?
288,288,4,Jeremy,False,13,"I mean I've got loads of other presents, this is just the topper."
289,289,4,Jeremy,False,25,Amazing! It's impossible to say just how great she is just using stupid words. Maybe one day you'll fall in love and then you'll understand.
290,290,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Great. Join us. Tell us about your day, dude."
291,291,4,Jeremy,False,11,Oh my God! That's so exciting. Tell us all about it.
292,292,4,Jeremy,False,10,We were just chatting about having a mini-break in Crete.
293,293,4,Jeremy,False,10,"There's no war or bomb shit in Crete, is there?"
294,294,4,Jeremy,False,5,Cool. I'll get some voddy.
295,295,4,Jeremy,False,3,Tell him what?
296,296,4,Jeremy,False,5,What's up? What's going on?
297,297,4,Jeremy,False,1,What?
298,298,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Look, what the hell is going on?"
299,299,4,Jeremy,False,2,What? Elena?
300,300,4,Jeremy,False,5,How long have you known?
301,301,4,Jeremy,False,8,You've known for two whole days? That's sick!
302,302,4,Jeremy,True,13,"What a bastard! Destroys my perfect love, just 'cause it's built on lies."
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,6,"So this thing, is it serious?"
304,304,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Oh, right. Is he dying? Is it a poet in a diving bell? Is it really sad and weird but soon he'll be gone?"
305,305,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, shit."
306,306,4,Jeremy,False,11,Gail? As in a woman? This love rival is a chick?
307,307,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Mark, you dick. You've got it all wrong again."
308,308,4,Jeremy,False,15,Everything's going to be fine. The other guy is a woman. They're both two women.
309,309,4,Jeremy,False,28,"Well, a bit. But basically, not really. I mean, me and this Gail, we're just eating from different sides of the plate. I play woodwind, she's on brass."
310,310,4,Jeremy,False,23,Because it's hot! I mean even a dried up desiccated old bran flake on toast like you should be able to see that.
311,311,4,Jeremy,False,7,"It's great, isn't it? Having an affair."
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Hah, yeah, mad mad shit."
313,313,4,Jeremy,True,8,"Heading for a threesome, a sexy lesbo threesome."
314,314,4,Jeremy,True,13,"Eh, shirt too much? Shit, do I possibly look a total dick here?"
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,27,"Good. Just another local pothead. That's me. I live upstairs. Buy the pot here, take it there. That's my system. If you can call it a system."
316,316,4,Jeremy,False,6,"OK, well, see you around. Neighbour."
317,317,4,Jeremy,True,24,"Not so clever now I'm humping your girlfriend, are you? You might be a big Mensan but you haven't figured that one out, eh?"
318,318,4,Jeremy,False,1,Bye.
319,319,4,Jeremy,True,5,"It's perfect. Happy birthday, Elena!"
320,320,4,Jeremy,False,17,She texted to say she couldn't make it. Gail took the morning off work and surprised her.
321,321,4,Jeremy,False,39,"Good, yeah, it's hot. We were gonna watch ""The Wrestler"" last night but she'd already seen it with Gail so we watched Grand Designs and then Gail came home and so I had to leave. But yeah, pretty hot."
322,322,4,Jeremy,False,55,"Actually, man, that would be really nice. Ugh, Big Suze. She keeps leaving these endless messages saying about how pissed off she is with Johnson and how he goes around writing his name on all the fruit and if she accidentally eats a ""Johnson orange"" then he totally loses it. How's it going with Consultiarium?"
323,323,4,Jeremy,False,1,Really?
324,324,4,Jeremy,False,2,Daddy's hat?
325,325,4,Jeremy,False,3,I don't know.
326,326,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Mark, maybe scratch the pancakes. Gail's gone out to Pilates, I've got a window."
327,327,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Exactly. Back to the coalface. Right, OK. Keys, condoms, present. OK, off to my affair. See you later."
328,328,4,Jeremy,False,6,And that's the front room actually.
329,329,4,Jeremy,False,22,Relax. It's just a couple of neighbours come down to have a chat about you getting a job in a Mexican restaurant.
330,330,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Gail walked in out of the blue again and I thought, wouldn't it be great if you were to track her movements for me?"
331,331,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Yup. Yes, he is. Sign him up. Right, booze. Oh, I don't believe it! I've forgotten to get booze."
332,332,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Nonsense, I'll pop to the offie."
333,333,4,Jeremy,False,11,"And Elena, you wanted me to remind you about the... thing."
334,334,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Elena, remember? You said ""My car's on play and display, please remind me."" So I'm just reminding you."
335,335,4,Jeremy,False,4,I'll walk you down.
336,336,4,Jeremy,False,16,It means she's very perceptive. She spots things that other people miss. She's very highly attuned.
337,337,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Come on, we've got a window."
338,338,4,Jeremy,False,23,"Do you think I was in the mood this morning? Of course I wasn't! But I didn't let that stop me, did I?"
339,339,4,Jeremy,False,1,Fine.
340,340,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Hello, I'm back. I got the booze."
341,341,4,Jeremy,False,25,"Yeah, yeah. I got some rum. Everyone likes rum, don't they? And I have to admit I had a little bit on the way back."
342,342,4,Jeremy,False,20,"You know how it is when you can't wait a second to get a hit of that neat, sweet rum."
343,343,4,Jeremy,True,4,Heading for a bedding.
344,344,4,Jeremy,False,1,Sexy.
345,345,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh-huh, right."
346,346,4,Jeremy,False,4,What did you say?
347,347,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Nice. Elena, what would you do if she did find out about me? I mean, who would you choose?"
348,348,4,Jeremy,False,4,But you're choosing me?
349,349,4,Jeremy,True,9,"Great, Mr Chosen, on the balcony, in his pants."
350,350,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Look, I do have limits you know. I have self-respect. I might jump."
351,351,4,Jeremy,True,14,Maybe I will jump. That'd show her. Quite high. Obviously I'm not gonna jump.
352,352,4,Jeremy,False,1,Mark!
353,353,4,Jeremy,False,1,Mark!
354,354,4,Jeremy,False,1,Mark!
355,355,4,Jeremy,False,15,"It's some shirts with a tennis ball tied in the end. It's good, isn't it?"
356,356,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Look, I'm freezing. Can you throw me a rope?"
357,357,4,Jeremy,False,9,What do you mean you haven't got a rope?
358,358,4,Jeremy,False,3,Climb up it.
359,359,4,Jeremy,False,6,Or you could pull me up.
360,360,4,Jeremy,False,2,Crawl? Right.
361,361,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Right, great. I'm golden."
362,362,4,Jeremy,True,19,"This is good. It's sexy, romantic, daring. I'm like a modern day Casanova. Raffles, the gentleman perv. No clothes."
363,363,4,Jeremy,True,4,Raffles doesn't deserve clothes.
364,364,4,Jeremy,False,1,Johnson?
365,365,5,Jeremy,False,25,"I am so proud of you. There was everyone thinking you were just this fusty, sweater-wearing, spirit-crushing, no-fly-zone with ten foot carrot up his arse."
366,366,5,Jeremy,False,24,"This is the only reason anyone in recorded history has had a party, Mark. Plus, it's great for me. Perfect way to see Elena."
367,367,5,Jeremy,False,24,"Nah, she's just playing it cool and I just need to do the same. It's Snoopy in shades versus the Fonz in a fridge."
368,368,5,Jeremy,False,80,"Oh, hi Elena. Yeah, Jez here. Just to say, you know, me and Mark are partying hard this Saturday. I've invited everyone else and then I thought of you. So, uh, there's gonna be some cats from the music biz. Uh, a few cats from film and new media. You know, a whole crowd of cool cats and crazy chicks. Chicks with dicks, chicks without dicks. Guys with dicks. Maybe see you up here, maybe not. Bye-bye. Bye bye-bye bye."
369,369,5,Jeremy,False,6,What is it? Creamy Elephant repayments?
370,370,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Wow, that's pretty real."
371,371,5,Jeremy,False,16,"Yeah, just sign that shit up, that's what I'd say. Sign and recline, that's my motto."
372,372,5,Jeremy,False,2,Hey man!
373,373,5,Jeremy,False,8,I'm gaffer taping bin bags to the floor.
374,374,5,Jeremy,False,9,To protect the carpet from all the various fluids.
375,375,5,Jeremy,False,11,I know! Why the hell have you bought so much food?
376,376,5,Jeremy,False,17,"Nobody cares about the food at parties, Mark. They just want to get pissed and go ape."
377,377,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Right, I'll do the salad in a minute. Right now I'm setting up puke points."
378,378,5,Jeremy,False,27,"There are seven puke points. The toilet is puke point HQ, obviously. And then I've gone round emptying the bins and distributing bags as secondary puke points."
379,379,5,Jeremy,False,35,"So, what'd you reckon? How many buttons? 'Cause like one is old school, Blair on holiday. Two is the new one. So I was thinking maybe three, but then if I'm doing three maybe four?"
380,380,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Five lasagnes, Mark? Lasagnes can't save you. You are still gonna have to talk to people, you know?"
381,381,5,Jeremy,False,6,"That's big of you, inviting him."
382,382,5,Jeremy,False,3,It's kicking off!
383,383,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Chemical castration, classic!"
384,384,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Whoa, snake, massive. What's it called?"
385,385,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Mark, it's only 8:45."
386,386,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Yeah, that's right. You should have put more black pepper in the lasagne, then it would be rammed."
387,387,5,Jeremy,False,10,Oh for fuck's sake. I'm off to get a drink.
388,388,5,Jeremy,False,9,Great work. Raj Persaud on the wheels of steel.
389,389,5,Jeremy,False,28,"Oh hi, great to see you. Remind me did I ever call you back after you called me all those times after we had that great night together?"
390,390,5,Jeremy,True,8,"Oh crap, everyone's gonna know I'm toxic waste."
391,391,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Ooh God, Elena. This is not all my chickens coming home to roost, Mark. All right? Don't stand there thinking it is."
392,392,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Pft, yeah, so I'm just spinning some tracks actually."
393,393,5,Jeremy,False,3,Maybe you should.
394,394,5,Jeremy,True,39,"Yeah, the cool off. I'm relaxed. Snoopy on a lude. Who's gonna break first? Not me, sweetheart. Yeah sure. Go on, talk to a guy. Why not? Maybe I'll shag a guy too. How would you like that, hmm?"
395,395,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Hey man, look at us!"
396,396,5,Jeremy,False,5,I'm having a good time.
397,397,5,Jeremy,False,9,Give her a bell? Let her have some flavour?
398,398,5,Jeremy,False,10,"Exactly! God, everyone's going mad for the lasagne. Who knew?"
399,399,5,Jeremy,False,5,Yeah. They're not my mates.
400,400,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Dude, it just means we're a hit."
401,401,5,Jeremy,True,21,"Look at him. Oh, hilarious. Oh, I've got a rented snake. It's just like a bendy cock or dangerous sausage. Hilarious."
402,402,5,Jeremy,True,4,"OK, take this Elena."
403,403,5,Jeremy,False,6,Could we have a quick chat?
404,404,5,Jeremy,False,23,I just wanted say I'm sorry about the way I behaved. It was basically because I couldn't handle the strength of my feelings.
405,405,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Seriously, Sarah."
406,406,5,Jeremy,True,5,"It is Sarah, isn't it?"
407,407,5,Jeremy,False,4,I think you're incredible.
408,408,5,Jeremy,False,10,"You're just a very alive, very incredible, very sexual being."
409,409,5,Jeremy,True,4,Thirty-all in flirt tennis.
410,410,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, ew. It looks like somebody's taken out puke point HQ."
411,411,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, what? Because your friends don't poo?"
412,412,5,Jeremy,True,23,Look at that. The Devil and Eve and a serpent. And if there was an apple this would be a whole famous... thing.
413,413,5,Jeremy,True,6,That's it. That's just fucking it.
414,414,5,Jeremy,False,24,"Yeah, um, just an idea but would it be OK mate if you fucked off before I ram a wine bottle up your cock?"
415,415,5,Jeremy,True,8,This is it. I've got to say it.
416,416,5,Jeremy,False,50,"Look, I just fucking love you. I love you and I don't want to play it cool any more because I would eat my own fingers just to look at your face. I will be your dog or your human mannequin. I'll do anything you say. I just want you."
417,417,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Well, yeah. I mean I don't want that involves exactly, but..."
418,418,5,Jeremy,False,20,"I was trying to play stupid games, but I can't. I just want to fuck your brain into my brain."
419,419,5,Jeremy,True,9,"Oh wow, I've pulled. I've pulled my own girlfriend."
420,420,5,Jeremy,False,10,"Wow, if sex was an Olympic event, we'd win gold."
421,421,5,Jeremy,True,7,"Oh, the cock clamp. The inevitable hulk."
422,422,5,Jeremy,True,11,"Oh back to playing rhythm guitar, the back-up, the human carrot."
423,423,5,Jeremy,False,17,"You know what, Elena? I'm not doing this any more. I love you, you've got to choose."
424,424,5,Jeremy,False,38,"Come on, Gail's had her go, now I want first dibs. She can skulk around and you can have an affair behind my back except you know what? No, you can't, because I want you all to myself."
425,425,5,Jeremy,False,4,She's taking the piss!
426,426,5,Jeremy,True,13,She's mine. Maybe we'll move to Russia or wherever the hell she's from.
427,427,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Gail, great you could make it."
428,428,5,Jeremy,True,8,You're about to get dumped. Have a lager.
429,429,5,Jeremy,True,8,Come on in to your emotional torture pit.
430,430,5,Jeremy,True,6,"Yeah that's right, kiss goodbye, forever."
431,431,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh yeah, hello."
432,432,5,Jeremy,False,19,I'd love to stay and chat but I've got to go and give that ill-looking man an enormous drink.
433,433,5,Jeremy,False,2,Aye-aye captain.
434,434,5,Jeremy,True,16,That'll teach her to write four or five line poems. Look at all that brilliant crying.
435,435,5,Jeremy,False,3,What's going on?
436,436,5,Jeremy,False,1,Wow!
437,437,5,Jeremy,True,13,"Oh my God, she's grasping at straws. This is gonna be so embarrassing."
438,438,5,Jeremy,True,12,"She said ""yes"". But, maybe she thinks ""no"" is ""yes"" in English."
439,439,5,Jeremy,False,4,This really is amazing.
440,440,5,Jeremy,False,3,What the fuck?!
441,441,5,Jeremy,False,1,Whoops?!
442,442,5,Jeremy,True,37,"She's so suggestible, like a sexy robot anyone can hack into and program. There it goes. Lesbian kiss, and no one minds. Where have all the homophobes gone when you need them? God, people are so fickle."
443,443,5,Jeremy,False,6,Gail and Elena just got engaged.
444,444,5,Jeremy,False,6,Wasn't it in the salad spinner?
445,445,5,Jeremy,False,3,A bong hit?
446,446,5,Jeremy,False,3,You've been watching.
447,447,5,Jeremy,True,13,"Hmm, maybe he'll become a pothead and he can start buying the stash."
448,448,5,Jeremy,False,3,Are you OK?
449,449,5,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
450,450,5,Jeremy,False,1,Great!
451,451,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Puke point three, puke point three!"
452,452,5,Jeremy,True,16,Aw poor guy. I'm not even gonna mention that he was snitty about my puke points.
453,453,5,Jeremy,True,22,"Oh what a disaster. Love is all you need. No, actually, Beatles. You also need a person to do it with, Beatles."
454,454,5,Jeremy,False,1,Shit!
455,455,5,Jeremy,True,20,"Oh great. Could turn her down. Yeah dream on, second lay of the night. This is the worst party ever."
456,456,6,Jeremy,False,8,"I know, wow! That was pretty good... work."
457,457,6,Jeremy,False,30,"I just wish that, without doing a porno, there was some way for us to make financial profit out of how good we are at doing it to each other."
458,458,6,Jeremy,False,4,And you love me.
459,459,6,Jeremy,False,4,That is so great.
460,460,6,Jeremy,False,28,"Mm-hmm. The only downer is, and I know you've explained why it won't, but it almost feels as if it might affect our relationship, you marrying someone else."
461,461,6,Jeremy,False,15,"I mean, it's gonna be horrible for me, seeing you two tie the civil-partnership knot."
462,462,6,Jeremy,False,1,No?
463,463,6,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
464,464,6,Jeremy,True,1,Quebec?
465,465,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, no."
466,466,6,Jeremy,False,18,I think I would have remembered if you'd told me that you're leaving me to go to Quebec.
467,467,6,Jeremy,False,26,"What, like one of the group? Like one of your fans? I mean, forget the picnic, why don't I just subscribe to updates on your blog?"
468,468,6,Jeremy,False,8,"I was joking! I'm definitely, definitely, definitely coming."
469,469,6,Jeremy,True,16,"She can't leave me for Quebec. I'll steal her passport. Steal it, cook it, eat it."
470,470,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, it is exciting."
471,471,6,Jeremy,True,18,"Yeah, I guess it was pretty exciting when they assassinated JFK. Unless you happen to love JFK's brain."
472,472,6,Jeremy,False,20,"Hey, you know what I fancy? A row on the lake! Elena? Anyone fancy a row on the lake? Elena?"
473,473,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Come on, it'll be fun!"
474,474,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Come on, get in. We can go for a row. We can have secret rowing boat sex!"
475,475,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, come on, please! This could be the last time we're alone together ever. I can't believe you're just getting married and going."
476,476,6,Jeremy,False,46,"Yes, weird. That's exactly the word I was looking for. It's so weird. Weird like, ""come over here and drop your nuts into this deep fat fryer"", ""Oh, OK, ooh, that's a bit weird, what a weird sensation, how weird!"" I'm losing my fucking mind here!"
477,477,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Uh, no, not really, no."
478,478,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Um, actually, you know what? There is room, room for all of us, in the bow, or the stern, or the quarter deck."
479,479,6,Jeremy,True,8,"That's planes, you utter, utter, terrible, stupid dick."
480,480,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, really."
481,481,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, that's great."
482,482,6,Jeremy,True,28,"What can I do, make a pass at her? She won't be interested, but it might put spanner in the works in some way no one can predict?"
483,483,6,Jeremy,False,1,Really?
484,484,6,Jeremy,True,60,"God, it would be so great if she just fell in the water. A few big bubbles and then a few smaller ones and then, poof! Problem gone. She definitely said she can't swim. I definitely couldn't push her in. It would be so much easier if she wasn't a human being with hopes and dreams and clinging, grasping arms."
485,485,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, OK."
486,486,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!"
487,487,6,Jeremy,True,12,"Oh no, this is terrible! I thought she said she couldn't swim."
488,488,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, fine, good."
489,489,6,Jeremy,True,5,Stop going on about it.
490,490,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, well, uh, cheers."
491,491,6,Jeremy,False,1,What?
492,492,6,Jeremy,False,14,"I tried to kill her, Mark. I think I tried to bloody drown her."
493,493,6,Jeremy,False,14,"I was thinking, I want her to fall in, and she did fall in."
494,494,6,Jeremy,False,16,Who knows what I'm capable of? I could kill anyone in this room with a pencil.
495,495,6,Jeremy,False,3,"God, I'm evil."
496,496,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Thanks, man."
497,497,6,Jeremy,False,7,I'm thinking about Elena and watching Jaws.
498,498,6,Jeremy,False,30,"Um, that's a thoughtful question. Erm... no. As it happens, I don't think I've had enough to drink. I'm going to carry on drinking until they catch Jaws the shark."
499,499,6,Jeremy,False,21,"Of course the shark's called Jaws. Here comes Jaws, Jaws the shark, mind he doesn't bite you with his enormous jaws."
500,500,6,Jeremy,False,37,"Oh my life, it's a text from Elena! ""Thinking of you,"" she's thinking of me, Mark! Or at least she was six hours ago. With three kisses! Oh my god, this is massive. I'm going over there."
501,501,6,Jeremy,False,17,"I don't know, who knows what I'm capable of? I mean, I proved that on the lake."
502,502,6,Jeremy,False,4,Where's the car keys?
503,503,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Give me the car keys, Mark."
504,504,6,Jeremy,False,8,"All right, let's get you driving, I'm teaching."
505,505,6,Jeremy,False,48,"Hello, I need your best driver and your fastest car. No, two hours is no good, I need someone immediately. OK, well how about you get off your great fat anus and come and drive me yourself, you self-important hick? Hello? Hello, I retract that last comment. Hello?"
506,506,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Well, let's go! Let's do it, man! Here come the cavalry!"
507,507,6,Jeremy,False,7,"This is perfect, Gail's out, I'm in."
508,508,6,Jeremy,False,11,"You'll be fine, Mark, just drive. Except not like a dick."
509,509,6,Jeremy,False,18,"I don't know, nobody knows, it doesn't matter, it's lost knowledge, like how the aliens did the pyramids."
510,510,6,Jeremy,False,3,"God, you're depressing."
511,511,6,Jeremy,False,20,"Shit! Oh fuck off! It's not his fault he's a dick! He's doing his fucking best, isn't he? Screw you!"
512,512,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Right, step on it. This could be my last ever sex window."
513,513,6,Jeremy,False,73,"There, you see? You can do it. Very, very slowly, thirty to forty stalls, one major steering error, bit of me on clutch at the crossroads when the nasty man was beeping, but you can do it. Right, I'm just gonna nip in there, persuade her not to get married, convince her that I'm the guy for her, quick bit of how's-your-father, not murder anyone, back in five, off to the hospital. Cushty."
514,514,6,Jeremy,False,7,"All right, Soph, have a good one."
515,515,6,Jeremy,False,13,"But Jez'll be really, really pissed off if he misses it, he's excited!"
516,516,6,Jeremy,False,7,"OK, OK! Go, go! Go, go, go!"
517,517,6,Jeremy,False,21,"Gail, she's coming back. Down the road, we need to get out of here. Go, go, go, pedal to the metal."
518,518,6,Jeremy,False,3,You fucking stalled!
519,519,6,Jeremy,False,18,"Fucking go, we need to get out of here, if Gail sees me here, everything's finished, just go!"
520,520,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Go, go, fucking go!"
521,521,6,Jeremy,False,10,"OK, and relax, and engage fucking reverse gear, and go!"
522,522,6,Jeremy,False,7,"You've got the handbrake on, you cock!"
523,523,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Move it, you arsehole!"
524,524,6,Jeremy,False,8,"Why are you indicating? Don't indicate, fucking go!"
525,525,6,Jeremy,False,4,That's it! Come on.
526,526,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Come on, get out, you can't drive."
527,527,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Out. No wonder you failed your test, you div!"
528,528,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Come on, Soph."
529,529,6,Jeremy,False,2,Oh fuck!
530,530,6,Jeremy,False,3,Oh my God.
531,531,6,Jeremy,False,9,"I did it again, Mark. I did it again."
532,532,6,Jeremy,False,9,"I tried to kill her, I went for her."
533,533,6,Jeremy,False,29,"I'm having an affair. We're having an affair. We've been doing it behind your back, and now it's all come out because I keep on trying to kill you."
534,534,1,Mark,False,12,"Now, look, Hans, I want you to be careful taking it out."
535,535,1,Mark,False,2,The axe?
536,536,1,Mark,False,4,"No, Hans, no axes."
537,537,1,Mark,False,35,"A fee? Oh I suppose you never really sat on that sofa much, did you? Maybe just for about a hundred thousand hours. And I suppose you won't sit on the new sofa much, either."
538,538,1,Mark,False,25,"Yes, well, I don't want to pay you for domestic chores. That's why I'm abusing my management position to get you challenging work at JLB."
539,539,1,Mark,False,18,And careful bringing the new one in. Chipped paintwork and abrasions to the upholstery will result in deductions.
540,540,1,Mark,False,31,"Yeah, well, why don't you get another job? You could explore that opening at the giant beanstalk, catching the golden eggs as they fall from the arse of the giant's chicken."
541,541,1,Mark,False,4,We're not doing baby.
542,542,1,Mark,False,14,"The baby's too big. You can't look at it, Hans, it's like the sun."
543,543,1,Mark,False,11,"No, no, no thank you. Put it under the bed, Jeremy."
544,544,1,Mark,False,6,"OK, keys, change, wallet, phone. OK?"
545,545,1,Mark,False,4,Thank you very much.
546,546,1,Mark,False,19,"I'm just going to take off my flatmate hat and put on my much larger, new JLB manager's hat."
547,547,1,Mark,False,40,"Hi, Colin, listen, buddy, could you do me a favour and take a punt on a grunt? Yeah, farmyard fodder, a day player. No overheads, no holiday, no contract. Cut and shut, a phone pig. Ha-ha! Exactly, cool, bro, thanks."
548,548,1,Mark,False,3,Of course not.
549,549,1,Mark,True,31,Maybe I could make him wear a little coloured hat like they do with chimpanzees. A cone with a propeller on top. I might tell him it's a first day tradition.
550,550,1,Mark,False,11,Did you hear the boiler in the night? Were you hot?
551,551,1,Mark,False,11,But how? Your bed's on the other side of the room.
552,552,1,Mark,True,12,"Think she spotted it. Just, yeah, that's right, sweetheart. Ergonomic management keyboard."
553,553,1,Mark,False,22,"So this is it, Jeremy, the field of screams. Colin will be in in ten, but I think this'll be your... area."
554,554,1,Mark,False,2,"Er, yes."
555,555,1,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, so you'll just be following the cold-calling script."
556,556,1,Mark,False,33,"Exactly, Jeremy, you'll be just like an actor, like Al Pacino or Jeremy Irons. Just tell everyone you call up ""hello, you've been specially selected as eligible for our exclusive introductory interest rate."""
557,557,1,Mark,True,12,At some point he's going to find out what goes in sausages.
558,558,1,Mark,True,46,"Out with the artificial limb, the salary man keyboard. In with the dominator, the Death Star. Yeah, Dobby, I'll summon her in later. Er, Dobby, I seem to be having a server problem. Could you have a fiddle? I think the problem is in my pants."
559,559,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, Jeff!"
560,560,1,Mark,False,9,Not too busy to check in with your boss.
561,561,1,Mark,False,32,"I'm head of a team that contains people of your level. I'm certainly your superior, let's leave it at that. I'm on your remuneration committee, so fingers crossed for that bonus, Jeff."
562,562,1,Mark,True,13,"What's funnier, zero bonus or, like, a humiliating £103? Both are very funny."
563,563,1,Mark,False,18,"You're not leaving, Jeremy, you've got to stay until at least five or it makes me look bad."
564,564,1,Mark,False,13,You're king of the farmyard? You're in line for the free garlic bread?
565,565,1,Mark,False,2,Fire alarm.
566,566,1,Mark,False,1,What?
567,567,1,Mark,False,5,"It's a fire alarm, Jeremy."
568,568,1,Mark,False,8,"So what, there's never been a fire, anywhere?"
569,569,1,Mark,False,4,Is this a test?
570,570,1,Mark,False,3,What's going on?
571,571,1,Mark,False,7,"Right, chance would be a fine thing."
572,572,1,Mark,True,8,"That's a thing that people say, isn't it?"
573,573,1,Mark,False,7,"Chance would be a fine thing, Lisa!"
574,574,1,Mark,False,13,"Good one, Jeff. Chance would be a fine thing. A fine thing, indeed."
575,575,1,Mark,True,6,"Hmm, saying that too often now."
576,576,1,Mark,False,14,"Everything's under control. We'll, we'll have it all sorted, as soon as, quick as."
577,577,1,Mark,True,22,"Oh, thank God, Johnson. The great helmsman can march us to a grain depot and we can bed down for the night."
578,578,1,Mark,True,26,"But no, I've just started being a boss! What about my Danish sofa, what about my keyboard? I didn't get to show Dad a business card."
579,579,1,Mark,False,11,"Alan, Alan, where do management go? Alan, let me in, Alan!"
580,580,1,Mark,True,22,The last Beemer out of Saigon. I'm at the mercy of the Vietnamese peasants. Please don't put me in a bamboo cage.
581,581,1,Mark,False,7,"Yes, Jeremy, it is indeed a headfuck."
582,582,1,Mark,False,2,The Crown?
583,583,1,Mark,False,7,"Oh, right, yeah, yeah, down the Crown."
584,584,1,Mark,True,10,"Great, one morning and he fits in better than me."
585,585,1,Mark,True,17,"Gone, all the lovely power. Argh, might as well delete my spreadsheet of her coffee break times."
586,586,1,Mark,False,8,"They've screwed me, they've diddled you, at most."
587,587,1,Mark,True,3,"Argh, Sophie, alcohol."
588,588,1,Mark,False,12,"It's not our baby, can you stop saying that? Ouch, another one."
589,589,1,Mark,False,31,"Is it OK, do you think, to get involved? I guess a bit of one of us is on board. The baby is a bit like our embassy on her territory."
590,590,1,Mark,True,12,"Urgh, the first of many pub visits the baby's going to ruin."
591,591,1,Mark,False,16,"Well, we both know that's not true, so let's start with the facts, shall we, and-"
592,592,1,Mark,False,22,"Written permission, listen to her, she's exaggerating for comic effect, and it certainly has put me well and truly in my place."
593,593,1,Mark,True,10,You love me and you want to move to Norway?
594,594,1,Mark,False,6,"Jesus, you're kidding, is that true?"
595,595,1,Mark,False,24,"But we can't let them split up the team. I mean, you and me and, and, you know, Lisa. It would be a tragedy..."
596,596,1,Mark,True,7,if I couldn't see you any more.
597,597,1,Mark,False,4,We've gotta fight back.
598,598,1,Mark,True,25,"OK, gotta build a JLB life raft, haul Dobby out of the water. Come aboard, shipmate. Now let's get you out of those wet clothes."
599,599,1,Mark,False,8,"So I was thinking, JLB Survivors' Campaign Group."
600,600,1,Mark,False,62,"Grassroots, yeah, but with me as the chair. Or president, president or chair. Which do you reckon? Doesn't matter, we'll campaign, and I'll write a blog and I'll write to my MP. I might go on The One Show and I've got an idea for a rather savage satirical cartoon. We could do a benefit night and I might do a skit."
601,601,1,Mark,False,14,It just think it would be fun. I might do a skit with Dobby.
602,602,1,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh.
603,603,1,Mark,False,6,Can you please stop doing that?
604,604,1,Mark,False,9,"No, I'm sorry, you're not allowed to be depressed."
605,605,1,Mark,False,10,Because you're freeloading on my trauma. You're a grief thief.
606,606,1,Mark,False,9,You can't find your niche between 9 and 11
607,607,1,Mark,False,16,"Look, the only reason you're romanticising this job is that you'll never get do it again."
608,608,1,Mark,True,20,"Jesus, look at it. I wonder who the Prime Minister will be when I've finished the repayments. An unborn Miliband?"
609,609,1,Mark,False,12,The depression is here and my new sofa is a white elephant.
610,610,1,Mark,False,14,Please don't call it the creamy elephant. I think I'm going to be sick.
611,611,1,Mark,False,12,"Oh, the high quality upholstery is like a knife in my back."
612,612,1,Mark,True,17,"How did this happen? I woke up Branson, end the day humping shit cash-in-hand for Super Hans."
613,613,1,Mark,False,5,"Uh, where do I go?"
614,614,1,Mark,True,10,"God, Hans is my boss. Jeremy's probably my line manager."
615,615,1,Mark,False,33,"Sorry for the delay. While I was waiting for the food, I actually sketched out a potential invite for the JLB Survivors' fundraiser. This is just a satirical sideswipe at the corporate culture."
616,616,1,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
617,617,1,Mark,False,10,"Yes, but it's got to be cat because of purr-full?"
618,618,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
619,619,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
620,620,1,Mark,False,20,"You're over-analysing. People will be laughing so hard they won't be thinking about what it does or doesn't mean, Jeremy."
621,621,1,Mark,True,9,I've dropped about six social classes since this morning.
622,622,1,Mark,False,6,"This is, this, this, this is-"
623,623,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
624,624,1,Mark,True,27,"Argh, for once in my life I've done enough physical labour to merit a high-carb meal and all I'm left with is an indeterminate puck of gristle."
625,625,1,Mark,True,31,"Boss of the JLB survivors. Yes, probably a lot of organisations got started to bag pussy for their leaders. Charles Manson and his family, Henry VIII and the Church of England."
626,626,1,Mark,False,22,"Yes, Jeremy, I invited everyone, even Steffan Strauss from Frankfurt, though I doubt he'll be showing his face, not after my cartoon."
627,627,1,Mark,False,5,"You saw the cartoon, Soph?"
628,628,1,Mark,False,4,Did you like it?
629,629,1,Mark,False,8,"Oh, brilliant. What did you like about it?"
630,630,1,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, that's right, Soph, exactly."
631,631,1,Mark,True,20,"Yeah, I'm not gonna squeeze too much praise out of that dry old stone. Probably went straight over her head."
632,632,1,Mark,False,3,"Dobs, hey there."
633,633,1,Mark,False,15,Did you get a chance to have a look at my speech? Was it OK?
634,634,1,Mark,False,16,"And do you think I should call head office avaricious profit cannibals, or mendacious bonus junkies?"
635,635,1,Mark,True,9,"Exactly, I'm the boss, I am the boss again."
636,636,1,Mark,False,8,Tell him to turn it up to eleven!
637,637,1,Mark,False,5,That's a Spinal Tap joke.
638,638,1,Mark,True,24,"Look at them all, nervous now, that's natural. This is how Frost felt before the first ""That Was The Week"", or ""Through The Keyhole""."
639,639,1,Mark,False,9,"How do I look, do I look all right?"
640,640,1,Mark,False,4,"Thanks, I just need-"
641,641,1,Mark,False,59,"Yeah, I'm having a mini wobble on the moustache. What do you think? I just feel, I'm not trying to associate JLB HQ with the Nazis, that would be reductive. I just want to hint at certain similarities in terms of the unquestioning approach both power structures want their underlings to adopt. Do you think people will get that?"
642,642,1,Mark,False,11,"Maybe an Erich Honecker, a Bismarck, something a little more tasty?"
643,643,1,Mark,False,3,"Hitler me, Jez."
644,644,1,Mark,True,8,"I'm becoming the Führer, the Führer of laughs."
645,645,1,Mark,False,23,"So, what have we here, an ailing patient? But one who is delivering consistent profits, except for 2003. What on earth happened here?"
646,646,1,Mark,True,12,"Should have kept line for myself, she doesn't know who Barbara is."
647,647,1,Mark,False,5,"So, let the surgery begin."
648,648,1,Mark,True,11,"Bloody hell, this is great! I've single-handedly re-launched the satire boom."
649,649,1,Mark,False,11,They didn't seem to go crazy for the outsourcing IT material.
650,650,1,Mark,False,5,"I know, that was massive!"
651,651,1,Mark,True,14,"I'm drinking champagne, I've written and directed a hit play, it's the bohemian dream."
652,652,1,Mark,False,26,"Oh, God, what a ridiculous idea, that on TV! No, not without a lot of editing. It really is a crazy idea at its current duration."
653,653,1,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
654,654,1,Mark,False,3,"Oh, hi, Steffan."
655,655,1,Mark,False,5,Did you see the skit?
656,656,1,Mark,False,3,"Oh, right, good."
657,657,1,Mark,True,13,"I've gone too far, permanent marker. I'm Russell Brand, Steffan's lovely Andrew Sachs."
658,658,1,Mark,False,3,Has it gone?
659,659,1,Mark,False,2,That's great.
660,660,1,Mark,False,6,I'm really sorry about the moustache.
661,661,1,Mark,False,28,"To me, Germany is Goethe and Thomas Mann and Boris Becker, but it's, it's difficult to do a Goethe moustache. Did Goethe have a moustache, out of interest?"
662,662,1,Mark,False,12,"Really, that's fascinating. I'd like to talk with you more about Goethe."
663,663,1,Mark,False,4,"Oh, you're too modest."
664,664,1,Mark,True,17,"Argh, into the interrogation room with the Gestapo. Not Gestapo, just normal German federal or state police."
665,665,1,Mark,False,5,"So, what did you, um...?"
666,666,1,Mark,False,7,They're gonna give us what we want?
667,667,1,Mark,True,23,"They want to stuff my mouth with gold, lovely, chewy gold. I could pay off the sofa, I could buy the matching chair."
668,668,1,Mark,True,8,"Oh, that's good, he must have googled that."
669,669,1,Mark,False,71,"Thank you, thank you, and it is great that you could all come today. It's been a great afternoon and we've had a lot of laughs, and I'd just like to say about the JLB survivors' group, and the final salary payout battle, well, it's been a week now, and I think the time has come for us to stand up and say, we tried, we failed, and we're moving on."
670,670,1,Mark,False,55,"Look, JLB is a big multinational and it's served us all a great big shit sandwich, but what we've got to do is we've just got to eat it down. So let's go forward, conserve our energy, let bygones be bygones, turn the music up, and have a great time! Over to you, Mr. DJ!"
671,671,1,Mark,True,37,"Oh, great, the chopper's leaving Saigon without me again. Just get to the buffet, the safety of the buffet. If I can stuff my mouth with enough salami, I won't be able to answer any difficult questions."
672,672,1,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, great party, have you tried the baba ghanoush?"
673,673,1,Mark,False,24,"You worked at JLB for less than three hours. I'll give you your bloody money! There's your money! Fourteen pounds fifty, you happy now?"
674,674,1,Mark,False,28,"Are you kidding, I kicked off! I really want to hurt those bastards! I think the cartoon rocked them. Let me have a think about another savage pun."
675,675,1,Mark,True,17,Got to get Dobby back onside. The doors will definitely be locked. Time for a futile gesture.
676,676,1,Mark,False,4,Let's do this thing!
677,677,1,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, thank God for that."
678,678,1,Mark,False,10,"Oh, right, fair enough. I suppose we'd better all just-"
679,679,1,Mark,True,11,"Of course he's got keys, he's carving up the JLB corpse."
680,680,1,Mark,True,13,"It's the pass at Thermopylae. We're the Spartans. No, Hans is the Spartans."
681,681,1,Mark,True,27,"Hold on, am I a Spartan or a Persian? Fuck it, I'll work it out later. OK, what's the minimum criminal damage I can get away with?"
682,682,1,Mark,False,9,"Take that, our work here is done, let's go!"
683,683,1,Mark,True,8,"OK, there is a nuclear reaction under way."
684,684,1,Mark,True,34,"But I can be a cooling rod. They're the hard spirits, I'm the carbonated mixer. How can I distract the savages? Keyboard, apparent crusade for justice, reduced risk of RSI at home. Double bubble."
685,685,1,Mark,False,12,"I've got it, I've got the keyboard! Mission accomplished, guys, let's roll."
686,686,1,Mark,True,15,Why has he got his shirt off? Any excuse and he'll take his shirt off.
687,687,1,Mark,True,17,"Oh, God, got to respond. She's got a cock. Need to get a cock of my own."
688,688,1,Mark,True,12,"Dobby's hard-on's coming all over me. This is my dream, my nightmare."
689,689,1,Mark,False,3,Never foam alone!
690,690,1,Mark,True,46,"Oh, this is better than sex, it's easier than sex. Oh, my God, that wasn't my main photocopier, but it was a trusty steed when the main one was busy. Screw it, who needs photocopiers when you've got a woman and a high-resolution printer that scans?"
691,691,1,Mark,False,18,"Yeah, I mean, I've copied a lot of shit on this copier, but who the hell even cares?"
692,692,1,Mark,False,5,"Hello, Steffan, what are you-"
693,693,1,Mark,False,28,"Nothing. Well, I mean, obviously we're fucking everything up, and the fact that you're probably insured for all this doesn't make a blind bit of difference to us."
694,694,1,Mark,False,8,"Yeah, so suck it up, you douche bag!"
695,695,1,Mark,True,17,"Well, got Dobby, but there goes the Nazi gold. Back into the vault with all the Rembrandts."
696,696,2,Mark,False,25,"Why are you buying cat food? It's Sophie and dips night. Just 'cause it comes in a silver pouch doesn't mean it's a dip, Jeremy."
697,697,2,Mark,False,23,"Right. Yeah, she is attractive. Although, brown rice and Pop-Tarts, chamomile tea and economy vodka. That's a car crash of a shopping basket."
698,698,2,Mark,False,7,Me too. I guess it's fifty-fifty. What?
699,699,2,Mark,False,1,What?
700,700,2,Mark,False,3,The scuba squadron?
701,701,2,Mark,True,11,He actually thinks he has suave spermatozoa. He characterises his sperms.
702,702,2,Mark,False,23,"Right, I'm gonna make a move. I'm up for a nice bit of Laser Commando. I'll see you for the pain fest later."
703,703,2,Mark,True,33,"This is pretty desperate. It doesn't feel right being a laser commando in cords. I thought there'd be jumpsuits. There are jumpsuits on the website. Ugh, I suppose I better nail this motherfucker."
704,704,2,Mark,False,1,Sorry.
705,705,2,Mark,True,17,"Maybe this is what it'll be like after the apocalypse. Wandering around, depressed, shooting children for fun."
706,706,2,Mark,False,8,Dobby! I had no idea you came here.
707,707,2,Mark,True,10,Every other Sunday when live action role play's off season.
708,708,2,Mark,False,15,This is a nice surprise. I haven't seen you for ages. Not since JLB closed.
709,709,2,Mark,False,13,"I know, I could have called, I just wouldn't know what to say."
710,710,2,Mark,True,16,"Oh, too easy. This is like shooting fish in a barrel. The fish has shot itself."
711,711,2,Mark,False,3,That sounds great.
712,712,2,Mark,True,5,What's this mad fish doing?
713,713,2,Mark,False,11,I saw that advertised. I didn't think you'd be into that.
714,714,2,Mark,False,6,"How about Friday? Dinner, at mine."
715,715,2,Mark,False,1,OK.
716,716,2,Mark,True,7,"You idiot, Gerrard. Friday comes before Saturday."
717,717,2,Mark,True,44,"A new boiler. Surely the least enjoyable way to spend a thousand pounds. At least throwing the money out the window you'd see the scrabbling mass, the hate filled faces. I have spent a cool grand on acquiring the resumption of an equitable temperature."
718,718,2,Mark,False,5,"Twenty-nine degrees, are you insane?"
719,719,2,Mark,False,19,"No, it won't. It's either on on off. You set it, it achieves the correct temperature, it switches off."
720,720,2,Mark,False,26,"You want to try and trick the boiler? Sophie. That is your first glass of wine, isn't it? You haven't drunk all the difficult conversation wine?"
721,721,2,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Soph."
722,722,2,Mark,False,19,"I don't know why you're sweating it, dude. You should just ask her out, like I did with Dobby."
723,723,2,Mark,True,9,He's never dated. He just ruts like a hog.
724,724,2,Mark,False,33,"Sophie, can I just say... I know it's a heavy time for all of us, and we all need to unwind, but... dope plus baby, doesn't that equal career in the Argos stockroom?"
725,725,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, right. Sorry."
726,726,2,Mark,False,11,A paternity test? I guess it would be interesting to know.
727,727,2,Mark,True,8,Oh God. Wanking into a cup. The dream.
728,728,2,Mark,False,7,"Of course. Now, that's much more civilised."
729,729,2,Mark,False,1,Jeff!
730,730,2,Mark,False,5,You did it with Jeff?!
731,731,2,Mark,True,14,How did he get to be the grown up? I paid for the dips.
732,732,2,Mark,False,16,"Yeah sure, OK, I agree, and can I just point out the wide selection of dips."
733,733,2,Mark,True,28,"Thanks, science. In days gone by, they'd have had to wait to see what the kid looked liked, by which time I'd have set sail for the colonies."
734,734,2,Mark,False,14,"Ugh, I hate this boiler. It's too hot. I can't date under these conditions."
735,735,2,Mark,False,7,Does Elena have to come over tonight?
736,736,2,Mark,False,17,Can't you go to the cinema or something? I don't want to date on top of you.
737,737,2,Mark,False,13,Try and give me and Dobby some space. I need space to operate.
738,738,2,Mark,False,3,What is that?
739,739,2,Mark,False,27,"Right, making love from behind and them slapping the woman on the arse. Since when did that become the international sign of a mutually loving sexual experience?"
740,740,2,Mark,False,26,"Why do you insist on seeing the anus as some kind of human USB port, just waiting to have all kinds of hardware plugged into it."
741,741,2,Mark,False,29,"Turn down! Turn down! Obey my commands, Orac! This manual is balls. Can you turn it down? It's on twenty-three, and ideally I want it no higher than seventeen."
742,742,2,Mark,False,24,"No, you want it cold so they have to cuddle up to for warmth. Plus, frugality is very attractive in a man. God, Dobby."
743,743,2,Mark,False,11,What are you talking about? It's 7:30. What do you mean?
744,744,2,Mark,False,12,"Jeremy, there's some children here who want to have lunch with you."
745,745,2,Mark,False,4,"Well, yes it does."
746,746,2,Mark,True,40,"Yeah. Novelty golf date beats ironic sci-fi fun, Gerrard. Hard cheese. And we've already had four whiskys, so time for me to roll in my militarised divisions. Makes it much less scary if I think about it like a war."
747,747,2,Mark,False,17,"Sorry, should I have filled out a lunging application form and had it ratified by the FSA?"
748,748,2,Mark,False,3,"OK, that's fine."
749,749,2,Mark,True,30,"Oh, my God, she likes me. She just said it, that's undeniable. I can bank that. I can put it on a blog so it's a matter of public record."
750,750,2,Mark,False,1,Exactly.
751,751,2,Mark,True,44,"Yeah, we are Roosevelt and Stalin. Gerrard's Churchill. He thinks he's in there, but when the fucking starts and Europe gets carved up, Churchill has to leave. Oh, shit. No, Soph. Cancel, I'm cancelling you out of shame. Like my subscription to White Dwarf."
752,752,2,Mark,False,3,"Just, the bank."
753,753,2,Mark,True,9,The sperm bank. Where I bank my stupid sperm.
754,754,2,Mark,False,24,"Um, hi, sorry to interrupt, but I wondered if you could have a word with Hal and turn the heating down. What's going on?"
755,755,2,Mark,False,2,Your baby?
756,756,2,Mark,False,12,"Yeah, sure, but there's news? What did she say? Who's is it?"
757,757,2,Mark,False,10,It's your baby? Why didn't you-? It's definitely your baby?
758,758,2,Mark,False,7,Why didn't you tell me straight away?
759,759,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, my God."
760,760,2,Mark,False,16,"Oh, of course, we can talk. I'm going to help you through this, man. Shit, really?"
761,761,2,Mark,False,13,"Oh, you beautiful, beautiful, man! Sorry about all this. Have a great evening."
762,762,2,Mark,True,10,"I'm free, I can do anything. I can leave T-Mobile."
763,763,2,Mark,False,18,"Everything is possible, Dobby. The world is an oyster because we're young and free! Let's just... come on!"
764,764,2,Mark,True,5,I'm not having a baby!
765,765,2,Mark,False,10,Why the hell not! What's stopping either of us? Nothing!
766,766,2,Mark,True,24,"God, I think... there's no knot in my stomach. For the first time in twenty-five years, I'm free of a creeping sense of dread."
767,767,2,Mark,False,24,"Can we do the whole emotional splurge later? I can tell you how it'll might be a good thing, and buck you up later."
768,768,2,Mark,False,3,"I'm sorry, what?"
769,769,2,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, and now do your joke. What's the punchline?"
770,770,2,Mark,False,31,Then why the fuck did you tell me it was yours? Did you get mixed up? Did you mis-remember? Because I really think I would tend to remember something like this.
771,771,2,Mark,False,1,Why?
772,772,2,Mark,False,5,You total fucking shitting bastard!
773,773,2,Mark,False,4,Yes! Yes I do!
774,774,2,Mark,False,7,"I'm not going to fork you, Jeremy."
775,775,2,Mark,False,9,"I do quite want to, but no, too weird."
776,776,2,Mark,False,2,Your bag?
777,777,2,Mark,False,5,We are not equals pequals!
778,778,2,Mark,True,10,Bet he leaves that for me to wash up later.
779,779,2,Mark,False,1,Dobby?
780,780,2,Mark,False,10,"Oh, God, right. Wow, you're in there. All ready. Cool."
781,781,2,Mark,False,11,"Oh, God, yeah. Yes, absolutely. Yes, indeed. Let's do this thing."
782,782,2,Mark,True,16,"Focus, Corrigan, focus. Just for the next bit. Dobby now, baby later. Dobby now, baby later."
783,783,2,Mark,True,30,"Had to be ""baby"". Just don't think about it. Just relax and focus on the lovely enjoyable sex. Lovely breasts, nipples, intended primarily for the feeding of babies. Oh, fuck!"
784,784,2,Mark,False,4,"Oh, yes, so... fine."
785,785,2,Mark,True,27,"Yeah, now I'm feeling it. Yeah, lovely Dobby, and you can get second-hand cots. Everything doesn't have to be new. Mmm, sexy times. Definitely have the MMR."
786,786,2,Mark,False,10,"Er, yeah, um... Dobs, can I ask you a question?"
787,787,2,Mark,False,20,"You know, when you see those kids on Long Street in the nice blue uniforms. Is that a Catholic school?"
788,788,2,Mark,False,11,"Nothing, doesn't matter. Ofsted must have a website. Where were we?"
789,789,2,Mark,False,15,"God, yes, I'm very much into this. In fact, I think I might rubber up."
790,790,2,Mark,False,9,"Condom, yes, condom. Condom, condom, condom. Although, maybe two?"
791,791,2,Mark,False,16,"Two's company. In fact, maybe I should go for a third. Three is the magic number."
792,792,2,Mark,True,20,I've got to tell her. I couldn't slide this is in anyway. Be like trying to cling film an earthworm.
793,793,2,Mark,False,3,"I'm sorry, Dobby."
794,794,2,Mark,False,31,"The situation is this, Dobs. It's the heat! It's just too hot in here! I feel like my head's on fire! We've only just got the new boiler, and I can't..."
795,795,2,Mark,True,14,"Yeah, talk. Just keep up this covering fire while I retreat from the battleground."
796,796,2,Mark,False,4,Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
797,797,2,Mark,False,5,"Damn you, fucking, fucking, fuck!"
798,798,2,Mark,False,14,"It's too hot! It's too bloody hot, it's ruining everything! Tell it to stop!"
799,799,2,Mark,False,11,"Uh, yeah. Didn't I mention that Jeremy is having a baby."
800,800,2,Mark,False,2,Jeremy's baby.
801,801,2,Mark,True,6,"Mmm, the great taste of ashes."
802,802,2,Mark,False,4,"Ladies, talk amongst yourselves."
803,803,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, my God."
804,804,2,Mark,False,1,Fuck.
805,805,2,Mark,False,31,"Yeah, it's probably that crazy old guy that keeps ringing our doorbell. And if you answer, he tries to grab your balls and make you buy his rough guide to Barcelona."
806,806,2,Mark,False,11,Stupid doorbell man. He's so crazy. I'll get rid of him.
807,807,2,Mark,False,25,"Ha-ha! You wouldn't think there was much voltage going through one of those little suckers, but it packs quite a punch, let me tell you."
808,808,2,Mark,False,18,"No, it's fine. You just go and shelter. You find refuge over there, I'll deal with this maniac."
809,809,2,Mark,True,8,I'm opening the airlock. We're all gonna die.
810,810,2,Mark,False,7,"Sorry, Soph, should we do this here-"
811,811,2,Mark,True,4,Fatal decompression has begun.
812,812,2,Mark,False,18,"Er, right, yeah, w- what's going on. Well, sorry not to have mentioned this before, but Sophie's pregnant."
813,813,2,Mark,False,9,"Yeah. And it's, it's my baby, so no biggie."
814,814,2,Mark,False,12,"Well, no that's not quite- It's a bit complicated. Let me explain."
815,815,2,Mark,False,14,"I was going to tell you, I just didn't want to ruin the mood."
816,816,2,Mark,False,22,"But, the good news is that that's why I was so weird in bed. It wasn't bad technique, it was the news."
817,817,2,Mark,True,10,"It's OK, I'll send her an e-card. A charming e-card."
818,818,2,Mark,False,10,"So, I guess we've got a lot to talk about."
819,819,2,Mark,False,14,"Yeah, great. Just, first, Sophie. Do you mind if I ask you one question?"
820,820,2,Mark,False,8,Do you think it's too hot in here.
821,821,2,Mark,False,24,Yes! Did you hear that Jeremy! Sophie says it's too hot in here! So I was right. I win! Shove that up your bollocks!
822,822,3,Mark,True,23,"Oh God, the battle of the bulge. There's a baby in there, about the size of a croissant. A terrifying, life-altering croissant baby."
823,823,3,Mark,False,7,"Not sure, let it be a surprise?"
824,824,3,Mark,True,56,"Of course it'll be a boy, and he'll be just like me. It'll be like going through it all again. The PE hell, the stolen packed lunch, having to do a little dance and sing ""I'm a gaylord"" to the tune of ""Like A Virgin"". Although, obviously, the tune will be different in eleven years' time."
825,825,3,Mark,True,2,"Oh, shit."
826,826,3,Mark,True,3,But I'm unemployed!
827,827,3,Mark,False,3,Right. Got you.
828,828,3,Mark,True,26,"Three thousand pounds, Jesus! More than the boiler and the sofa combined. I hope he's clever. I will definitely resent paying three grand for an idiot."
829,829,3,Mark,False,11,"Oh, er, you know, good. Thinking actually of changing career direction."
830,830,3,Mark,False,12,"Teach English as a foreign language, import Pecorino? Something different, more fulfilling."
831,831,3,Mark,False,5,"No, no, of course not."
832,832,3,Mark,False,7,"Oh OK, I'll fire off a CV."
833,833,3,Mark,True,16,Loss adjustment. I could do that. My entire life has been one continual adjustment to loss.
834,834,3,Mark,True,66,"Right, Corrigan, need a job. You're a man with imminent responsibilities. So, really quick look at Facebook and a tiny bit of YouTube, and then I'll get a CV off to the loss adjusters. Shit, where's the whir? Oh no, oh my God, why didn't I back up? I'm exactly the kind of person who backs up! Thank God I abandoned Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs."
835,835,3,Mark,False,3,Bloody computer's dead.
836,836,3,Mark,True,2,"Ugh, hugging?"
837,837,3,Mark,False,14,"Are you OK? Is this ecstasy? You're not getting into ecstasy again, are you?"
838,838,3,Mark,False,4,I'm pleased for you.
839,839,3,Mark,False,39,"It's remarkable, isn't it? That out of the three billion adult women in the world your one true soulmate happens conveniently to live in the same block of flats as you rather than, say, in a village in Mozambique?"
840,840,3,Mark,False,3,"No, there aren't."
841,841,3,Mark,False,7,"He said a lot of things, Jeremy."
842,842,3,Mark,False,2,Isn't it?
843,843,3,Mark,False,10,Why take the risk? She might not say it back.
844,844,3,Mark,True,14,"Lots to go round, old son. I'm probably a couple of grams lighter now."
845,845,3,Mark,True,5,"Pick your feet up, Jeremy."
846,846,3,Mark,False,9,Morning. Those the same clothes you had on yesterday?
847,847,3,Mark,True,19,"Oh dear, he's having an episode. Should I put my hand on his arm? No, that sets a precedent."
848,848,3,Mark,False,1,Hastings?
849,849,3,Mark,False,6,You're gonna buy bread from Hastings?
850,850,3,Mark,True,1,Sussex.
851,851,3,Mark,True,1,Fewer.
852,852,3,Mark,False,11,I'm worried you might be going a- a little bit mad.
853,853,3,Mark,False,12,"Yes, I have! How dare you say I've never been in love?"
854,854,3,Mark,False,13,Just because I've never been to Zimbabwe to buy someone a fucking cake!
855,855,3,Mark,True,17,Lovely! Getting my computer fixed for free and sneaking a look at Dobby's bum. The dream ticket.
856,856,3,Mark,False,4,Tea for the worker!
857,857,3,Mark,False,6,"I done your twelve sugars, love!"
858,858,3,Mark,True,9,We're bantering! The sign that everything's absolutely fine again.
859,859,3,Mark,False,23,Arses! I need to do a CV for this shit job Sophie wants me to apply for. Anonymous desk flesh. Faceless office droid.
860,860,3,Mark,False,1,Yeah!
861,861,3,Mark,False,4,Thanks. How's that going?
862,862,3,Mark,False,1,Oh.
863,863,3,Mark,True,5,"It's not perving, it's appreciating."
864,864,3,Mark,False,20,"Talking about history? It's not possible, I'd enjoy it. I'd actually enjoy working. That's not something that could realistically happen."
865,865,3,Mark,True,8,"Pop psychology, but pretty much on the money."
866,866,3,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, OK."
867,867,3,Mark,True,19,"Good old Dobby. The anxious, self-hating man's crumpet. But probably best if I never, ever say that to her."
868,868,3,Mark,False,13,Of course he does. Whitechapel is almost entirely made up of Ripper walks.
869,869,3,Mark,True,15,I love that she knows it was 1888. So few women these days are Ripper-literate.
870,870,3,Mark,True,16,"He thinks he's Dick Turpin. He's a highwayman all right, holding up the carriage of history."
871,871,3,Mark,False,24,That didn't happen. He's playing fast and loose with the truth there. The only public executions during this period were at Tyburn and Newgate.
872,872,3,Mark,False,33,"Why does everything have to be fun to be worthwhile? ""Crick and Watson have discovered the double helix"". ""Did they do it on a skateboard? No? Well, fuck off then, I'm not interested."""
873,873,3,Mark,False,12,"Um, I'm not entirely sure you were correct there, about the hangings."
874,874,3,Mark,False,3,Print the legend.
875,875,3,Mark,False,31,"Um, I- I assume you're an out-of-work actor? Like they have at Hampton Court. An episode of The Bill and then it's nine months as Sir Thomas More in a maze?"
876,876,3,Mark,True,15,"OK, wow! Museum, lunch and a snooze. Museum, lunch and a snooze. The big three."
877,877,3,Mark,False,12,"Dobby, do you think you could recommend me for a trial walk?"
878,878,3,Mark,True,9,Ha! Thirty years of ignoring fashion finally pays off.
879,879,3,Mark,False,5,They don't make them race.
880,880,3,Mark,False,29,"Research for my history walk. A Mercantile History of the East End. I'm excited, Jez. Genuinely excited that this could be my actual job. Although, there's the Sophie obstacle."
881,881,3,Mark,False,31,"Exactly. She'll want me to take that loss adjuster's job, so I can pay for her to give birth on a trampoline made of marshmallows in a reconstruction of Greenham Common."
882,882,3,Mark,False,1,Past-oes?
883,883,3,Mark,False,17,"You're sure she's not exploiting you at all, Jez? You're not being treated like a love jockey?"
884,884,3,Mark,False,19,"Yeah, didn't you feel at all embarrassed telling a total stranger that you were some kind of extremist masturbator?"
885,885,3,Mark,False,15,Isn't it the usual dead-eyed men fucking dead-eyed women in a desperate world of pain?
886,886,3,Mark,False,21,"Wow. Four-way sex on a pallet of dishwasher salt. You're right, that is about the most erotic thing I can imagine."
887,887,3,Mark,True,10,A big old placenta-befuddled think. Here comes the marshmallow trampoline.
888,888,3,Mark,True,3,Must ring dad.
889,889,3,Mark,True,27,"Shit, there's nothing stopping me now! But can I go through with it? Maybe it's better off staying as a nice idea, like the Private Finance Initiative."
890,890,3,Mark,False,28,"This really has to be good now. I'm about to live the dream, but I'm scared it'll be that dream where I'm naked on a toilet outside Carpetright."
891,891,3,Mark,False,25,"This is it, though, isn't it? My big chance. I can start again and do something interesting after years of horrific dullness. Like Sister Wendy."
892,892,3,Mark,False,15,"Well, Holmes is certainly the guv'nor. But, I don't think I really want a costume."
893,893,3,Mark,False,7,"Yeah, he- he never really said that."
894,894,3,Mark,False,2,Shut up.
895,895,3,Mark,False,14,"Yes, should of course be a black clay pipe rather than the mythical Meerschaum."
896,896,3,Mark,False,5,An incorrect Sherlock Holmes pipe.
897,897,3,Mark,False,37,"No, look, I'll think about the pipe. But I just don't want to dilute the content too much. You need a USP, and that's mine. No frills, no wigs, no spin, just telling it like it was."
898,898,3,Mark,True,14,Shit. Have I...? I don't think I've cleared off the... thing I was watching.
899,899,3,Mark,False,16,"Actually, Dobby, would, would it be all right if I hung onto that for a bit?"
900,900,3,Mark,True,30,"Shit, if she finds it, I could always say I look at porn in an ironic way, to look at the moustaches and wallpaper. That's the usual get-out, isn't it?"
901,901,3,Mark,False,4,"Jez, mate. Big problem."
902,902,3,Mark,False,22,"No, not my balls. Dobby's taken back her boss's laptop, and I don't think I cleaned off the- that porn you recommended."
903,903,3,Mark,False,8,"Yes, you did, you gave it five stars."
904,904,3,Mark,False,6,I don't remember. I might have.
905,905,3,Mark,False,24,"Anyway, I was wondering if... if you could say, if Dobby does find it, that it was you who was looking at the porn?"
906,906,3,Mark,False,40,"Oh, come on, Jez. It's going really well again with Dobby. I don't need this. And, Christ, if Jan finds out I'm dead, tidy hair or no tidy hair. I just want you to take a wank bullet for me."
907,907,3,Mark,False,43,"Oh right, I see. So you'll take a wank bullet for Elena, but you won't for me. Ten minutes with her is worth more than ten years with me. Well. I think we can count our friendship pretty much over from now on."
908,908,3,Mark,False,11,I'm not a cock. But the cock has certainly crowed. Thrice.
909,909,3,Mark,False,12,It means you've betrayed me. It's- it's the New Testament. You cock.
910,910,3,Mark,False,17,"Thanks. I think it is pretty zhooshy, though. Dobby, er, about Jan's laptop that you lent me."
911,911,3,Mark,False,5,"Oh, you... you've found those."
912,912,3,Mark,False,6,"I know, I'm- I'm really sorry."
913,913,3,Mark,False,2,Right. Thanks.
914,914,3,Mark,True,23,"God, you're great. I would definitely go to Hastings to get bread for you. Fuck, I'd even pop over to Ostend for waffles."
915,915,3,Mark,True,40,"(I've lost three already. Three have wandered off. I don't think they went for the Huguenots at all. And there's Jan, noting down my failures and mistakes and idiocy for posterity, like an evil Boswell to my shit Dr. Johnson."
916,916,3,Mark,False,6,"Right, so how's it all going?"
917,917,3,Mark,True,20,"Of course it's not going well. I've got an audience of six, and three of them look like sex tourists."
918,918,3,Mark,False,35,"Right, well, this former Huguenot chapel was actually converted into a synagogue in 1870 for Jewish people of Dutch descent. Does anyone know what the trades were that the Dutch Jews were mainly involved in?"
919,919,3,Mark,True,4,"Oh God, a heckler!"
920,920,3,Mark,False,16,"No-one? Er, well actually it was the cigar and diamond-cutting industries leading a contemporary joker to-"
921,921,3,Mark,False,8,"This is primarily mercantile history, I'm afraid, sir."
922,922,3,Mark,False,34,"Yes, yes, he did. You're right, he did. Just over there, just outside Jessops, the camera shop. You'd have thought they'd have got a picture, wouldn't you? I'm sorry but have you even paid?"
923,923,3,Mark,False,14,"Right, well, you're stealing a walk. Everybody else here realises you're stealing this walk."
924,924,3,Mark,True,16,"This is a disaster. This is a massive pedestrian car crash. Sorry, historical rigour. Sorry, past-oes."
925,925,3,Mark,False,56,"Right, well, even though our friend there was in many ways a thief, he has brought me on to the next stage of the tour. Because, yes, ladies and gentlemen, the game's afoot! Saucy Jack is on the loose! His victims lie strewn all over Whitechapel. We must track this villain. But how? Well, that's... elementary!"
926,926,3,Mark,True,22,I've sold out. A little bit of me has died. But you know what? A lot of me doesn't give a shit.
927,927,3,Mark,True,5,"I don't like you, Jan."
928,928,3,Mark,False,3,"Wow, thank you."
929,929,3,Mark,True,4,Good old lovely Jan.
930,930,3,Mark,False,4,That would be marvelous.
931,931,3,Mark,True,1,Shit.
932,932,3,Mark,False,2,Was there?
933,933,3,Mark,False,19,"Yes, I'd, I'd absolutely be available, Jan. The loss adjusters application was just insurance. If you'll pardon the pun."
934,934,3,Mark,True,7,It was actually quite a good pun.
935,935,3,Mark,False,2,"Yes, please."
936,936,3,Mark,False,9,"No, Jeremy, you don't need to do this, really."
937,937,3,Mark,False,12,"I'm, I'm so sorry, Jan. This won't be a problem, will it?"
938,938,3,Mark,True,21,"Superb. That's the single nicest thing Jeremy has ever done for me, and it's completely ruined my life. You lovely shithead."
939,939,4,Mark,True,40,"Yeah, I'm walking and reading, sweetheart. You got a problem with that? Oh great, Elena. If she sees me we'll have to do small-talk. Could recycle my ""nice weather"" material from Mr Patel's but it doesn't really have a sign-off."
940,940,4,Mark,True,11,"Ugh no, I can't listen to her sex chat with Jeremy."
941,941,4,Mark,True,3,"Jeremy? Oh, God!"
942,942,4,Mark,False,34,"Hi, Jeremy. Yes, I got Rizla papers. Normal. I refuse to buy King Skins, it's like asking to buy a hypodermic needle. No, I did not get the lube. See you in a minute."
943,943,4,Mark,False,4,"Really, there's no need."
944,944,4,Mark,True,8,"Please, don't pull me into your emotional fuck-pie."
945,945,4,Mark,False,1,Right.
946,946,4,Mark,False,1,No.
947,947,4,Mark,False,5,Nicer for who? For you?
948,948,4,Mark,True,10,"Great, I'm the man who knew too much. Thanks, ears."
949,949,4,Mark,False,4,"Uh huh, that's right."
950,950,4,Mark,True,27,Should I tell him? Really don't want to. Is that because I don't want to see a friend hurt? Or can't be arsed with the massive hassle?
951,951,4,Mark,False,24,"So Johnson's invited me around to his new place. Not sure why. Could be anything. Business, pleasure. Probably just wants to shoot the shit."
952,952,4,Mark,False,2,What's this?
953,953,4,Mark,False,5,No. A thousand times no.
954,954,4,Mark,False,9,"So, everything going good with Elena? Do you feel?"
955,955,4,Mark,False,3,Uh huh. Maybe.
956,956,4,Mark,True,33,"Could wipe that patronising smile off his face with the truth. No, would be like picking off innocent bystanders with a sniper rifle. Fun at first but it'd quickly become a depressing chore."
957,957,4,Mark,True,24,"My God, is this Johnson's recession residence? Not much to look at but then apparently Sugar actually operates out of a refurbed AutoFix garage."
958,958,4,Mark,False,2,Hi Alan.
959,959,4,Mark,False,2,Oh. No?
960,960,4,Mark,False,1,Yes?
961,961,4,Mark,False,2,"Uh, yes."
962,962,4,Mark,True,10,He's taken a shine to me! He's singled me out.
963,963,4,Mark,False,7,"Oh my God, I don't know. Really?"
964,964,4,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, my only hesitation is I don't have any actual experience of management consulting. Is it-"
965,965,4,Mark,False,2,"Huh, great!"
966,966,4,Mark,True,11,"Finally, I'm being groomed! Up the pink-carpeted stairway to business abuse."
967,967,4,Mark,False,1,OK.
968,968,4,Mark,False,4,"Right. Smart, very smart."
969,969,4,Mark,False,15,"Ugh, Alan's pyjamas. Probably still warm. Under the duvet, nobody should see under the duvet."
970,970,4,Mark,True,6,"Wow, amazing! I'm working with Johnson."
971,971,4,Mark,False,1,OK.
972,972,4,Mark,True,16,I've grasped the Talcum Powder of Power. Could slip it into my pocket as a memento.
973,973,4,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Suze."
974,974,4,Mark,False,2,"Right, sure."
975,975,4,Mark,False,5,"Oh, brilliant. What is it?"
976,976,4,Mark,False,4,That's an interesting message.
977,977,4,Mark,False,3,"Right, typecast again."
978,978,4,Mark,True,30,"Builder's tea, I suppose that's middle class slang. We don't coin much slang in the middle classes. ""Pants"", ""'mare"". ""Ooh, I'm having a 'mare. This builder's tea came out pants."""
979,979,4,Mark,False,6,"Right, Suze says your phone's charged."
980,980,4,Mark,False,1,No.
981,981,4,Mark,True,12,"I made his bed and got his tea, I am his wife."
982,982,4,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
983,983,4,Mark,True,6,Two thousand? Two million? Two... pounds?
984,984,4,Mark,False,13,I suppose if I got an equity release on the flat then... yes!
985,985,4,Mark,False,1,Cash?
986,986,4,Mark,False,2,OK. Fine.
987,987,4,Mark,True,11,"Oh my God, I'm bumping fists. I'm in bed with Johnson."
988,988,4,Mark,False,8,"I don't know. No, I should be fine."
989,989,4,Mark,False,6,"Hello. Oh, hello. You OK here?"
990,990,4,Mark,True,8,Got to get out of the killing field.
991,991,4,Mark,False,26,"Oh, fine. The meeting with Johnson was just about starting up a management consultancy. So I'm definitely gonna do that. I'll see you in a bit."
992,992,4,Mark,False,18,"Yeah, I should probably leave you two alone to talk about whatever important subject you were talking about."
993,993,4,Mark,False,5,"No, I don't think so."
994,994,4,Mark,True,13,He's excited. He's checking out the sumptuous menu options on the SS Titanic.
995,995,4,Mark,False,8,So I take it you haven't told him.
996,996,4,Mark,False,5,You have to tell him!
997,997,4,Mark,False,6,What? Why me? You tell him!
998,998,4,Mark,False,5,"I'm not saying, I refuse."
999,999,4,Mark,False,19,"Oh, for God's sake. Jez, Elena has a long-term live-in lover. You're just a fuck job on the side."
1000,1000,4,Mark,False,12,I heard them talking on the phone a couple of days ago.
1001,1001,4,Mark,False,15,"Look, I'm not the guilty person here, Jeremy. You're shooting the messenger. Shoot each other!"
1002,1002,4,Mark,True,19,"Two thousand pounds. Oh God, the Halifax Top Savers account is finally dry. The last of the Corrigan millions."
1003,1003,4,Mark,False,2,Hello? What?
1004,1004,4,Mark,False,13,So it doesn't bother you? Her being in a relationship with someone else?
1005,1005,4,Mark,False,15,But Elena's betrayed you. How does it make a difference that it's with another woman?
1006,1006,4,Mark,True,10,If I'm a bran flake he's a slutty sugar puff.
1007,1007,4,Mark,True,17,"Ugh, can't really take more than one lengthy toilet break per morning. The downtime here is non-existent."
1008,1008,4,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
1009,1009,4,Mark,False,6,You want to know if I-
1010,1010,4,Mark,False,6,"I was on the loo, Alan."
1011,1011,4,Mark,False,14,"Oh, fine, I like them both. Which did you go for? Consultio or Consultius?"
1012,1012,4,Mark,False,4,How do you mean?
1013,1013,4,Mark,True,12,I wonder if Mrs Sugar's allowed to sleep in the board room.
1014,1014,4,Mark,False,16,"Right. And, as of now, Alan, how many solid contracts or leads do we actually have?"
1015,1015,4,Mark,False,10,"Maybe there's a connection problem. Alan, the printer's not connected."
1016,1016,4,Mark,True,19,"It's not wireless. It doesn't say ""wireless"", it needs wires. Shall I say, or live in his dream world?"
1017,1017,4,Mark,False,6,"Good, I'm sure it'll work later."
1018,1018,4,Mark,False,1,Where?
1019,1019,4,Mark,False,3,To get milk.
1020,1020,4,Mark,False,8,I don't think it's really about the milk.
1021,1021,4,Mark,False,3,I don't know.
1022,1022,4,Mark,False,4,"Oh, yeah, right. Soon."
1023,1023,4,Mark,True,14,"Don't tell him it's in my pocket. Tell him ""It's not in my pocket."""
1024,1024,4,Mark,False,21,"Although, I was wondering whether in the current climate it'll be possible to recoup such a big investment in terms of-"
1025,1025,4,Mark,False,1,Right.
1026,1026,4,Mark,True,12,Just keep nodding and smiling. Nodding and smiling like Colonel Gaddafi's psychoanalyst.
1027,1027,4,Mark,False,10,Where's real Elena? Aren't you cooking her a birthday breakfast?
1028,1028,4,Mark,False,6,"Ah, right. How's the affair going?"
1029,1029,4,Mark,False,13,"Right, great. I tell you what, shall I make us both some pancakes?"
1030,1030,4,Mark,False,22,"Brilliant, great. And one good thing is I'm worrying quite a lot of the time whether Johnson isn't totally losing his nut."
1031,1031,4,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, I look at him sometimes now and think, you know, ""has daddy's hat fallen off?"""
1032,1032,4,Mark,False,12,"Yes, has daddy's hat fallen off, and he's just standing there, naked."
1033,1033,4,Mark,False,4,He'll probably be fine.
1034,1034,4,Mark,False,3,You've been summoned.
1035,1035,4,Mark,True,22,"Show me the money, Mark. What am I gonna do? Is it gonna be OK? It doesn't feel OK. He seems mental."
1036,1036,4,Mark,False,5,"Jez, but why are they-"
1037,1037,4,Mark,False,4,"What? No, no, Jeremy!"
1038,1038,4,Mark,False,1,What?!
1039,1039,4,Mark,False,1,Uhm...
1040,1040,4,Mark,True,13,"Great, I'm the fuck-pie's pastry crust. I'm holding all the disgusting ingredients together."
1041,1041,4,Mark,False,12,I'm not sure I need to sink to washing up just yet.
1042,1042,4,Mark,False,1,Oh.
1043,1043,4,Mark,True,25,"Maybe I could juggle it? Johnson by day, Bandito by night. Rich Mark could give to Poor Mark. I could be the Zorro of myself."
1044,1044,4,Mark,False,4,That could be interesting.
1045,1045,4,Mark,True,14,"""Me n E goin bed at herz! kp Gail swet. Thnx, Jez."" Oh God!"
1046,1046,4,Mark,False,3,"Don't go, stay."
1047,1047,4,Mark,False,1,Why?
1048,1048,4,Mark,True,6,"Why? ""Why?"" she asks. Yes, why?"
1049,1049,4,Mark,False,26,"Because I've got one or two questions. For instance, delineate for me, if you can, the main points of difference between the burrito and the enchilada."
1050,1050,4,Mark,False,8,"No, I really, really want you to stay."
1051,1051,4,Mark,False,7,"Oh no, God no. I didn't mean-"
1052,1052,4,Mark,False,4,"No, I'm sorry I-"
1053,1053,4,Mark,True,9,"Great, the big triple. Uninterested, unavailable, and physically repulsed."
1054,1054,4,Mark,True,21,Maybe I dodged a bullet with Alan. I can take my two grand and head to the hills with the Banditos.
1055,1055,4,Mark,False,1,Check.
1056,1056,4,Mark,False,13,"Hey, can I get some nachos or margaritas to kick you hombres off?"
1057,1057,4,Mark,True,19,"Oh God, this is terrifying. Just me and the public and some laminated menus for protection. OK, here goes."
1058,1058,4,Mark,False,37,"Hi guys. Party of four. Let me show you to a table. I'll grab you some menus but first can I get some nachos, margaritas or something soft for the little guys to kick you hombres off?"
1059,1059,4,Mark,True,11,I improvised. I'm the Miles Davis of Mexican restaurant waiting staff.
1060,1060,4,Mark,True,14,"Uh-oh, skinflint alert. Uh, what have I become? It's his legal right, by God."
1061,1061,4,Mark,False,2,Hello. Alan?
1062,1062,4,Mark,True,4,Oh fuck! Oh no!
1063,1063,4,Mark,False,1,Message?
1064,1064,4,Mark,False,2,"Uh, yeah."
1065,1065,4,Mark,False,2,Hi there.
1066,1066,4,Mark,True,6,"Shit, daddy's hat is back on."
1067,1067,4,Mark,False,2,Mark Corrigan.
1068,1068,4,Mark,True,3,"Oh, not now!"
1069,1069,4,Mark,False,2,Sure thing.
1070,1070,4,Mark,False,1,Nothing.
1071,1071,4,Mark,False,14,"Yes, of course. I've mentioned that, I'm sure. So you're all set for menus."
1072,1072,4,Mark,False,10,"You know, it's just part-time. I'm still your wingman, Alan."
1073,1073,4,Mark,False,22,"It's great to meet you, guys. What sort of area are you interested in us taking a look at for you fellas?"
1074,1074,4,Mark,False,8,"Cool, cool. I'm just settling these guys in."
1075,1075,4,Mark,False,13,Can I get you hombres some nachos or margaritas to kick off with?
1076,1076,4,Mark,False,2,"Well, I-"
1077,1077,4,Mark,False,10,"Hold that thought, Colin. Hold that though for one second."
1078,1078,4,Mark,True,13,Just gotta cold shoulder the shit-munchers before I service the big swinging dicks.
1079,1079,4,Mark,False,8,"Nope. OK, right. Let's get into this mother."
1080,1080,4,Mark,False,5,No you're not. It's 8:03.
1081,1081,4,Mark,False,5,"Uh-huh, OK, smart. Super smart."
1082,1082,4,Mark,True,44,"Yeah, pretty good first shift. Sacked by Johnson from my dream job but on the plus side learnt how to professionally present a Key lime pie. What?! Is this some new thing? Harassment by flailing washing? Am I being mocked? OK, face my persecutors."
1083,1083,4,Mark,False,1,Jeremy?
1084,1084,4,Mark,True,3,Bet he's naked.
1085,1085,4,Mark,True,2,Of course.
1086,1086,4,Mark,False,5,"Jeremy, what was the... thing?"
1087,1087,4,Mark,False,1,Erm.
1088,1088,4,Mark,False,5,I haven't got a rope.
1089,1089,4,Mark,False,33,I don't own a rope. I don't own a boat or any cattle or any of the things that ropes are useful for. What the hell would you do with a rope anyway?
1090,1090,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh, sure. Climb up it using your strength."
1091,1091,4,Mark,False,12,"Yeah, I could haul you up using my muscles. Shit, who's that?"
1092,1092,4,Mark,False,2,"Suze, what-?"
1093,1093,4,Mark,True,10,I can give you a tip. Two words. Mental posho.
1094,1094,4,Mark,False,5,Sort of... but not really.
1095,1095,4,Mark,True,16,You might find that's changed a bit since he stopped wanting to have sex with you.
1096,1096,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh, he was down there but he's gone."
1097,1097,4,Mark,False,5,"All right, Jez. I'm coming!"
1098,1098,4,Mark,False,1,Alan?
1099,1099,4,Mark,False,4,"Yeah. Yeah, I know."
1100,1100,4,Mark,False,3,"Wow, that's brilliant."
1101,1101,4,Mark,False,5,Of course I'm still in!
1102,1102,4,Mark,False,28,"Of course you can trust me. All that crazy shit we've pulled over the years. JLB, Kettering, the marketing/sales shitstorm. We were always there for each other, right?"
1103,1103,4,Mark,False,4,"No, Alan, it's not-"
1104,1104,4,Mark,False,4,"But Alan, don't go!"
1105,1105,4,Mark,False,12,"He got it for the wrong reasons but overall, probably, fair dos."
1106,1106,5,Mark,True,17,"Dobby's new workplace. Look at them. Healthy, happy young people. It reeks with the stench of optimism."
1107,1107,5,Mark,False,20,"Hi Dobs, I just happened to be passing and I remember you saying that if I happen to be passing..."
1108,1108,5,Mark,True,9,"two buses here, three buses home, five convenient buses."
1109,1109,5,Mark,False,2,Cool place.
1110,1110,5,Mark,True,11,Wonder who's tried to jump her. He'll have had a pop.
1111,1111,5,Mark,False,12,"Look, I couldn't help noticing there's a Cineworld on the high street."
1112,1112,5,Mark,False,17,"And I've got all these credits left on my mega-pass. And I'm not up to much, so..."
1113,1113,5,Mark,True,3,I'm a guy.
1114,1114,5,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, friends."
1115,1115,5,Mark,False,2,"Well, yeah."
1116,1116,5,Mark,False,1,Dobby.
1117,1117,5,Mark,False,4,I'm having a party.
1118,1118,5,Mark,False,21,"Yeah, that's the other thing I came to tell you actually. That I'm having a party. Would you like to come?"
1119,1119,5,Mark,True,8,Trapped in a web of her own making.
1120,1120,5,Mark,False,9,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm having a party."
1121,1121,5,Mark,False,19,Yeah obviously it is only a tactical party. I'm only having a party in order to eventually get sex.
1122,1122,5,Mark,False,6,You haven't given up on Elena?
1123,1123,5,Mark,False,4,Oh great. Oh shit.
1124,1124,5,Mark,False,13,"It's from Sophie's father. His solicitor. Arrangements for child maintenance, visitation. Oh God."
1125,1125,5,Mark,False,10,"I don't want to stickle or negotiate, wouldn't feel right."
1126,1126,5,Mark,False,1,Yeah...
1127,1127,5,Mark,True,14,am I really gonna take his advice? The finest legal mind of his generation.
1128,1128,5,Mark,True,27,Only three hours to go. Three lasagnes to nail. Need another. Chicken lasagne? I've seen it on menus but only at those pretend pubs at the airport.
1129,1129,5,Mark,False,6,What the hell are you doing?
1130,1130,5,Mark,False,2,Right. Why?
1131,1131,5,Mark,False,7,But it looks like a crack den.
1132,1132,5,Mark,False,8,Because I'm making four different kinds of lasagne.
1133,1133,5,Mark,False,17,"Go ape? I don't want people going ape, Jeremy. Because there's a missing word, isn't there? Ape-shit."
1134,1134,5,Mark,False,16,Anyway I haven't got time for this. I need you to start assembling an enormous salad.
1135,1135,5,Mark,False,2,Puke points?
1136,1136,5,Mark,True,31,"Oh God, this could be a disaster. I want a night of edgy banter and tipsy indiscretions. He wants us all lying around in our pants flinging shit at each other."
1137,1137,5,Mark,True,13,"Oh Sophie, not again. I'm not having a baby, I'm having a party."
1138,1138,5,Mark,False,11,I'm thinking of doing a reserve chicken. What do you think?
1139,1139,5,Mark,False,17,"What if it's Dobby? Don't snuffle any of the mozzarella, my ratios are right on the edge."
1140,1140,5,Mark,False,1,Gerrard.
1141,1141,5,Mark,True,11,Tube up his nose. The tube is back up his nose.
1142,1142,5,Mark,False,7,You're the first one here. You're early.
1143,1143,5,Mark,False,5,"Not a problem, old mate."
1144,1144,5,Mark,True,15,"Oh, I'm in a love contest with someone who's one blocked sinus from intensive care."
1145,1145,5,Mark,False,1,Drink?
1146,1146,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, no."
1147,1147,5,Mark,True,11,She's not gonna want to kiss around the mucus duct. Nice.
1148,1148,5,Mark,False,12,"I'm just on lasagne duty. Well, I'll make you a weaky, enjoy."
1149,1149,5,Mark,True,9,"Might tell Dobby he ""came too soon"". Ha ha."
1150,1150,5,Mark,False,28,I thought it'd look petty and vindictive not to. And as a petty and vindictive individual I have to take extra care to not appear petty or vindictive.
1151,1151,5,Mark,False,25,"Can you help? I need to make sure Gerrard gets incredibly fucked. Booze, drugs, whatever, before Dobby arrives, just to be on the safe side."
1152,1152,5,Mark,False,4,You've brought a snake.
1153,1153,5,Mark,True,8,"Oh God, he's brought a venomous plus one."
1154,1154,5,Mark,False,6,"It is safe, isn't it Hans?"
1155,1155,5,Mark,False,6,But red is next to black?
1156,1156,5,Mark,True,5,Where is everyone? Where's Dobby?
1157,1157,5,Mark,False,22,"Oh God, our party's a disaster. Let's face it, give up, call a truce. Everyone can go home. We tried, we failed."
1158,1158,5,Mark,False,11,Do you think it's the food? Do people hate the food?
1159,1159,5,Mark,False,25,"You joke Jeremy, but word travels, word travels. No one's dancing. Let's try some other music. You've had your chance. I'm putting this on, Jeremy."
1160,1160,5,Mark,False,19,"Get one for Gerrard as well, a biggie! Dance a bit as you walk. Dance! Get the dancing going!"
1161,1161,5,Mark,True,19,Hope the party livens up before Dobby gets here. It looks like a waiting room for a budget psychotherapist.
1162,1162,5,Mark,False,7,"Hi sis, glad you could make it."
1163,1163,5,Mark,False,6,"Great, you've noted the puke points."
1164,1164,5,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, the parental agreement contract. Yeah, thanks for having a look at that. Maybe on Monday-"
1165,1165,5,Mark,False,2,What message?
1166,1166,5,Mark,False,8,"God, no wonder she's calling me twenty-four seven."
1167,1167,5,Mark,True,4,The perils of shuffle.
1168,1168,5,Mark,False,12,It's not mine. I just got it free with the Sunday Express.
1169,1169,5,Mark,False,3,I'm not Jez.
1170,1170,5,Mark,True,12,This is all his chicken coming home to roost. It's a roost-a-thon.
1171,1171,5,Mark,True,37,"Oh my God, it's actually going well. I'm an It Girl. I'm Plum Sykes. I'm at the hub of London's social world. Peaches Geldof and Gorby will probably be here soon. And the lasagne's a palpable hit."
1172,1172,5,Mark,False,6,"How you finding the lasagne, pal?"
1173,1173,5,Mark,False,16,"Thank you, I think that's actually the tuna you're on at the moment. Glass of bubbly?"
1174,1174,5,Mark,False,14,"Look at me, doling out the champers. I'm the greatest man who ever lived."
1175,1175,5,Mark,False,5,Good will to all men!
1176,1176,5,Mark,True,9,"Did I just say ""good will to all men""?"
1177,1177,5,Mark,False,2,I know!
1178,1178,5,Mark,False,28,"So am I. I mean, not actually but it's like I am. Only negative is no Dobby. If it peaks before Dobby gets here, I've wasted good party."
1179,1179,5,Mark,False,24,"What? Like, start a message and then be like, ""stop it Julio, grab your own cocaine, I've got too much tit in my mouth""?"
1180,1180,5,Mark,False,6,Your mates are loving the tuna.
1181,1181,5,Mark,False,17,Gate crashers?! They're just some men who forced their way in here and are eating my lasagne.
1182,1182,5,Mark,False,20,"Jeremy, they weren't invited. If there was no one here but us and them, it would be a police matter."
1183,1183,5,Mark,True,12,Of course he doesn't care. He didn't spend hours reducing the passata.
1184,1184,5,Mark,False,12,"It's finished. And er, listen, mate. Who invited you to this party?"
1185,1185,5,Mark,False,14,"Right, Mike. And which bottle did you bring? Can you please identify your bottle?"
1186,1186,5,Mark,False,27,"Look, you've got to go. You can't just walk in here and eat my food and drink my booze and try and have sex with my women."
1187,1187,5,Mark,True,2,My women?
1188,1188,5,Mark,False,45,Excuse me everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. These two gentlemen are party crashers so I'd be very grateful if none of you spoke to them for the rest of the evening. There is an exclusion zone around them. A cordon sanitaire. Thank you.
1189,1189,5,Mark,True,9,"God, she looks like she's witnessed a war crime."
1190,1190,5,Mark,False,14,"Oh, the humanity. Well, must be one of your friends. You deal with it."
1191,1191,5,Mark,False,17,"Not at parties. Who comes to a party and does a massive poo? Sort it out, Jeremy."
1192,1192,5,Mark,True,21,"He must be here, the culprit. If I give everyone my best Paddington stare, the guilty party is bound to emerge."
1193,1193,5,Mark,True,17,"Could be him. He's looking pretty relaxed. Dumped a heavy load have you, sir? On my time."
1194,1194,5,Mark,True,11,"Great, my party and I'm the Miss Marple of big jobs."
1195,1195,5,Mark,False,14,Can I ask you an additional question? Have you made use of the facilities?
1196,1196,5,Mark,False,19,"You had an appetite for lasagne tonight, but did you have another appetite? An overwhelming appetite for faecal discharge?"
1197,1197,5,Mark,True,33,"Oh my god. Could it have been? She was the last one to see the victim alive. Jesus, it's the crime of the century. I've cracked the Da Vinci code. And it's horrible."
1198,1198,5,Mark,False,7,I know what you did last summer.
1199,1199,5,Mark,False,30,"I know that maybe you think that now you and ""he"" have parted company, that you're no longer responsible for him. Well, in my view you are your brother's keeper."
1200,1200,5,Mark,True,24,"So cold. She's a heartless supervillain. Hmm, maybe Gerrard's a little too out of it. Be awful if Dobby's natural compassion came into play."
1201,1201,5,Mark,False,21,Dobby! No need to explain what the hell it is you've been doing till this time. Let's get you a drink.
1202,1202,5,Mark,True,23,She's here! But the party's peaked. Just got to make sure she doesn't run into Gerrard or the poo. The items of unpleasantness.
1203,1203,5,Mark,False,13,Are you kidding? It's petering up. And it's about to hit maximum peter.
1204,1204,5,Mark,True,6,"Oh my fucking life, oh God."
1205,1205,5,Mark,False,18,"Look at that, some bloody man has turned up probably from the council. You'll have to excuse me."
1206,1206,5,Mark,False,7,"Hi there! And welcome, what a surprise."
1207,1207,5,Mark,False,17,It's more of a sort of gathering that snowballed into a get-together and mutated into a party.
1208,1208,5,Mark,False,5,But I'm having a party.
1209,1209,5,Mark,True,4,My party's been pooped.
1210,1210,5,Mark,False,14,"Jeremy. Dobby mustn't see Gerrard, he's gone over the edge. Get rid of him."
1211,1211,5,Mark,True,12,Bet Archer never did baby negotiations at his parties. Or very rarely.
1212,1212,5,Mark,True,37,"Jeff and Yvette from my book group? What kind of mad social chemist have I become? Oh right, can't finish Atonement 'cause it's too dry, but you've got time to get fingered by Jeff. Very intellectual, Yvette."
1213,1213,5,Mark,True,19,"Oh my god, there's a twist in the tale. Of course, the butler did it. I'm so sorry Suze."
1214,1214,5,Mark,False,7,That might be putting it a bit-
1215,1215,5,Mark,False,13,"No no hold on, I was thinking about taking Italian lessons on Thursdays."
1216,1216,5,Mark,True,20,"I don't know? Easter and Shrove Tuesday? What's he- salad spinner? OK, that's not a bad place to keep it."
1217,1217,5,Mark,False,10,"No, sorry we don't mean that. What are you doing?"
1218,1218,5,Mark,False,12,But I don't want Thursdays. I want to parle Italiano on Thursdays.
1219,1219,5,Mark,True,29,"Brilliant party. Make mine a childcare and tonic. Oh great, reptile abuse. Others get raided by the police. I'm gonna get raided by the World Wide Fund for Nature."
1220,1220,5,Mark,False,3,The decent thing?
1221,1221,5,Mark,True,55,"Maybe I'd be happy. Driving the seed van around with my country cottage and my family. Reading the Sunday Times. It's so thick I could not talk to anyone all day Sunday. Monday to Friday, work and property shows and red wine. If I can just figure out Saturdays, maybe it would all be OK."
1222,1222,5,Mark,False,1,What?
1223,1223,5,Mark,True,6,Should I shake the man hand?
1224,1224,5,Mark,False,6,"Oh, that was nice of him."
1225,1225,5,Mark,False,26,"No, no, don't take him home. He's fine. He's just had a bit of a disco nap and now he's ready to par-tay. Aren't you, Gerrard?"
1226,1226,5,Mark,False,4,Oh for God's sake.
1227,1227,5,Mark,False,22,"The same cab? But you live in Catford and Gerrard lives in Balham. That's miles apart. It's illogical to share, it's crazy."
1228,1228,5,Mark,False,27,"They're licensed, Gerrard. Dobby is not about to get raped if that's what you're trying so snidely to imply. So let's just cut the bullshit, shall we?"
1229,1229,5,Mark,False,8,"Oh right, now we get down to it."
1230,1230,5,Mark,True,15,They're not gonna have a better time going home than I'm having at my party.
1231,1231,5,Mark,False,27,"Hello, yes, I'd like two cabs please. I need two cabs. One going to Catford. And one separate one going in a completely different direction to Balham."
1232,1232,5,Mark,False,4,What are we celebrating?
1233,1233,5,Mark,False,13,"If it makes you feel any better, Dobby and Gerrard are leaving together."
1234,1234,5,Mark,False,23,"Oh brilliant, so there's a snake at large in my flat? Suppose I'm gonna have to buy a mongoose now to hunt it."
1235,1235,5,Mark,True,55,"So now I have to flat share with Jeremy and a snake. Still there's a way out, Nana's cottage. The seed van. Could get a dog. What would I call it? ""Warwick Kingmaker""? ""Lambert Simnel""? Too arch. ""Former Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington""? Oh God, this is all too much, this is all too bloody much."
1236,1236,5,Mark,False,9,"Jez, I think I might have a bong hit."
1237,1237,5,Mark,False,30,"Yes, I've organised this whole party and I haven't had a single bit of fun all night. So yes, I want a bong hit. Light it there and inhale there?"
1238,1238,5,Mark,False,21,"Fine, fine. It's not affecting me. It's not affecting me at all. Actually, I think I am beginning to feel something."
1239,1239,5,Mark,False,7,I think I'm beginning to feel great!
1240,1240,5,Mark,False,9,I'm having a good time! I'm enjoying my party!
1241,1241,5,Mark,False,18,"Sophie, you can have whatever you want. I'll sign whatever you want, but I don't want a dog."
1242,1242,5,Mark,False,7,I don't want Carrington. I want... Dobby!
1243,1243,5,Mark,False,8,"Dobby don't go, stay here and marry me!"
1244,1244,5,Mark,False,6,Marry me! I feel fan- terrible.
1245,1245,5,Mark,False,11,It's still there! Where's the puke point? Where's the puke point?
1246,1246,5,Mark,False,1,Snake!
1247,1247,5,Mark,False,4,"Sorry, sorry, sorry everyone."
1248,1248,5,Mark,True,11,Gerrard gets Dobby and I get a pukey bucket of snake.
1249,1249,5,Mark,True,14,I bet you probably can get reptiles dry-cleaned. That's the world we're living in.
1250,1250,6,Mark,True,47,"JLB Reunion. I've moved on, I'm serving nachos to arseholes. God, she's huge. It's like Alien. If the alien was a human. Hmm, if I had to choose, would I rather an alien burst out of my chest quickly, or was heaved out of my vagina slowly?"
1251,1251,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, hello, Jeff."
1252,1252,6,Mark,False,11,"Yes, well, I've showered, actually, but corn oil is persistent, so-"
1253,1253,6,Mark,True,5,"Yeah, congratulations on my millstone."
1254,1254,6,Mark,False,16,"Right, yeah, what, you've seen the scan, and it has no penis, just like his father?"
1255,1255,6,Mark,False,1,Sophie?
1256,1256,6,Mark,False,15,"Sophie, Jeff says, he says that the baby is a boy-by. Is it a boy-by?"
1257,1257,6,Mark,False,2,Obviously not.
1258,1258,6,Mark,True,13,Probably shouldn't switch the phone off as soon as her name comes up.
1259,1259,6,Mark,True,15,"He's never gonna be a lad. Boy to geek to drone, that's the Corrigan trajectory."
1260,1260,6,Mark,False,13,"Oh, wow, a little male person. Almost makes it seem real, doesn't it?"
1261,1261,6,Mark,False,5,"Yes, of course, I know."
1262,1262,6,Mark,True,10,Totally doesn't feel real. Maybe about one percent realer now.
1263,1263,6,Mark,True,4,"Hate mail, in person?"
1264,1264,6,Mark,False,18,"Oh, that's very kind of you! A month and a half early! It's tokens, is it book tokens?"
1265,1265,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, right, wow."
1266,1266,6,Mark,False,2,Have I?
1267,1267,6,Mark,False,10,"Oh, right, of course. Well, that's really kind, Soph, thanks."
1268,1268,6,Mark,True,10,She's given herself a taxi driver for my not-yet birthday.
1269,1269,6,Mark,False,14,"Oh, Soph, it's early doors yet, we've a month and some weeks to go."
1270,1270,6,Mark,True,13,I can get to Argentina in a month. Argentina and a face transplant.
1271,1271,6,Mark,False,3,I like it.
1272,1272,6,Mark,False,6,I thought it was a joke.
1273,1273,6,Mark,False,11,"Tarquin Oliver Nimrod? Come on, give the little bugger a chance."
1274,1274,6,Mark,False,7,"No, of course not, just something normal."
1275,1275,6,Mark,False,6,"I dunno, just, Bruce, or something."
1276,1276,6,Mark,False,4,"No, no, not Bruce."
1277,1277,6,Mark,False,11,"No, I didn't mean Bruce, just a name in that area."
1278,1278,6,Mark,False,14,"No, not Bruce, just a name like Bruce, not even that much like Bruce."
1279,1279,6,Mark,True,31,"Ugh, I suppose at least if I take the driving course, I'll earn some naming credits. I don't want a child who sounds like a member of a decaying European dynasty."
1280,1280,6,Mark,True,40,"Ugh, I'm doing something I hate for someone who doesn't like me, in order to drive around somebody who, as yet, doesn't even exist. Great, I was hoping for a David Attenborough-type instructor. He's more of your chain-wanking, ringtone fanatic."
1281,1281,6,Mark,False,1,Um-
1282,1282,6,Mark,False,5,"What, shall I just go?"
1283,1283,6,Mark,False,3,Are you OK?
1284,1284,6,Mark,False,11,Because I can't drive. That's why I'm having a driving lesson.
1285,1285,6,Mark,True,16,He hasn't even told me which pedal is which! He's assuming an incredible degree of knowledge.
1286,1286,6,Mark,False,60,"Look, I'm sorry, but I can't drive. Maybe in your career as a driving instructor you may get one or two pupils from failed states like Eritrea where they have no licensing infrastructure, but basically already know how to drive. However I feel I should warn you that the vast majority are gonna be people like me, who can't drive."
1287,1287,6,Mark,True,14,That's a retro put-down. Or maybe he thinks I really do wear a wig.
1288,1288,6,Mark,False,4,Do you teach automatic?
1289,1289,6,Mark,True,26,"That's it, I resign, I give up. No more lessons, the machines have won. I shall take to the hills and live with the tree-folk people."
1290,1290,6,Mark,True,80,"This is the life. Bit of Shake-y, enormous plate of chips. And when Sophie goes into labour, we'll call a minicab. What's the big deal? This is a much more productive way of spending four hours than breathing in my instructor's second-hand Superking smoke. I could write a play in the time I'll save. Yeah, what's my play gonna be about? A bloke, a genius, unrecognized in his own time. Mark... Borrigan? And he loves, or maybe even hates, chips."
1291,1291,6,Mark,True,32,"What a car crash of a picnic. Gail and Elena's London friends, thin gruel. They must be half hating themselves for having to invite me and half despising me for turning up."
1292,1292,6,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
1293,1293,6,Mark,False,9,"Oh, uh, right, yeah, good, pretty good, fingers crossed."
1294,1294,6,Mark,True,26,"Not a total lie, there was an interview. I was interviewing myself for a job as a playwright, and by Jove, I think I got it!"
1295,1295,6,Mark,False,7,"So, how was the class? Pretty gruesome?"
1296,1296,6,Mark,False,10,"Jeff? What, why? To perv at pictures of ladies breastfeeding?"
1297,1297,6,Mark,True,28,"Fine, let him get on with it. I'll be fine with my high-fat foods, which will eventually kill me, and my play, which is obviously never gonna happen."
1298,1298,6,Mark,False,2,Oh yeah?
1299,1299,6,Mark,True,6,What fresh hell? Spock? Mao? Vandross?
1300,1300,6,Mark,False,6,"Jeff, as in Jeff? After Jeff?"
1301,1301,6,Mark,True,23,"God, I've created a father vacuum and Jeff has rushed in to fill it like some toxic gas! I want my baby back!"
1302,1302,6,Mark,False,3,You have... kids?
1303,1303,6,Mark,False,9,I don't think you've ever previously mentioned the twins.
1304,1304,6,Mark,False,4,How old are they?
1305,1305,6,Mark,False,1,Five.
1306,1306,6,Mark,True,30,"Oh God, is that gonna be me? Am I gonna be Hans? Super Mark, the crack-smoking Mexican restaurant waiter with a shirt and bow tie but no trousers or pants."
1307,1307,6,Mark,False,23,"Look, Soph, I just wanted to tell you that I was gonna step up with the baby. I'm gonna do the right thing."
1308,1308,6,Mark,False,40,"The truth is I'm scared. About the baby, I'm fucking terrified. I can't sleep, and I've got mouth ulcers and that weird stress things I get with my elbows and my bowels, well, you know how normally I'm like clockwork?"
1309,1309,6,Mark,False,25,"Well, right now I'm all over the shop. But the headline is that I'm doing this. I'm driving you in, and I'm wheeling you out."
1310,1310,6,Mark,False,2,"Oh, yeah."
1311,1311,6,Mark,True,13,Only took one lesson and had to pay to get the clutch repaired.
1312,1312,6,Mark,False,8,"I mean, nothing's guaranteed, not in this world."
1313,1313,6,Mark,False,25,"Of course I did all the lessons! What else would I have been doing? Watching the frankly overrated ""The Wire"" on DVD day after day?"
1314,1314,6,Mark,True,22,"Right, gotta try. There's always the slim chance the examiner will pass me because he's gay and inexplicably finds me super hot."
1315,1315,6,Mark,True,51,"OK, here we go, what's my plan here? Touch him up, let him touch me up? Would either of us enjoy touching the other one up at all? No, gotta be something else, some point of contact. He's a Spurs fan, a Spurrer? Could go a bit spurry, spur things up?"
1316,1316,6,Mark,False,24,"Oh, my knees are killing me. They don't give you much room for manoeuvre, those seats down at the White Hart Ground, do they?"
1317,1317,6,Mark,True,4,Pretty sure that's right.
1318,1318,6,Mark,False,61,"OK, here's the thing, I can't actually drive. However, for personal reasons, I really, really need to get a driving license, so I was just wondering whether there was any chance at all that you could pass me without taking the test. And then I promise that I'll take the lessons very soon, and become a competent driver. I totally promise."
1319,1319,6,Mark,True,15,And maybe he'll grant me a Nobel Prize if I promise to nail cold fusion.
1320,1320,6,Mark,True,17,"Of course she has a wheat intolerance, she's far too important to be able to tolerate wheat."
1321,1321,6,Mark,False,4,Are you all right?
1322,1322,6,Mark,False,11,You seem to be acting with almost genuine modesty and humility.
1323,1323,6,Mark,False,16,What? But you rescued her. Why would you rescue her if you wanted to kill her?
1324,1324,6,Mark,False,24,So? I wanted interest rates to fall to historic lows and they did. That doesn't make me the governor of the Bank of England.
1325,1325,6,Mark,False,3,You really couldn't.
1326,1326,6,Mark,False,42,"No, Jez, the absolute worst thing anyone could say about you is that you are a selfish, moral blank, whose lazy cynicism and sneering, ironic take on the world encapsulates everything wrong with a generation. But you, my friend, are not evil."
1327,1327,6,Mark,True,1,Shit.
1328,1328,6,Mark,False,2,Hey there.
1329,1329,6,Mark,False,2,"Oh, well."
1330,1330,6,Mark,True,10,"He didn't report me for attempted bribery, so pretty well."
1331,1331,6,Mark,True,12,"Get off my patch, Jeff. Take your flag out of my baby."
1332,1332,6,Mark,False,8,"Well, uh, no need, actually, 'cause I passed."
1333,1333,6,Mark,False,51,"Yes, with flying colours. It was quite funny, actually, because he said, ""You passed with flying colours,"" and I was like, ""What does that phrase even mean?"" and he laughed and said, ""Well, with a test score like that, I would have thought you should know,"" and then we both laughed."
1334,1334,6,Mark,True,9,Better put a stop to this imaginary interchange soon.
1335,1335,6,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, but it was great."
1336,1336,6,Mark,False,4,"Thanks, I'm really pleased."
1337,1337,6,Mark,True,16,"Month to retake my test, can't be that hard. Mum drives, the Hamster drives, Jez drives!"
1338,1338,6,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, listen, Soph, can I have a quick word?"
1339,1339,6,Mark,True,11,She is a bit adorable. Bit annoying. Right on the cusp!
1340,1340,6,Mark,False,21,"So, on the name thing, Soph. I'd be basically happy for the baby to be called anything you like, but... Geoff?"
1341,1341,6,Mark,False,3,"Great, Soph, great."
1342,1342,6,Mark,True,25,"Screw you, dickwad! He's my baby, get your own baby off the internet or by impregnating a woman with your penis, just like I did!"
1343,1343,6,Mark,True,39,"Gail and Elena's big day. It's gonna be thirty degrees today, I'm gonna boil in that morning suit. It's great being a wedding guest, you get to be an unpaid extra in the climactic scene of someone else's rom-com."
1344,1344,6,Mark,False,11,"Jeremy, what are you doing? It's six in the bloody morning."
1345,1345,6,Mark,False,16,"Oh God, have you even been to bed? Don't you think you've had enough to drink?"
1346,1346,6,Mark,False,11,"The shark isn't called Jaws, Jeremy, the film is called Jaws."
1347,1347,6,Mark,False,26,"Anyway, thank you very much, your phone woke me up. You know what I get like if I don't get my full eight and three-quarter hours."
1348,1348,6,Mark,False,27,"Don't be ridiculous, if text kisses were real kisses, the world would be an orgy. No, it's the day of her wedding, what are you gonna do?"
1349,1349,6,Mark,True,4,The untalented Mr Ripley.
1350,1350,6,Mark,False,5,You're way over the limit.
1351,1351,6,Mark,False,1,No.
1352,1352,6,Mark,False,29,"I hate to be negative, but you drunk off your noggin, me in my pyjamas, it doesn't feel like the ideal time for me to restart my driving career."
1353,1353,6,Mark,False,1,Hello?
1354,1354,6,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
1355,1355,6,Mark,False,18,"Oh my God! Oh, oh my God, it's early! You're never early, you're always late! Always, for everything!"
1356,1356,6,Mark,False,6,"Oh God, oh shit, oh God."
1357,1357,6,Mark,False,3,"Right, no, shit."
1358,1358,6,Mark,False,7,Isn't there anyone else you could ask?
1359,1359,6,Mark,False,10,"Um, Sophie's at Elena's cottage, she's having the bloody baby!"
1360,1360,6,Mark,False,8,"I'm coming over, Soph! I am coming over!"
1361,1361,6,Mark,False,19,"Just try and focus, I'm gonna need a lot, and I mean a hell of a lot, of help."
1362,1362,6,Mark,False,29,"Not like a dick, that's your driving instruction? Please, Jeremy, I need you to guide, to advise, I don't even know about road signs, what does that one mean?"
1363,1363,6,Mark,False,10,"Slaves did the pyramids, Jeremy. Thousands and thousands of slaves."
1364,1364,6,Mark,True,6,"Don't blame me, blame Ramses II."
1365,1365,6,Mark,True,9,"Great, I'm the fifth emergency service. The sex ambulance."
1366,1366,6,Mark,False,11,"No, no, Jez, absolutely not! No, stay, you've gotta help me!"
1367,1367,6,Mark,False,12,"Oh God. Oh God, oh God, oh God. How you doing, Soph?"
1368,1368,6,Mark,False,12,"Uh, yeah, right, OK. But, should we just, quickly, wait for Jez?"
1369,1369,6,Mark,False,3,"Right, yeah, really?"
1370,1370,6,Mark,True,16,"Hmm, kill my unborn child in a road traffic accident to save face? Doesn't feel great."
1371,1371,6,Mark,True,12,"OK, got to tell her. Got to come clean, take the humiliation."
1372,1372,6,Mark,False,1,What?
1373,1373,6,Mark,False,4,No need to shout!
1374,1374,6,Mark,False,9,"Shouting will not make me a better driver, Jeremy!"
1375,1375,6,Mark,False,4,They're having an affair.
1376,1376,6,Mark,False,2,It's complicated.
1377,1377,6,Mark,False,23,"There, you see? I've stalled again, and do you know why? It's because I'm nervous, and I'm nervous because you're shouting at me!"
1378,1378,6,Mark,False,11,I'm not going! Why's it not going? Why isn't it going?
1379,1379,6,Mark,False,19,"Normally, I wouldn't make such a basic error, but as you can see, this is quite a stressful situation."
1380,1380,6,Mark,False,11,"Shit, I can't find the biting point! Where's the biting point?"
1381,1381,6,Mark,False,10,I need to alert other road users to my intentions!
1382,1382,6,Mark,False,7,"OK. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre, mirror, signal, manoeuvre."
1383,1383,6,Mark,False,5,Of course I can drive!
1384,1384,6,Mark,False,8,"No look, no, Jeremy, wait! You're drunk, wait!"
1385,1385,6,Mark,True,12,"If anyone should crash and kill my child, it should be me!"
1386,1386,6,Mark,True,19,"Oh shit! I'll probably have to retell this moment in Crown Court, and I've already forgotten exactly what happened!"
1387,1387,6,Mark,False,1,Uh.
1388,1388,6,Mark,False,5,"Soph, you can't drive yourself!"
1389,1389,6,Mark,False,13,"Jeremy, we can't leave her. She's not safe. We've gotta go with her!"
1390,1390,6,Mark,False,31,"So, OK, Soph, here we are, going to the hospital with you. I'm right behind you. So, if you need directions, or tissues, or anything, don't hesitate to let me know!"
1391,1391,6,Mark,True,18,"Yeah, tissues and directions, good. Don't have any tissues, don't know where we're going, so... got those covered."
