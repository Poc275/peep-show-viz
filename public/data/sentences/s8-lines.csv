0,0,1,Jeremy,True,26,"Hans has sold out, a job and a suit, and now we're burning all our band stuff. Even the contract we signed with God on Mephedrone."
1,1,1,Jeremy,False,6,Are we really gonna do this?
2,2,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Dunno, Thirteen Bastards?"
3,3,1,Jeremy,False,2,"More, Mark?"
4,4,1,Jeremy,False,19,Could you please stop trying to kill me with flat packs? I'm on my way. I'm going. I'm gone.
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,3,Basically I have.
6,6,1,Jeremy,False,2,Cheers man.
7,7,1,Jeremy,True,6,"Not the bag, never Hans' bag."
8,8,1,Jeremy,True,15,Why didn't I get the job tip? We could have been the Chemical Toilet Brothers.
9,9,1,Jeremy,False,1,Jeff?
10,10,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, stocking up."
11,11,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Yeah, I've just got the feeling maybe I'm gonna get to finish these lentils."
12,12,1,Jeremy,False,23,"To confuse them. Fucking Nectar inspectors. That's why I got the denture cleaner, to throw them a weird one. ""Who are these guys?"""
13,13,1,Jeremy,False,1,Mm-hm.
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, I'm too big to fail."
15,15,1,Jeremy,False,6,I do know what that means.
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Anyway, it's cool. I've always got the ""Three-oh Walcott"" millions."
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,5,It is a good plan.
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,21,"God, I'd love to do therapy. Get someone's hands in my brain, have a root around. I just can't afford it."
19,19,1,Jeremy,False,6,"It's not with electric, is it?"
20,20,1,Jeremy,False,8,Really? Are you sure? What about the stain?
21,21,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Dude, I thought you were going to wheedle me for ages about the stain."
22,22,1,Jeremy,False,4,"I love you, Mark."
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,8,"I've seen it, he is a shit bag."
24,24,1,Jeremy,True,33,"Right. Therapy. What do I really want from therapy? A harsh, unremitting stare at the bare facts of my actual life. Oh, fuck that, he's eating a Twix! I can't take him seriously."
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Sorry, I'm Mr. Smith, wrong house, I'm not coming back, goodbye."
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, good. Yeah, amazing. Reckon I'll be cured soon."
27,27,1,Jeremy,False,17,"I don't really want to go into it, but we hit upon a lot of key issues."
28,28,1,Jeremy,True,4,Me and Doctor Bhaji.
29,29,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, er... no, that's right."
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, good."
31,31,1,Jeremy,True,17,Is he fucking me? How would he know? Unless he drives around in a Jeremy detector van.
32,32,1,Jeremy,False,1,Lovely.
33,33,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, you know. A... mixture."
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,4,You're such a bastard.
35,35,1,Jeremy,False,11,"You know, don't you? You know exactly what's wrong with it."
36,36,1,Jeremy,False,4,I'm not saying it.
37,37,1,Jeremy,False,37,"All right, I didn't go to the therapist. I had onion bhajis instead. You're the king, I'm a piece of shit. I pissed it up the wall just like I piss everything up the wall. Happy now?"
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,9,I'm a shithead. I need help. I need therapy!
39,39,1,Jeremy,False,1,Bullshit.
40,40,1,Jeremy,False,6,Bloody hell. That is so Gerrard.
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Mmm. He had a weak everything, to be fair, Dobs."
42,42,1,Jeremy,True,7,"Ooh, he's gone over the edge there."
43,43,1,Jeremy,True,23,"Hmm, he looks OK. Wonder what's wrong with him? Mistook his wife for a hat? Mistook his hat for a Child Called ""It""?"
44,44,1,Jeremy,True,44,"Mr. Bendicks, is that a joke? Maybe it's a test. If you tell him that his name makes you think of bendy dicks, he knows that you need the electric? Relax, just take it quick, and easy. Whip through a couple of my issues."
45,45,1,Jeremy,True,6,"OK, Mr. Bendicks, bring it on."
46,46,1,Jeremy,False,4,Want some Curly Wurly?
47,47,1,Jeremy,True,7,"Yeah. You weren't expecting that, were you?"
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,66,"Nothing, OK, I've heard about this. Harsh Freudian. I suppose you want me to sit here, yeah? Well, how about if I go and stand over here instead? You think you can handle that, hmm? So I suppose I can say anything in here. That's the whole idea, right? I can call you a dickhead if I want. Yeah, got a big dick for your head."
49,49,1,Jeremy,True,18,Is he going to get me sectioned? I hope he doesn't have a secret sectioning button under there.
50,50,1,Jeremy,False,128,"So what do you want me to do? Pull down my pants and fertilise the plants? Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you? Yeah, then you'd have a real patient on your hands. More mental millions for your high interest account, or ISA, or share portfolio, or to spend on your wife, or your boyfriend, chowing down on an Aberdeen Angus steak from your Volkswagen Passat. That's right, kemosabe, I've got your number. Yeah, doesn't feel very nice when the searchlight is turned on the searchlight operator. Hmm, yeah, pal? How about if I just pulled my knob out, and started wanking? Yeah? Oh, you'd love that wouldn't you? My gonads out, one ball dangling in front of each eye. That's your dream, yeah? Well I'm not going to!"
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Yes, please."
52,52,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Hey Mark, how was the funeral?"
53,53,1,Jeremy,False,5,"That's amazing, that's amazing news!"
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Mark, I love therapy."
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,12,"You should have therapy. He should have therapy, everybody should have therapy."
56,56,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Therapy, therapy, therapy."
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Mark, today is the day I worked out I am not currently a very successful musician."
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,20,"Yeah, I know you know, but now I know. And, now I know what I'm gonna do with my life."
59,59,1,Jeremy,False,6,I'm going to become a therapist.
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,8,I could therapise you. You really need therapy.
61,61,2,Jeremy,False,24,"Mark, mate, you do know that the more you talk about bathrooms, the more I feel quite strongly that I'd like to kill myself."
62,62,2,Jeremy,False,20,"Yeah, all right, no need to lord it, Armitage Shanks. I've actually got a very exciting new career lined up."
63,63,2,Jeremy,False,6,I'm going to be a therapist.
64,64,2,Jeremy,False,17,I'm a highly intuitive person. I'd make a great therapist! Look at all the pussy I bag!
65,65,2,Jeremy,False,29,"I found this course, Personal Invoicing Life Coaching. And they've got some great looking certificates. It's basically all the best things about therapy and self help but without the-"
66,66,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Unnecessary bolt ons, the extras."
67,67,2,Jeremy,False,23,"Yes, to show that it's for wankers in shirts as well as freaks with bum bags. It's proper, Mark. They've got a website."
68,68,2,Jeremy,False,11,"It's a week's intensive training, and then, bang! I'm out there!"
69,69,2,Jeremy,False,25,"Mark, if it looks like a life coach, and it's got a certificate saying that it's a life coach, then it's probably a life coach."
70,70,2,Jeremy,True,49,"So, who've we got here? The competition. Yeah, get your life coached by a failed supply teacher. With the easy charm of a nonce in a prison yard. No thanks. And, got your number, baby. Life coaching course equals non-judgemental space to meet similar freaks, for mutual hippie touching."
71,71,2,Jeremy,True,17,Fucking squares. Who's got time to read all the way down to the bottom of an e-mail?
72,72,2,Jeremy,True,7,"OK, here we go, hero or zero."
73,73,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Me? Uh... I thought... well, to be honest with you, I thought it was shit."
74,74,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Look, I'm not going to sit here and regurgitate a whole load of book learning"
75,75,2,Jeremy,True,8,that I have no idea what it is.
76,76,2,Jeremy,False,38,"I mean, yeah, I read it. And yeah, fine, but when you're in the head space forest, you can't look in a no textbook when you've got a three-hundred-pound emotion racing at your with its claws out, crying."
77,77,2,Jeremy,True,10,Of course it's quite true. I just made it up.
78,78,2,Jeremy,False,1,Hiya.
79,79,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, thanks."
80,80,2,Jeremy,True,13,Have they found some legal way to force me out of the flat?
81,81,2,Jeremy,False,1,Brilliant.
82,82,2,Jeremy,True,16,His book? What next? He's found a director for his film? A builder for his cathedral?
83,83,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Mmm, I know what you mean. I was working pretty hard today. On my course."
84,84,2,Jeremy,False,28,"I suppose this means it's all looking up for the el dude brothers. Or, J.K. Rowling and Sigmund Freud, as we should probably start calling ourselves. Eh! Eh!"
85,85,2,Jeremy,False,1,Eh!
86,86,2,Jeremy,True,16,"I could write a book. Piece of piss. Chapter one: the end. There you go, book!"
87,87,2,Jeremy,False,38,"Good. Great, actually. Did a load of great exercises. Pretty sure I won. Not that it's a competition, but it was pretty clear I was the best. Actually, they want me to find a volunteer to practice on."
88,88,2,Jeremy,False,1,What?
89,89,2,Jeremy,False,21,I'm gonna tell her what's right for her. We have a code of ethics. It's a professional discipline. There's a pamphlet.
90,90,2,Jeremy,False,12,"You can't be her life coach, Mark, you haven't got a certificate."
91,91,2,Jeremy,False,25,"All right. But I'm warning you, I'm only gonna do one unethical thing in my career. It just happens to be the very first thing."
92,92,2,Jeremy,False,25,"Mark? Are you stirring your coffee very quietly without chinking the side, so I can't hear, and you don't have to make one for me?"
93,93,2,Jeremy,False,28,Midnight coffee? You're not going to go barmy and start phoning up 5 Live saying you've seen the end of civilisation in the bottom of a bargain bucket?
94,94,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah, I know. You type like you're trying to massacre imaginary ants, swarming your keyboard."
95,95,2,Jeremy,False,14,"Mark, you're in caps. Looks like you've been in caps for a few hours."
96,96,2,Jeremy,False,11,I think maybe you should get quite a lot of sleep.
97,97,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Nah, don't worry about the spell check, dude."
98,98,2,Jeremy,False,27,"Nah. They all have a big spell checker, with all the latest words. That's what publishers are these days, spell checkers who take you out for lunch."
99,99,2,Jeremy,True,7,"Yeah, keep killing those ants, Charles Dickens."
100,100,2,Jeremy,True,17,"Private meeting with the tutor. Leave the life buses at the bus stop, I'm getting the coach!"
101,101,2,Jeremy,False,6,Great morning. You're an amazing therapist.
102,102,2,Jeremy,False,49,"Yeah, right. Exactly. Who can be bothered to get a degree, and spend four years moaning on about how your gran sent you to primary school with raw chicken in your packed lunch, because she'd mixed up the Tupperware boxes and you thought she was trying to poison you?"
103,103,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Uh... yeah, yeah, it did, actually. We laughed about it."
104,104,2,Jeremy,True,15,"Mixing up the boxes. Yeah, right. I know you were trying to kill me, Gran."
105,105,2,Jeremy,False,8,"So, um, any idea what you're gonna have?"
106,106,2,Jeremy,False,9,Just curious. I was thinking about having the burger.
107,107,2,Jeremy,False,4,I- I don't know?
108,108,2,Jeremy,False,22,"I mean, I was gonna order the burger, but now I feel like... you've got a problem with me ordering the burger?"
109,109,2,Jeremy,False,11,Because we're talking quite a lot about me ordering the burger?
110,110,2,Jeremy,False,9,Uh... yeah. I think I'll have the... halloumi salad?
111,111,2,Jeremy,False,1,Wa-ter.
112,112,2,Jeremy,True,17,"Salad and a water? I'm ordering myself a horrible lunch, and somehow also totally getting everything wrong."
113,113,2,Jeremy,False,57,"Actually, you know what, fuck it. I'll have a Coke. Man Coke, not any Wayne Rooney, hair transplant bullshit. And screw the salad, I'll have a burger. And a chocolate fudge cheesecake, too. Yeah, that's right. I'm ordering pudding before I've even started my main course. If you've got a problem with that, send out the manager."
114,114,2,Jeremy,False,23,"I know what I want. And I'm not afraid to ask for it. Look, I'm just gonna say this, I love you, Celia."
115,115,2,Jeremy,True,9,So great for a first date. Stone cold classic.
116,116,2,Jeremy,True,8,Afternoon delight. Nailing the course and the tutor.
117,117,2,Jeremy,False,3,You're the boss.
118,118,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, yes, you've got a grass skirt."
119,119,2,Jeremy,False,1,Mm-hm.
120,120,2,Jeremy,False,2,Oh... yeah.
121,121,2,Jeremy,False,2,I'm sorry?
122,122,2,Jeremy,False,7,Right. I- I am going for it.
123,123,2,Jeremy,False,21,"Sorry, it's just... by telling me to go for it, it felt like you were saying I'm not going for it?"
124,124,2,Jeremy,False,13,Right. And the severed dicks? The- the skirt made of... what is that?
125,125,2,Jeremy,True,19,"OK, my fantasy. What is my fantasy? It's basically just humping. I love humping. But... need something more edgy."
126,126,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Right, but how much are they paying you up front?"
127,127,2,Jeremy,False,5,They're asking you to pay?
128,128,2,Jeremy,False,10,Does J.K. Rowling pay to have Harry Potter books published?
129,129,2,Jeremy,False,2,Right. OK.
130,130,2,Jeremy,False,7,British London? Doesn't that sound a bit...
131,131,2,Jeremy,False,2,Made up?
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Just, um, be careful, OK, mate?"
133,133,2,Jeremy,False,13,"I tried, but it's difficult. Spirit crushing comes much more naturally to you."
134,134,2,Jeremy,False,20,"Your motto? You should put that on your business cards. Anyway, chill out. If you love something, set it free."
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,4,Aren't London British paying?
136,136,2,Jeremy,False,4,Mark! Two thousand pounds?!
137,137,2,Jeremy,True,25,"Oh my God, he's actually going through with it! He's cracking his nest egg and frying it up to make these arseholes a delicious breakfast."
138,138,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Mark, I can't let you do this."
139,139,2,Jeremy,False,20,"Go ahead, I'm sure they'd be fascinated but the mouse is staying with me. I'm doing an intervention on you."
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,13,"I'm gonna say two words that you don't want to hear, ""vanity publishing""."
141,141,2,Jeremy,False,14,"I just think you need to be realistic about your targets, aims and expectations."
142,142,2,Jeremy,False,1,Maybe.
143,143,2,Jeremy,False,20,"My course is a proper qualification! It's not a pretend book from a pretend publishers, getting printed on pretend paper!"
144,144,2,Jeremy,False,8,"That wasn't a career, that was a T-shirt!"
145,145,2,Jeremy,False,37,"I threw that T-shirt out months ago! You know why? Because it was tasteless. I was embarrassed to wear it in public. That's the Jeremy you're dealing with now, that's how much I've grown as an individual."
146,146,2,Jeremy,False,8,"So, uh, listen, what the hell's going on?"
147,147,2,Jeremy,False,40,"Everyone... everyone passed. Is it some sort of administrative error? I mean, Hilary, whose UKIP membership card fell out of her purse, are you really suggesting people go to her to get coaching? Is my certificate different? Is it better?"
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,19,"What do I get? A couch? Or... a conch? Or a cro- not a crown, that would be odd."
149,149,2,Jeremy,False,1,What?
150,150,2,Jeremy,False,28,"Oh, yeah? OK. Well, let me give you a little tip about foreplay. You were waggling around on my guy like it was the cranking handle on Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang."
151,151,2,Jeremy,False,12,"Do you mean, in a bad way? 'Cause of what I said?"
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, ""Mrs. Severed Cocks"" thinks I'm disgusting!"
153,153,2,Jeremy,False,19,"I was busking, I was vibing, you were cutting things off, I thought... hair! I mean, it's not cocks!"
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,6,"I thought there were ""no boundaries""."
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,30,"Limits, right. Well, I'm appealing. I'm gonna launch an appeal to the... British Life Coaching Confederation. And if such a body exists, then you're gonna be in big, big trouble."
156,156,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Hey, Mark. How's it, uh...?"
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, yeah always."
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,1,Mark?
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,26,"Mark Crorigan. But hey, it looks good, man! I mean, some of it's difficult to read, 'cause the text kinda disappears into the... the binding, but..."
160,160,2,Jeremy,True,20,"Every fibre of my being wants to scream ""I told you so,"" but I'm a life coach now. Sort of."
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,11,"I don't know, Mark. Maybe it's just one of those things."
162,162,2,Jeremy,False,14,Exactly. One of those things. Why don't you do a reading from your book?
163,163,2,Jeremy,False,5,"You can do it, mate."
164,164,2,Jeremy,False,13,It was a weird and uplifting night of recriminations and complicated legal debate.
165,165,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Water under the bridge, as Simon and Garfunkel used to sing."
166,166,2,Jeremy,False,20,"OK, wow! Right! This must be the only publishing house that looks like it could also do you an MOT."
167,167,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh my God! Usbourne, with a ""U"" and everything! He got my name right, Mark!"
168,168,2,Jeremy,False,12,This is amazing! Ooh! Stars! Four stars. What are the stars for?
169,169,2,Jeremy,False,3,Only four though?
170,170,2,Jeremy,False,2,Fair dos.
171,171,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Thank you, Mark. God, look at it! Approved by the ""British Life Coaching Confederation."" Fancy!"
172,172,2,Jeremy,False,10,No one will ever know! I can't be found out!
173,173,2,Jeremy,False,2,Come on!
174,174,2,Jeremy,False,14,"No! That would be impossible! Come on, mate. I'm life-coaching you out of here."
175,175,3,Jeremy,False,13,"And if anyone tries to move from the seating plan, I'll taser them."
176,176,3,Jeremy,False,19,"I've got a website opportunity, actually. Super Hans has sorted us out a website, and get this, it's empty."
177,177,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Yeah, he's wangled us a website for us to do shit on. Business, creative, whatever. Totally blank. Big opportunity. You in?"
178,178,3,Jeremy,False,15,"I mean to say, you know, cut him some slack. He was in the Beatles..."
179,179,3,Jeremy,False,49,"I've always suspected that getting on a positive track is a good idea. But now I'm a professional life coach, I can confirm, you know, medically, that it is a good idea. You know, if you ever want to speak to anyone, I am a fully qualified life coach."
180,180,3,Jeremy,False,1,Cool.
181,181,3,Jeremy,True,33,"Is it OK, the bed? Is it a bit like, at any moment, I might jump on him and hump him better? I could hump him. I wonder if I'll hump many clients."
182,182,3,Jeremy,False,8,"OK. So, what seems to be stopping you?"
183,183,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Well, quit your job."
184,184,3,Jeremy,False,6,Definitely. You gotta follow your dream.
185,185,3,Jeremy,True,3,"Case closed, next."
186,186,3,Jeremy,False,1,OK.
187,187,3,Jeremy,True,7,Might have a poke about a bit.
188,188,3,Jeremy,False,6,How are things in the relationship?
189,189,3,Jeremy,False,5,"No, right, of course not."
190,190,3,Jeremy,True,6,Can I get into the bedroom?
191,191,3,Jeremy,False,9,Tell me about the sexual side of the relationship.
192,192,3,Jeremy,True,22,"This is great. I can ask him anything I want 'cause I'm the professional, and he's the worm in the science beaker."
193,193,3,Jeremy,False,2,Go on.
194,194,3,Jeremy,True,6,"Course you do, you filthy bastard."
195,195,3,Jeremy,False,5,"There's no judgment here, Neil."
196,196,3,Jeremy,True,4,"Ooh, tell me more."
197,197,3,Jeremy,False,11,"So, in the relationship, do you think you're getting really fulfilled?"
198,198,3,Jeremy,False,12,We don't need to go into that. That's not part of it.
199,199,3,Jeremy,False,21,"I'll tell you what's part of it. Now, tell me more about these gay feelings. They sound interesting, I mean, important."
200,200,3,Jeremy,False,15,"I mean, everything's connected. Um, a relationship, it, er- well, a relationship, it has some-"
201,201,3,Jeremy,True,5,where am I going here?
202,202,3,Jeremy,False,21,A relationship is a lot like a real ship. It needs to be moving forward. It needs to be properly maintained.
203,203,3,Jeremy,True,7,He gets that? I'm a life coach!
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,11,"If you sometimes want to do something, you should do it."
205,205,3,Jeremy,False,22,Yes. What you sometimes think you should do is what you should do. That's at the very core of the Usbourne philosophy.
206,206,3,Jeremy,True,8,"Kiss my cheeks, Dr. Freud. I'm on fire."
207,207,3,Jeremy,True,9,That's not my fault. I was definitely on fire.
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,13,"So, Neil broke up with Alice. She's in tears in Crofton Park, apparently."
209,209,3,Jeremy,False,12,It was his idea. I just encouraged him to believe in himself.
210,210,3,Jeremy,True,2,"Oh, shit."
211,211,3,Jeremy,False,9,You want to book in a session next week?
212,212,3,Jeremy,False,1,Uh-huh.
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Sorry, dude, but you're kind of harshing my mellow."
214,214,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Yeah, I feel for you, but I'm off the clock."
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Park it, Neil. Save it till... I don't know, Wednesday?"
216,216,3,Jeremy,False,3,The Chemical Brothers.
217,217,3,Jeremy,False,2,Flaming Lips.
218,218,3,Jeremy,False,2,LCD Soundsystem.
219,219,3,Jeremy,False,1,Pavement.
220,220,3,Jeremy,False,2,Lily Allen.
221,221,3,Jeremy,False,2,Foo Fighters.
222,222,3,Jeremy,False,3,Mumford and Sons.
223,223,3,Jeremy,True,18,"I'm so good at this, but I bet not one person here is gonna give me a blowjob."
224,224,3,Jeremy,False,4,They found some dope?
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,5,"You shouldn't hate yourself, man."
226,226,3,Jeremy,False,2,I'm not.
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,3,"All right, Neil?"
228,228,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Great. Well, that's clearly all part of your particular process, so well done. That's all normal and good."
229,229,3,Jeremy,True,1,Possibly.
230,230,3,Jeremy,False,2,Death hunt?
231,231,3,Jeremy,True,9,"Mmm, the death hunt. That sounds relaxing and fun."
232,232,3,Jeremy,True,5,"By that, she means me."
233,233,3,Jeremy,False,35,"Why does there have to be a death hunt, Mark? Why does war even exist? Why can't we all just have a game of footie like how England beat Germany for the first world war?"
234,234,3,Jeremy,False,9,Is this allowed? Just run away from the war?
235,235,3,Jeremy,False,16,They were forming a kill squad 'cause of Alice. Kill squad. That's not a nice squad.
236,236,3,Jeremy,False,39,"That was my hunch, 'cause, you know, well, I'm bound by strict confidentiality, but I think it's OK to tell you because you know him a bit. Neil likes to get handcuffed and then pulled off with gloves on."
237,237,3,Jeremy,False,28,"Yeah. This is all confidential, and I wouldn't be telling you unless it was interesting. That would be unprofessional, but she wouldn't wear the gloves even at Christmas."
238,238,3,Jeremy,False,5,Can you keep a secret?
239,239,3,Jeremy,False,16,He sucked a guy off at college and thinks he might want to do it again.
240,240,3,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
241,241,3,Jeremy,True,19,What was the football coaching thing? There was something about his job. He really liked his job or something.
242,242,3,Jeremy,False,9,"I really think I've said enough, to be honest."
243,243,3,Jeremy,False,23,"And if I was gay, why would I want to bum her? That doesn't even make sense. Taste my logic gun, bitch man."
244,244,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Yeah, Hitler put the bad vibe on the bunker party, like he did with so much else."
245,245,3,Jeremy,False,16,"It's cool. I am a professional life coach, remember. Everything you say will be strictly confidential."
246,246,3,Jeremy,True,36,"Well, I hate living with him, but I never want it to end. Why is that? Is it like the Stockholm syndrome where you want to go and live in Stockholm with a dick or something?"
247,247,3,Jeremy,False,3,"No, obviously, no."
248,248,3,Jeremy,True,10,She's asking for it. She's begging for... a life coaching.
249,249,3,Jeremy,False,9,How are you feeling about moving in with him?
250,250,3,Jeremy,True,2,Keep going.
251,251,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, yeah."
252,252,3,Jeremy,True,11,Fun means good at sex. Everyone knows that. Basic life coaching.
253,253,3,Jeremy,False,12,"I think the truth is, basically, I've been bored ever since 9/11."
254,254,3,Jeremy,False,46,"I mean, I was watching the news with Mark the other day, and he was like, all up in my grill about the Euro. And I was like, ""Ooh, the Italians might leave the Euro, big wow."" It's not exactly planes smashing into buildings, is it?"
255,255,3,Jeremy,False,17,"It was amazing news. You know, in terms of events and consequences, it was just huge news."
256,256,3,Jeremy,False,10,"They set their standards too high with 9/11, the news."
257,257,3,Jeremy,False,1,Exactly.
258,258,3,Jeremy,True,10,"I love you. Holy fuck, where did that come from?"
259,259,3,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
260,260,3,Jeremy,True,24,"Get your dobbin out of her noggin. There's a queue here. Mark, me, dead Gerrard, then you at the very back of the queue."
261,261,3,Jeremy,False,23,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just thinking about... how weird it is that things, and also people, er, can sometimes be... di- different."
262,262,3,Jeremy,True,30,"This is bad. I've done a lot of bad shit, but falling in love with her is the worst, or at least the most recent, bad thing I've ever done."
263,263,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Great, and if it doesn't work out, just move in with me. Ha! Just joking, just a stupid joke about something that wouldn't happen."
264,264,3,Jeremy,False,2,I know.
265,265,3,Jeremy,False,41,"Cause we'd be doing it, and doing it, and doing it, and then have a doobie, and then do it, and watch TV, and then maybe we'd have dinner, and just fuck the world, and that would be our whole thing."
266,266,3,Jeremy,True,7,"Easy, Romeo. Lay off the doing it."
267,267,3,Jeremy,False,3,"No! Oh, fuck."
268,268,3,Jeremy,True,19,"Yeah, I'm a double agent. I'm James Bond, and I'm gonna get some ointment rubbed on my swollen scrotum."
269,269,3,Jeremy,True,6,I'm about to be hit? Correct.
270,270,4,Jeremy,True,7,So I could stare at your girlfriend.
271,271,4,Jeremy,False,7,Big Mad Andy's started painting the kitchen.
272,272,4,Jeremy,False,6,So do you need another coffee?
273,273,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh, fine, well, I'll walk with you, 'cause I need to go to- that direction."
274,274,4,Jeremy,True,27,"Mustn't be in love with you, you're Mark's. It'd be like a weird sort of incest. Although to be fair, even normal incest is pretty fucked up."
275,275,4,Jeremy,False,1,Bye.
276,276,4,Jeremy,False,6,"So, are you gonna go interrailing?"
277,277,4,Jeremy,True,12,"She doesn't want your boring cheddar. She wants my veiny, intriguing Stilton."
278,278,4,Jeremy,False,9,Isn't he a sweetie? What do you think Hans?
279,279,4,Jeremy,False,1,OK-
280,280,4,Jeremy,False,7,hold that thought. Back in a sec.
281,281,4,Jeremy,False,16,Andy's my new life coaching client. He's got so many issues. He's a genuine gold-plated maniac.
282,282,4,Jeremy,False,8,I've got medical training. I've got a certificate.
283,283,4,Jeremy,False,8,"In a way, aren't all so-called ""qualifications"" meaningless?"
284,284,4,Jeremy,False,27,"Andy's the most mental man I've ever met. He punches people after he's had too many, but really he wants to get punched. He hates himself, fascinating."
285,285,4,Jeremy,False,4,Your secret learning thing.
286,286,4,Jeremy,False,12,Coffee? I used Mark's nice stuff that he thinks he's got hidden.
287,287,4,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh. Sort of, fine. I'd quite like him to go home now though. But he's vulnerable and, you know, a violent drunk, so..."
288,288,4,Jeremy,True,26,I have to stop being in love with you. I've got to find your flaws. You can't be as completely and utterly ideal as you seem.
289,289,4,Jeremy,False,9,"They really are. I hate bees, too. Stupid bees."
290,290,4,Jeremy,True,20,"OK, huge compatibility on the bee issue there, but I bet we're actually incredibly different in loads of other ways."
291,291,4,Jeremy,False,7,What do you think of Venetian Snares?
292,292,4,Jeremy,False,7,"I do, you're completely correct. Nice analogy."
293,293,4,Jeremy,True,10,"Shit, please don't be perfect. Please don't be the one."
294,294,4,Jeremy,False,6,Better get back to my patient.
295,295,4,Jeremy,True,8,"Here we go, back to the maniac grindstone."
296,296,4,Jeremy,False,4,You all right mate?
297,297,4,Jeremy,True,5,As a bottle of twats.
298,298,4,Jeremy,False,20,"No, not at all, no. You've just got some challenging behaviour and issues around punching and we're working through those."
299,299,4,Jeremy,True,6,"Is this good? Collapsing, positive collapsing?"
300,300,4,Jeremy,False,31,"Yeah. Yeah, he's just letting it all out. Crying's good. He'll stop in a minute and feel a lot better. Do you fancy a Twix? There's two Twixes in the fridge."
301,301,4,Jeremy,True,11,"Yes, she's not perfect for me, because I fucking adore Twixes."
302,302,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Andy. I know you're working through a lot of stuff right now, but can I just get the Twixes?"
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Not with the decorating. But, in terms of his mental health, he's really nailing his demons."
304,304,4,Jeremy,False,7,How was your business thing last night?
305,305,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Ooh, what's the goss, girlfriend?"
306,306,4,Jeremy,False,11,"What, bringing dull workaholics together to spare the rest of humankind?"
307,307,4,Jeremy,True,2,Is this...
308,308,4,Jeremy,False,4,Do you fancy her?
309,309,4,Jeremy,False,6,"OK, one word of advice here-"
310,310,4,Jeremy,False,28,"No. No, Mark. The advice is fuck and suck. Go for it. I've always thought you needed an older woman to sort you out. Like a sexy auntie."
311,311,4,Jeremy,False,15,"I bet she is. Just dive in man. ""Gather ye pearls while the hog walks."""
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Yes, no. I mean, just do it. Pull your pants down and put it in her."
313,313,4,Jeremy,False,9,"I mean it, pants down and stick it in."
314,314,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Hello, Mark."
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,7,"I'm Jeremy, Mark's oldest and closest friend."
316,316,4,Jeremy,True,22,"Time to stab my friend in the back like Judas. Out of all the main Jesus helpers, he was the sexy one."
317,317,4,Jeremy,False,17,"She's a hottie, a real hot banana. Pants down Mark, stick it in, that remains my advice."
318,318,4,Jeremy,False,20,"Seriously, I've known her for literally four seconds and I really think she might be better for you than Dobby."
319,319,4,Jeremy,True,22,"This is brilliant. It's like all my Christmases - apart from the last few, which were horrible - have come at once."
320,320,4,Jeremy,False,29,Entering his territory. Gives him more confidence to share. He's got a family party tonight. His ex will be there. I am life-coaching the living fuck out of him.
321,321,4,Jeremy,False,30,"You don't think I can do this, do you? Well, I can Mark. I'm gonna save this guy and when I do, I will expect a huge apology from you."
322,322,4,Jeremy,False,18,Have you been doing your breathing exercises? And taking Rescue Remedy? You might be low on zinc. Sorry.
323,323,4,Jeremy,False,5,Do the business more like!
324,324,4,Jeremy,False,20,"10-4 good buddy. Text me tonight if things get heavy, in case I need to spin Dobby a bigger lie."
325,325,4,Jeremy,True,18,"As soon as Mark texts that he's gonna get dirty with Stephanie, I'll tell Dobby I love her."
326,326,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Er, yeah. Maybe a bit weird."
327,327,4,Jeremy,True,34,What if he forgets to text? What if they get down to it before he has the chance? Fuck it. I'm gonna tell Dobby now that I love her. That I properly love her.
328,328,4,Jeremy,False,2,Hey Dobs.
329,329,4,Jeremy,False,7,Umm... here's an odd thing. Excuse me.
330,330,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Hi, Andy?"
331,331,4,Jeremy,False,5,This isn't the answer Andy.
332,332,4,Jeremy,False,6,Drinking paint is a bad idea.
333,333,4,Jeremy,False,14,You were right Mark. I was wrong. I can't fix him. I'm not Freud.
334,334,4,Jeremy,False,6,I'm not going to punch you.
335,335,4,Jeremy,False,5,No. You'll punch me back.
336,336,4,Jeremy,False,4,It's what he wants.
337,337,4,Jeremy,False,2,Fucking hell!
338,338,4,Jeremy,False,2,Apologise Mark.
339,339,4,Jeremy,False,17,"I admit my therapeutic approach was unorthodox, but I think I might have saved a guy's life."
340,340,4,Jeremy,True,1,OK...
341,341,4,Jeremy,True,40,"Oh, come on Mark. And the fucking rest. Tell her about Stephanie. Tell her you've got the horn for a hot MILF. Tell her you want to stick it in. You're not letting me steal your girlfriend, you total bastard."
342,342,4,Jeremy,True,14,"Come on then, Mark, time to tell Dobby about your trip to Cougar Town."
343,343,4,Jeremy,False,10,"Mark, is there anything else you need to tell Dobby?"
344,344,4,Jeremy,True,10,"No, not that, that's my line. You've stolen my line."
345,345,4,Jeremy,True,5,I properly love you Dobby.
346,346,4,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
347,347,4,Jeremy,True,10,"And for that image, I only have myself to blame."
348,348,5,Jeremy,True,33,"Don't look at Dobby. Don't even think about Dobby. If I don't look at Dobby, I can't be in love with her. Just focus on the game. Beat Mark's nephew. Lovely, calming, beating."
349,349,5,Jeremy,False,2,Where's Dobby?
350,350,5,Jeremy,True,14,"Thank God. As you were, eyes. You can look away from the TV again."
351,351,5,Jeremy,False,3,What's this for?
352,352,5,Jeremy,False,11,How can you be a travelling sales rep? You can't drive.
353,353,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Oh, I see, you're gonna go by barge. That's a good idea."
354,354,5,Jeremy,False,2,This weekend?
355,355,5,Jeremy,False,5,So this is an ultimatum?
356,356,5,Jeremy,False,14,"Oh, hi. What's up? Have you been crying? It's not my fault is it?"
357,357,5,Jeremy,True,8,"OK, I have no idea who Nick is."
358,358,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, shit. Come here."
359,359,5,Jeremy,True,8,"You feel bad, so I feel you, classic."
360,360,5,Jeremy,False,5,Do you want some Cava?
361,361,5,Jeremy,True,57,"Of course, Mark's sister. She's got nice sad eyes and is all vulnerable and huggy. Forget Dobby. Dobby's gone. Sarah's here now. I mean, I shouldn't just take the first thing that comes along unless... maybe it's fate? Good old fate. It does the hard work so you don't have to. Or am I thinking of Flash?"
362,362,5,Jeremy,False,10,Great news Mark. I've found a new place to live.
363,363,5,Jeremy,False,5,"No, that's Mark's as well."
364,364,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, no. I mean there's more."
365,365,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Well, I put all my vinyl on mini disc and the naughties and then threw away the mini discs in the teenies."
366,366,5,Jeremy,True,11,How can that be all my stuff? Why is everything Mark's?
367,367,5,Jeremy,False,4,These chairs are mine.
368,368,5,Jeremy,True,13,"Fuck you Mark. If you're gonna hump Dobby, I'm gonna hump your chairs."
369,369,5,Jeremy,True,10,T-shirt on a coat hanger. I am living the dream.
370,370,5,Jeremy,True,31,"Hey, honey, you're home. This is so great. She'll probably want sex right now. That'll be how I'm paying rent. I'm an actual rent boy. Why didn't I do this before?"
371,371,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Yes, great."
372,372,5,Jeremy,False,8,"I know of it. It's squares, isn't it?"
373,373,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Cool, will do, great."
374,374,5,Jeremy,True,34,"OK, that's fine, the sex comes later. I'm still bossing this. I get to just learn chess and practice cooking for free. Ha ha. I'm exploiting the shit out of her, the poor fool."
375,375,5,Jeremy,False,5,What's that supposed to mean?
376,376,5,Jeremy,False,24,"I'm not a leech, Mark. And if I am, I'm one of the good ones that used to cure diseases in the olden days."
377,377,5,Jeremy,False,9,"What do you expect? They're leeches, not bloody doctors."
378,378,5,Jeremy,False,12,"God, that'll be Mad Andy. He's figured out he's got abandonment issues."
379,379,5,Jeremy,False,37,"Nah. Hey, there's loads about sales and shit in life coaching, you know, Mark? The key thing is to not accept negativity. So it's like, I don't hear the word ""no"" any more, I hear ""convince me""."
380,380,5,Jeremy,False,14,"Or you just say celebrities are doing it, whatever it is, that always works."
381,381,5,Jeremy,True,13,"Since Johnny Rotten started doing Country Life, I've been buttering like a bastard."
382,382,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, cool, what are these? Are they for sale?"
383,383,5,Jeremy,False,13,I'm looking for some taps for my new bathroom and I love these.
384,384,5,Jeremy,False,26,"Oh, that's a real shame, 'cause I like them, a lot. As would all my friends and colleagues. I think Mark Ronson has ones like these."
385,385,5,Jeremy,False,5,"They're amazing, I want them."
386,386,5,Jeremy,False,16,"No, no, no it has to be these ones. These exact ones. Can I buy them?"
387,387,5,Jeremy,True,28,I am such a good friend. and person. But I still get the glare! I'd probably still get the glare if I gave him one of my kidneys.
388,388,5,Jeremy,False,1,Well?
389,389,5,Jeremy,False,1,Amazing!
390,390,5,Jeremy,False,8,Is he the guy that rides the ostrich?
391,391,5,Jeremy,False,5,Thanks would have been nice.
392,392,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Well, keep pushing."
393,393,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Mark, keep pushing."
394,394,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Quickly, Mark, let's go, we've been rumbled."
395,395,5,Jeremy,False,4,Thanks a lot mate.
396,396,5,Jeremy,False,20,"Yeah, great. Just make sure you mention the door to the bins thing. That lock is a massive ball ache."
397,397,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Bins Mark, bins."
398,398,5,Jeremy,False,7,Can I eat my dinner now please?
399,399,5,Jeremy,True,13,Am I even dancing any more? It's hard to tell without music on.
400,400,5,Jeremy,True,15,"I'm a toy boy in the sense that I am a toy, for a boy."
401,401,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, hi."
402,402,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Hey, here's to Chairman Mark. Or ""Chairman Maok"". Or ""Chairmark Mao""."
403,403,5,Jeremy,False,5,"What do you mean, famine?"
404,404,5,Jeremy,False,4,I know his name.
405,405,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, have I got a calendar?"
406,406,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Uh, can I see my calendar?"
407,407,5,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, yeah, yeah, it's great. She's great. It's all great. But there is this one thing."
408,408,5,Jeremy,False,14,"Not that. It's just that her tastes have changed a bit, in the bedroom."
409,409,5,Jeremy,False,28,"I mean I'm cool with S&M and obviously if she wants to be S, then I have to be M. I mean we can't both be the M."
410,410,5,Jeremy,False,25,"I think it's 'cause of Fifty Shades of Grey. I think reading that has made her very horny, but at the same time very angry."
411,411,5,Jeremy,False,25,"Oh, you're the S&M expert all of a sudden are you? Mr. ""I'm so scared of women touching my arsehole, I pretend it's really ticklish."""
412,412,5,Jeremy,True,15,"Nice one, Simon. That's me getting hit with a selection of objects all fucking night."
413,413,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, flatmate."
414,414,5,Jeremy,False,44,"I've had a big think. I've decided you were right about me leaching off Sarah. So, I'm back. I've ordered us a pizza and I've found an amazing YouTube clip of a monkey riding a pig. So let's just hunker down and veg out."
415,415,5,Jeremy,False,7,But I've moved all my stuff back.
416,416,5,Jeremy,False,16,"And my clothes and my porn case. Don't make me move that again, it's really heavy."
417,417,5,Jeremy,False,43,"I can't take it any more at Sarah's. OK. It's not just the S&M. It's the cooking and the cleaning and the constant dancing. I'm like some pole dancing, oven scrubbing, migrant sex worker. Let me back into the first world, Mark, please?"
418,418,5,Jeremy,False,5,I really appreciate this Andy.
419,419,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Great, I can sleep in a corner."
420,420,5,Jeremy,True,36,"Brilliant, sharing a flat with a psycho. ""Who's that in the corner Andy?"" ""Oh, that's my life coach."" ""That shivering pale man with a suitcase of porn is helping me get my life back on track."""
421,421,5,Jeremy,True,37,I'm sleeping in a bin bag. I'm human rubbish. My sixth form careers advisor was right all along. It's not even a thick green one for garden waste. This is black for landfill. I belong in landfill.
422,422,5,Jeremy,False,3,Hi. It's me.
423,423,5,Jeremy,False,17,I forgot my Megadrive. I forgot the one thing I own I can't masturbate to or in.
424,424,5,Jeremy,False,19,"And also, can I stay? I slept in a bin bag at Andy's and... I couldn't really handle it."
425,425,5,Jeremy,False,36,"Yeah, the good news is that Super Hans' bag is now available and that's a sleeping bag, not a bin bag, but it does have someone sleeping in it tonight. But tomorrow it's mine, all mine."
426,426,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, he won't have that."
427,427,5,Jeremy,True,8,And that's why I never cooked it again.
428,428,5,Jeremy,False,1,Great.
429,429,5,Jeremy,True,19,"Sorry, Mark. I'll fight Dobby, but I won't fight my feelings. I like my feelings. My naughty, naughty feelings."
430,430,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Really glad to be moving in with you, Hans."
431,431,6,Jeremy,True,5,Literally nowhere else to go.
432,432,6,Jeremy,True,12,"Oh, here goes. Oh, it's OK. No skagheads, no corpses, no nonces."
433,433,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Right. Great. She isn't still using it, is she?"
434,434,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Right, sorry, of course."
435,435,6,Jeremy,True,7,The bag. Finally my destiny has arrived.
436,436,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Right, well, this is nice. I can put all of my- Ah! Hans, it's a snake!"
437,437,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Not to be too la-di-da, but is there a room with fewer snakes available?"
438,438,6,Jeremy,False,16,"I'm not trying to move back in or anything, just forgot to give you my keys."
439,439,6,Jeremy,True,13,That's nice. He's so nice. He might even let me steal his girlfriend.
440,440,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Yeah, loose keys. Never owned a keyring, waste of money."
441,441,6,Jeremy,False,26,"Your Holsten Pils keyring? The guys over at Holsten are laughing their arses off at you, advertising their beer to yourself every time you come home."
442,442,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Hi, Dobs. Yeah, great."
443,443,6,Jeremy,True,8,"Wet from the shower, warm from the oven."
444,444,6,Jeremy,False,28,Great to get finally bagged up. It's like a chrysalis. I'm going to emerge like some kind of mad butterfly. Just came back to give Mark my keys.
445,445,6,Jeremy,True,34,"God, I love you. It's all good. Except it's all so very bad. Oh, my room. It's like looking at my own grave, except I'm so dead there's not even a body in it."
446,446,6,Jeremy,False,8,What happened to the bed and the desk?
447,447,6,Jeremy,False,6,Did you see anyone take them?
448,448,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Oh, that's nice to know. Gone to a good home, old beddy."
449,449,6,Jeremy,False,11,I could give it a lick of paint if you like.
450,450,6,Jeremy,True,7,Pay me to hang around with Dobby.
451,451,6,Jeremy,False,8,I'll do it to the highest professional standards.
452,452,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Please, Mark."
453,453,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Yeah, great."
454,454,6,Jeremy,False,17,"No, no, it's nice. I mean, little bump, cos my room is a bit... full of snakes."
455,455,6,Jeremy,False,44,"Yeah, it's a bit of a snake pit. But we're going to bag them up once we get some coke and get on a bagging vibe. Until then, I'm sleeping on the sofa, which is great. Except Hans is... something of a night owl."
456,456,6,Jeremy,False,54,"Yeah, really good. I mean, we are taking quite a lot of drugs. I did wonder, before, you know? Will it be too much drugs at Hans'? I mean, he talks a lot about them but he probably doesn't take that many. But it turns out, he does do a hell of a lot."
457,457,6,Jeremy,False,11,Yeah. We had a system but it kind of broke down.
458,458,6,Jeremy,False,27,"You need to be really careful with the ratios. We just got the ratios a bit off. So, I do think I am addicted to drugs now."
459,459,6,Jeremy,False,10,"I'm not a drug addict. Not until very, very recently."
460,460,6,Jeremy,False,27,"That's not being a drug addict, Mark, you moron. That's just having a little number to take the edge off. So, um, Dobby's finally moved in. Congratulations."
461,461,6,Jeremy,True,4,"You lucky, lucky bastard."
462,462,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, right."
463,463,6,Jeremy,True,13,"""Jason's van""? That sounds like the kind of bullshit I come up with."
464,464,6,Jeremy,True,7,"Yes! God, I'm such a bad friend."
465,465,6,Jeremy,True,2,"Duh, obviously."
466,466,6,Jeremy,False,4,"I wouldn't worry, mate."
467,467,6,Jeremy,True,1,Shit.
468,468,6,Jeremy,False,1,Great.
469,469,6,Jeremy,False,4,Brilliant. Yeah. Very romantic.
470,470,6,Jeremy,True,37,"Need to admit I love Dobby. Who to tell first? Her, more exciting. Him, more noble. Or together? More Jeremy Kyle, with a small chance he might cave my head in with his 2003 Personal Finance Award."
471,471,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, well, that's gonna happen, unless I take forever."
472,472,6,Jeremy,False,5,"It's apple white, it's cheaper."
473,473,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, come on, Mark. You knew when you hired me it wasn't gonna be a professional job."
474,474,6,Jeremy,True,20,"Ooh, poor old Mark. The old stepping-on-the-rake trick. All I have to do is paint and wait. Wait and paint."
475,475,6,Jeremy,False,12,"I actually did quite a good job, though I say it myself."
476,476,6,Jeremy,False,19,No problemo. I'd have doubted me too if- hang on. Have you cleaned the paint off that light switch?
477,477,6,Jeremy,False,13,"Yes, you bloody did! This is loads better than when I left it."
478,478,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, God, look. All the charm's gone. All my little touches. It's like you've put a fluorescent safety jacket on the Mona Lisa."
479,479,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, no."
480,480,6,Jeremy,True,2,"Oh, God."
481,481,6,Jeremy,True,1,Fuck!
482,482,6,Jeremy,False,21,"The Quantocks? Where you accidentally proposed to Sophie? Is that where you have to ask women to marry you, by law?"
483,483,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Well, honestly..."
484,484,6,Jeremy,True,34,This is the moment. Got to tell him the truth. Tell him I love Dobby. Grasp the nettle and get stung to fuck and face the firing squad and get shot to bloody pieces.
485,485,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, good plan."
486,486,6,Jeremy,False,1,Ah!
487,487,6,Jeremy,True,11,"Didn't grasp the nettle, obviously. Who would grasp a fucking nettle?"
488,488,6,Jeremy,True,50,"Got to tell him I love Dobby. That's the honourable way. Tell him, then tell Dobby. Dobby will say she needs to think about it. but I'll be able to tell she really does love me, probably. And we buy Mark a cake and all have a right old laugh?"
489,489,6,Jeremy,False,4,Hope everything goes well.
490,490,6,Jeremy,True,8,Got to say it. Got to say something.
491,491,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Yeah. So, apologies, but I think you should know I'm in love with Dobby."
492,492,6,Jeremy,False,17,"I thought it was only fair for you to know. Goodbye. Sorry, can I just get past?"
493,493,6,Jeremy,True,64,"Before my best friend kills me with a tuna baguette. Oh, my fucking God, this train is running on time. This is unprecedented. Oh, no. Oh, fuck! Oh, back to the scene of the crime to face the music and dance, like some mad musical murderer. How the hell am I gonna play this? Just going to totally fucking ignore it. It never happened."
494,494,6,Jeremy,False,16,"So, I'm back. Oh, look, an interview with the new USA national football coach, Jürgen Klinsmann."
495,495,6,Jeremy,False,13,"Look, I'm really, really sorry but Dobby... I mean, she's just so lovely."
496,496,6,Jeremy,False,13,I feel terrible. I do. I've been carrying around this weight for months.
497,497,6,Jeremy,False,25,"You don't understand, Mark. I'm in love with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. The love tap is gushing."
498,498,6,Jeremy,False,4,I can't. I've tried.
499,499,6,Jeremy,False,44,"How am I supposed to do that when there's no such thing as elbow grease? Look, Mark, I knew how much this would hurt you, how angry you'd be. That's why I planned to tell you and then get off the train right afterwards."
500,500,6,Jeremy,False,8,"God, this is so stressful. I feel terrible."
501,501,6,Jeremy,False,14,I don't suppose you'd lend me some money for a drink? Bit of lager?
502,502,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah, I wasn't meant to be here. I was just helping him with his luggage."
503,503,6,Jeremy,False,13,And then the doors closed. I- I've come on the train by mistake.
504,504,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Mark, would you mind?"
505,505,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, for God's sake, it's thirty quid, I'll pay you back."
506,506,6,Jeremy,False,22,"Look, I'm sorry about this, but this is really between you two rather than me. I mean, we're friends, we live together."
507,507,6,Jeremy,False,15,We're on a weird one. He's got the money. Ask him why he won't pay.
508,508,6,Jeremy,False,23,She can't throw me off a moving train in the middle of nowhere! What if I walk on the tracks? I might die.
509,509,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Great with me, that's where we're going."
510,510,6,Jeremy,False,12,"I need to tell Dobby. I told you, like an honourable man."
511,511,6,Jeremy,False,11,"That's as may be, but by my own code of ethics..."
512,512,6,Jeremy,False,38,"...I think I've done the right thing. So, now, I'm going to come with you and tell Dobby how I feel. I mean, you've got to admit, me and Dobby are a better fit than you. We click."
513,513,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, the clicking is continuous! That's why you haven't noticed it. Click, click, click, click, click, click."
514,514,6,Jeremy,False,47,"No, they don't. Not really. That's just something that scientists and people in horrible relationships say. I mean, be honest, the things you always moan about Dobby. I mean, you know, the DJ bars, the dope smoking, the poorly arranged finances. Don't they remind you of someone?"
515,515,6,Jeremy,False,5,Me and Dobby don't quibble.
516,516,6,Jeremy,False,25,"Look, I'm really, really serious, Mark. I can't see a way out of this. I think maybe... like... like one of us should kill ourselves."
517,517,6,Jeremy,False,19,Do you think I'm some kind of sex duckling who'll follow anyone around who's got breasts and a vagina?
518,518,6,Jeremy,False,24,"I love Dobby, Mark! And I know it's true love because I'm prepared to sacrifice my closest friendship for it. I'm gonna tell her."
519,519,6,Jeremy,False,12,"By which time, you've got her all married like a trussed-up hog."
520,520,6,Jeremy,False,2,OK. Deal?
521,521,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah. Actually, thinking about it, I don't know if I am gonna go back. Hi."
522,522,6,Jeremy,False,16,I know. I've just got this quite strong feeling you're gonna break the agreement and propose.
523,523,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Yeah, I know. The thing is, I don't trust you."
524,524,6,Jeremy,False,12,"If you say that, I might be forced to say something too."
525,525,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, Dobs."
526,526,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Don't mind me. I'll just be hanging out, staying close to my buddy here."
527,527,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Cause we look after each other. You watch my back, I watch yours. Isn't that right, dude?"
528,528,6,Jeremy,False,8,I won't be long! I'll be very quick!
529,529,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Yes, please."
530,530,6,Jeremy,True,15,He'd better not have bloody said anything or there will be repercussions. Extremely romantic repercussions.
531,531,6,Jeremy,False,5,So did I miss anything?
532,532,6,Jeremy,False,1,Brilliant.
533,533,6,Jeremy,True,38,"He doesn't want any delicious pie? Normally, he loves pie. Suspicious. Very suspicious. He did spend a long time in the kitchen preparing the picnic. Of course! A ring! He's smuggled the bloody engagement ring into the pie!"
534,534,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Sorry, Dobs, just need to check something."
535,535,6,Jeremy,False,8,"I'm wise to you, my fine feathered friend."
536,536,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Apologies. All good. Great picnic, though, Dobs."
537,537,6,Jeremy,False,4,"No, I bloody didn't."
538,538,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, so now you're calling Dobby a liar? That's charming!"
539,539,6,Jeremy,False,7,She was being sarcastic. Can't you tell?
540,540,6,Jeremy,False,3,This is horrible.
541,541,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, so you can ask her to marry you?"
542,542,6,Jeremy,False,3,Fuck the agreement.
543,543,6,Jeremy,False,52,"You know how weak my powers of self-control are. Normally I can't wait five minutes before having a wank or a spliff or a chocolate biscuit. I've restrained myself for nearly three hours. That's got to stand for something. I'm sorry, but I'm going to tell Dobby how I feel about her."
544,544,6,Jeremy,False,4,"No, you're fucking not!"
545,545,6,Jeremy,False,10,You can't ask someone to marry you without a ring.
546,546,6,Jeremy,False,7,"You can't propose, it's against the agreement."
547,547,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, fuck you!"
548,548,6,Jeremy,False,1,Dobby!
549,549,6,Jeremy,False,1,Dobby!
550,550,6,Jeremy,False,1,What?
551,551,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, really?"
552,552,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Because, Dobby, there's something I need to say to.."
553,553,6,Jeremy,True,10,What's a step up from electric? A nice big stick.
554,554,6,Jeremy,False,7,"As a matter of fact, it has."
555,555,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Come on, then. Rock me, Amadeus. You know you want to."
556,556,6,Jeremy,False,22,"Mark, if you don't throw that rock at me, I'm going to hit you with this stick. Those are the available options."
557,557,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Yeah, good one. Distract me, then crush my skull. I'm not falling for that one, old friend."
558,558,6,Jeremy,False,1,Shit.
559,559,6,Jeremy,False,1,Ow!
560,560,6,Jeremy,False,1,What?
561,561,6,Jeremy,False,26,"""Was hoping this weekend would be a chance to make up after all the weirdness."" She means you spying on her. You've fucked it, you idiot."
562,562,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Hang on, why does it say here that I'm eighty percent gay?"
563,563,6,Jeremy,False,1,Dobby!
564,564,1,Mark,False,4,"Hello boys, excuse me."
565,565,1,Mark,False,19,It's a table for my printer. You're not doing a barbecue again are you? You know that doesn't work.
566,566,1,Mark,False,4,Clearly you haven't gone.
567,567,1,Mark,False,15,"Well, you stopped paying rent. Or rather, you've stopped being guilty about not paying rent."
568,568,1,Mark,False,3,"OK, a job."
569,569,1,Mark,False,7,"Thank, thanks for the job tip, Hans."
570,570,1,Mark,True,21,"Christ, headhunted by Super Hans. He might be one of the few Western head-hunters who would physically chop a head off."
571,571,1,Mark,True,54,"So great that Dobby's agreed to move in. Just got to close the deal. Get her into the flat, and get her locked down like Fritzl. No, not like Fritzl. Like a nice, normal, loving guy who knows where she is at all times. Which at no point would be locked in the cellar."
572,572,1,Mark,False,6,Good time at Gerrard's last night?
573,573,1,Mark,False,3,"Ah, Connect Four."
574,574,1,Mark,True,24,"God, he's so sickly. She never plays Connect Four with me. I'd love to play Connect Four with her, if it wasn't so boring."
575,575,1,Mark,False,2,"Aw, really?"
576,576,1,Mark,True,10,I bet some parts of him can move very well.
577,577,1,Mark,False,18,"Looks like I've got a job interview lined up, bathroom supplies. Incredibly flat management structure, which is cool."
578,578,1,Mark,True,4,"Ah, lovely, fake enthusiasm."
579,579,1,Mark,True,7,"Hold on, what's that, what's that there?"
580,580,1,Mark,False,5,"Oh, a new tin-opener? Sweet."
581,581,1,Mark,True,52,"I've got a tin-opener, why is she buying a new tin-opener? Fuck, she's not gonna move in. This is no pound shop-tin opener. This is a luxury tin-opener! She's gonna use this to open her single tins, and then somehow get the sexual satisfaction from it I so obviously can't give her."
582,582,1,Mark,False,20,"Oh, uh, Dobs, just because I need to do a form, when do you think you might be moving in?"
583,583,1,Mark,False,2,"Ah, cool."
584,584,1,Mark,True,14,"The getting together of the shit. Could take a night, could take five years."
585,585,1,Mark,True,80,"Need more information. The tin opener isn't conclusive. Could ask her straight how she feels. Ha ha ha. Yeah, right. What if I broke the microwave? Test case, if she buys a new one, then I'll know she's never moving in. Hmm, can I? Yeah. Maybe a good old waggle in there. Take that, mechanism! You weren't built for the screwdriver, were you? You don't like that in there, do you? Ha ha. No macaroni for us tonight. Sorry, microwave."
586,586,1,Mark,False,18,"Oh, Dobs, it looks like your bloody microwave's bust or something. Still, I've got one at mine, so..."
587,587,1,Mark,False,1,Gerrard's?
588,588,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, sure."
589,589,1,Mark,True,25,"The sickly Casanova. Aiming for a bit more ""Connect Foreplay"". Well, I'm gonna block your bright red cock with my multiple discs of yellow cock."
590,590,1,Mark,True,23,"Yes, Gerrard, but there's a sting in the tail. A scorpion in the Kinder egg, a nail in the Toblerone, and, 'tis I!"
591,591,1,Mark,False,21,"Yes, we were about to have a romantic Italian dinner for two when you rang, so I thought I'd come along."
592,592,1,Mark,False,24,"Oh, that's not the spirit, mind over matter! Your friend the Cyberman wouldn't be so defeatist. Nor would any of your other brilliant... dolls."
593,593,1,Mark,False,6,"I know what you're doing, Gerrard."
594,594,1,Mark,False,7,I've got my beady eye on you.
595,595,1,Mark,False,17,"She's not interested in romancing the stone, Gerrard. It's no dice for you and your sickly ways."
596,596,1,Mark,True,18,I can't compete with that! A free room at Gerrard's versus fifty quid a week for Fritzl's cellar.
597,597,1,Mark,True,28,"Time to say goodbye to daddy, and hand you over to mummy. Hmm, pretty sure he's parked a turd in there. Sophie can change that in the lift."
598,598,1,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Soph."
599,599,1,Mark,True,2,"Oh, great."
600,600,1,Mark,False,1,Jeff?
601,601,1,Mark,False,2,Oh. R-Right.
602,602,1,Mark,True,15,"God, should I? Give the thing I love best to the man I hate most?"
603,603,1,Mark,False,4,"Don't think so, mate."
604,604,1,Mark,True,42,"Maybe Ian won't remember I gave him away to another man. If he does, he'll be some kind of memory genius. ""Yeah, my son hates me, but he can remember a full deck of cards, and that's why he lives in Vegas."""
605,605,1,Mark,False,20,I think it's OK. Or do you think there's any chance he's trying to kill all my offspring? Like Herod?
606,606,1,Mark,False,6,"That's a lot of shopping, Jez."
607,607,1,Mark,False,16,"Right. It's just, Dobby might well have moved in before we eat all these horrible lentils."
608,608,1,Mark,False,17,"She is moving in, you know? I'm getting a firm date. Why have you got cat food?"
609,609,1,Mark,False,34,"Great, so now they'll think we're a couple of guys with our booze, and our pizzas, and a cat we starve, and an old man we've kidnapped whose dentures we periodically deign to cleanse."
610,610,1,Mark,False,4,"Margherita or pepperoni, Dobs?"
611,611,1,Mark,False,6,He doesn't know what that means.
612,612,1,Mark,True,6,He doesn't know what that means.
613,613,1,Mark,False,28,"Jeremy's planning to sell the headline, ""Three-oh Walcott"" to a tabloid newspaper when Theo Walcott turns thirty, and we've agreed not to argue whether that's a good plan."
614,614,1,Mark,False,2,I know.
615,615,1,Mark,False,15,"You know what, Jez? If you like, I could pay for you to have therapy."
616,616,1,Mark,False,12,Why don't I give you that? Your deposit? Since you're moving on.
617,617,1,Mark,False,7,It's a goodbye gift. Fuck the stain.
618,618,1,Mark,False,13,Spend it on a nut doctor to work out what's wrong with you.
619,619,1,Mark,False,5,"I like you, too, Jez."
620,620,1,Mark,False,20,"Oh, Dobs, you saw him last night, and the night before. It's like you're turning into his personal bum boy."
621,621,1,Mark,False,13,"It's just, I was really looking forward to spending the evening with you."
622,622,1,Mark,False,20,It looks like there's someone on The Apprentice who I think we're both going to really loathe. A real specimen.
623,623,1,Mark,False,9,"Look Dobs, sometimes you need to draw a line."
624,624,1,Mark,False,6,You know you wanted me to.
625,625,1,Mark,True,9,Interview advice from the disordered mind of the crackhead.
626,626,1,Mark,False,1,Right.
627,627,1,Mark,False,7,A shit and a glass of water?
628,628,1,Mark,True,30,"OK, here goes. At least I'm the first one in. ""Hi, Robert Grayson, I'm Mark Corrigan"". ""Hi, Robert Grayson, pleased to meet you."" ""Hi, Mr. Grayson, pleased to meet you."""
629,629,1,Mark,False,2,Thank you.
630,630,1,Mark,True,7,"""Hi, Mr. Grayson, pleased to meet you!"""
631,631,1,Mark,False,8,"Hi, I'm Robert Grayson, pleased to meet you."
632,632,1,Mark,False,2,"No, s-sure."
633,633,1,Mark,False,12,"No. I-I-I'm sorry, you are. You are, I'm not. I'm very sorry."
634,634,1,Mark,True,15,"Hmm, I have a sudden, overpowering desire for a glass of water, and a baguette."
635,635,1,Mark,True,68,"Wow, I can't believe I got a second interview! If I can only remember my own name at the next one, I might be in with a chance. Hang on, this is prime therapy time. Oh, I get it, the lady doth eat bhaji too much, methinks. I've seen behind the curtain. Ahoy there, moral high ground. He's wasting fice hundred of my pounds, and it feels fantastic."
636,636,1,Mark,False,6,"Hi, Jez, how was your session?"
637,637,1,Mark,False,6,Cured? Did they use that phrase?
638,638,1,Mark,False,30,"Well they certainly cost a pretty penny, so I imagine they must know what they're talking about. I guess you won't have had the chance to get anything to eat?"
639,639,1,Mark,False,15,"I thought so, so, I've got us both a lovely big curry as a treat."
640,640,1,Mark,False,8,"Come on, sit down, tuck in, there's bhajis."
641,641,1,Mark,False,23,"Chicken tikka masala, balti tiger prawn, vegetable korma. I thought I'd really push the boat out. There's a naan and a half each."
642,642,1,Mark,False,11,"So, are they any particular school, your therapist, Jez? I'm interested."
643,643,1,Mark,False,16,"A mixture? That is interesting. Have some of the lamb pasanda. It's incredibly rich, and creamy."
644,644,1,Mark,False,10,I've bought you a lovely curry. What's wrong with that?
645,645,1,Mark,False,18,"No. Just tell me. Just say it, and it'll all be fine. No more curry, no more problem."
646,646,1,Mark,False,3,Then eat up.
647,647,1,Mark,False,5,"Yes, I am happy now."
648,648,1,Mark,False,16,"Hey, great news, I got called back for a second interview at Baths, Bathrooms & Fittings!"
649,649,1,Mark,False,3,Ha ha. What?
650,650,1,Mark,False,1,When?
651,651,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, Jesus."
652,652,1,Mark,True,25,"Fucking hell, Gerrard, there was no need to die. God, I only disliked you a bit. I didn't want you to... fuck. Oh, bloody hell."
653,653,1,Mark,False,7,Blimey. What- what did he die of?
654,654,1,Mark,False,4,He died of flu?
655,655,1,Mark,False,6,"Hey Jeremy, Gerrard's died of flu."
656,656,1,Mark,False,1,Seriously.
657,657,1,Mark,False,2,I know.
658,658,1,Mark,True,13,"Oh my goodness, dead. He's actually dead. He's gone. He's never coming back."
659,659,1,Mark,False,3,"Oh, God, uh."
660,660,1,Mark,False,12,"In a way, though, d-don't you think that's what he would've wanted?"
661,661,1,Mark,False,12,Sure. Me- me too. I wish he was... OK. I really do.
662,662,1,Mark,True,11,"The reproachful, but still quite irritating voice from beyond the grave."
663,663,1,Mark,False,27,"Do you know what, Dobs? We're gonna make this the best darn funeral ever. Nice chapel, eulogies. The wake, somewhere lovely. I can get a wake cake."
664,664,1,Mark,True,33,"Jesus. Life. Spinning past. Every second, every single fleeting moment till we're gone. I'm taking a look at my phone tariff. I've got a very strong feeling I'm being fucked in the arse."
665,665,1,Mark,True,35,"Third place we've been to. Feels like she's still seeing more of him than me. Funeral parlour, massage parlour. Those are the main parlours, aren't they? What's their link? Both lying down? Except, pizza parlour?"
666,666,1,Mark,False,6,"Hey guys, this one feel right?"
667,667,1,Mark,False,17,"Oh great, that is nice. It looks, if this doesn't sound weird, like his sort of place."
668,668,1,Mark,True,5,"Hmm, definitely does sound weird."
669,669,1,Mark,False,6,Do you know what I mean?
670,670,1,Mark,False,2,Yeah. Gerrard.
671,671,1,Mark,True,11,The guy's really come into his own since he's been dead.
672,672,1,Mark,False,12,B-but is... is that the best time? Is that a good time?
673,673,1,Mark,False,27,"It's just, it's stupid really but, I have actually got called back for a second interview, and I wondered, because that's set, whether maybe we should consider-"
674,674,1,Mark,False,13,"Forget I said anything. Forget the interview. But never, repeat, never forget Gerrard."
675,675,1,Mark,True,12,"Interview then funeral, the ultimate combo. Minicab waiting, same outfit for both."
676,676,1,Mark,False,5,Great. Survival of the slickest.
677,677,1,Mark,True,11,Just leave that to hang like the bad fart it is.
678,678,1,Mark,False,34,"If I may, perhaps we should pool our skill sets by subdividing into working groups. How about you guys look at the logo, and web strategy, while Hugh has a think about the rebrand?"
679,679,1,Mark,True,10,Fucking my rival with the dildo of the impossible rebrand.
680,680,1,Mark,False,15,"And, if you like, I can link us all together, and do the boring stuff."
681,681,1,Mark,True,9,"He said self-effacingly, as he definitely secured the job."
682,682,1,Mark,False,10,"Hey, hey hey, this place is great! What a find!"
683,683,1,Mark,False,10,"Sorry, it's just, it went pretty well at the interview."
684,684,1,Mark,False,10,"No, sure, obviously. Still, this looks like a great funeral."
685,685,1,Mark,True,5,"God, I feel so upbeat!"
686,686,1,Mark,True,36,This is a mega funeral. It was a mega interview. Hugh was the only real rival. But look what's happened to Gerrard. This is what I do to rivals. I put my rivals in the ground.
687,687,1,Mark,True,22,"A third interview, in half an hour? Say no? Hugh won't say no. Could I? Out in five, cab over in twenty?"
688,688,1,Mark,True,25,"Yeah. Listerine in the cab, swill the backwash into my Volvic, spurt of Lynx, it's the busy man's shower! OK, the edit, the brutal edit."
689,689,1,Mark,False,12,"Um, OK, hi. So there's, there's so much to say about Gerrard."
690,690,1,Mark,True,6,"That can all go, that goes."
691,691,1,Mark,False,11,"In a way, whatever I say will end up feeling incomplete."
692,692,1,Mark,True,3,Covered myself there.
693,693,1,Mark,False,25,"So why don't I just sum up? My first day I thought, what a great guy. I liked him as soon as I met him."
694,694,1,Mark,True,5,This is gonna take forever.
695,695,1,Mark,False,37,"Yes, I mean, why don't I just give you the stories, the highlights? Aberdeen, the Finnemore numbers, tube up the nose! But so noble. World of Warcraft, huge for him. JLB, obviously, which I think Alan hit."
696,696,1,Mark,True,6,"Sum up, time to sum up."
697,697,1,Mark,False,30,"Look, I don't want to warble on when we probably all want to be out grieving and crying in a more well-catered environment. Sarnies! God, he loved a sandwich, seriously."
698,698,1,Mark,True,2,That's enough.
699,699,1,Mark,False,20,"So, I just feel very sad, that's the take home message which I want you all to go away with."
700,700,1,Mark,True,16,"Think I got away with that. Yeah, if you've got any complaints, tell 'em to Gerrard."
701,701,1,Mark,False,9,"Me? Oh, nightmare! Getting hold of the wake cake."
702,702,1,Mark,False,9,Gotta have a wake cake. Ta da! Specially made.
703,703,1,Mark,False,9,"No, Gerrard loved the... the reds, the red team."
704,704,1,Mark,True,12,"Oh, come on, there were three shelves of cakes cheaper than this!"
705,705,1,Mark,False,5,"Great, I got the job!"
706,706,1,Mark,False,3,Are you OK?
707,707,1,Mark,False,2,"OK, good."
708,708,1,Mark,False,6,"OK, good, w-what did he say?"
709,709,1,Mark,False,10,Yeah. Is it just saying therapy that you're into now?
710,710,1,Mark,False,3,"I know, yes."
711,711,1,Mark,True,4,Sell it on eBay?
712,712,1,Mark,True,2,Of course.
713,713,1,Mark,False,3,On my way.
714,714,1,Mark,True,28,"The microwave test, the moment of truth. Will she stay, or will she go? If she stays, there will be trouble. If she goes, I'll get a cuddle."
715,715,1,Mark,False,19,"So, what are you thinking on the microwave then, Dobs? You gonna just wait and use mine when you-"
716,716,1,Mark,False,3,You've fixed it?
717,717,1,Mark,False,10,"Great, you've tricked the microwave into releasing its dangerous rays."
718,718,1,Mark,False,26,"Dobby, are you gonna move in with me soon, do you reckon? 'Cause all this horrible death is making me really keen to start my life."
719,719,1,Mark,False,4,"Yeah, but not really."
720,720,1,Mark,False,20,"Yeah, but he won't move out until you move in. And it's so expensive for you here on your own."
721,721,1,Mark,True,27,"She's never going to move in. Well played, Gerrard. You couldn't beat me on earth, so you're shitting on me from heaven. Like a dead, jealous pigeon."
722,722,2,Mark,False,53,"Glass shower door. Attractive, but soon the streaks will appear. The thing about bathroom accessories is I can sell you your dream bathroom, I'd be delighted to. But it don't mean a ting if it ain't got that swing. The old WP. Water pressure. And I'm sorry, but that just ain't my department."
723,723,2,Mark,False,6,At least I have a job.
724,724,2,Mark,False,18,You know you're too old to be a rent boy? There's not a big market for rent men.
725,725,2,Mark,False,28,"Yes, but what kind of mad therapy? Jezzercise, where you hump people better with crystals? Guess it's better than some of your job ideas, like becoming an Admiral."
726,726,2,Mark,False,8,Is that particular quote from Jung or Freud?
727,727,2,Mark,False,2,Hard work?
728,728,2,Mark,False,1,Golf?
729,729,2,Mark,False,29,"Oh, well, I'm sorry, if they've got a website, then the people running it definitely have fingers. And a computer. Or at least the address of an internet café."
730,730,2,Mark,False,3,After a week?
731,731,2,Mark,True,11,Although it may in fact be a failed musician with chlamydia.
732,732,2,Mark,True,38,"Oh, God, I am now in the morning, and I should have been in bed in the night. And I have to get up for work in the morning! Not next morning, this morning! Uh, Simon, the ex."
733,733,2,Mark,True,18,So great that we get to hang out with our girlfriend's exes in the modern world. So relaxing.
734,734,2,Mark,False,11,Very good luck to you in this incredibly hostile business environment.
735,735,2,Mark,False,18,"Me? Oh, retail. Reckon the High Street's gonna make a comeback. So, uh, yeah. Very exciting. Bathroom supplies."
736,736,2,Mark,True,12,"I've dropped the ""B"" word, and they don't know what to say."
737,737,2,Mark,False,11,"Yes, that's my niche, shitting and washing. Those babies are recession-proof."
738,738,2,Mark,True,4,"I love you, Dobby!"
739,739,2,Mark,False,4,"Oh, it's... it's nothing."
740,740,2,Mark,False,16,"Well, I mean, it is... it is something, I just don't want to talk about it."
741,741,2,Mark,False,17,"Business Secrets of the Pharaohs, it's called. I've got it in with several publishers, the initial chapters."
742,742,2,Mark,False,44,"Well, look, the first thing is to acknowledge that the ancient Egyptian era is so completely different from our own, then any cultural, political, or business parallels that we draw between the two eras are by their very nature almost bound to be wrong."
743,743,2,Mark,False,3,"Oh, wow. Great."
744,744,2,Mark,True,13,"Oh, God, Dobby bound more tightly with the clique, more endless evenings out."
745,745,2,Mark,False,21,"With any luck, it'll be one of the five percent of internet startups that don't fold within the first eighteen months!"
746,746,2,Mark,True,7,"God, I love those made up stats."
747,747,2,Mark,True,13,"Gerrard. Back from the grave to foil my plans, like a boring Dracula."
748,748,2,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Jez."
749,749,2,Mark,False,32,"Got the e-mail today. From BL Books. Very enthusiastic. They've got a slot, as long as I can finish my rewrites ASAP. I guess what this shows is hard work pays dividends!"
750,750,2,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, exactly."
751,751,2,Mark,True,15,"Appearing on ""I'm a Celebrity"" is not the same as winning an Olympic gold medal."
752,752,2,Mark,False,1,Eh!
753,753,2,Mark,False,1,Eh!
754,754,2,Mark,True,10,Sir Steven Redgrave and Timmy Mallett might be more appropriate.
755,755,2,Mark,False,5,"But, Dobs, Game of Thrones?"
756,756,2,Mark,False,13,"Jez, will you please get your filthy hands out of my girlfriend's brain?"
757,757,2,Mark,False,18,"You'd better not be about to tell her to ""expect more out of life,"" or ""follow her heart."""
758,758,2,Mark,False,14,I want to be her life coach. We can't both be her life coach.
759,759,2,Mark,False,16,I could if I spent two hundred quid and went to Forest Hill for five hours.
760,760,2,Mark,False,17,"Please, Jez, can you coach her that Simon's a shit, and to stop hanging out with him?"
761,761,2,Mark,False,2,What? No.
762,762,2,Mark,True,12,"Oh, he's rumbled the velvet spoon routine. That's been good for years."
763,763,2,Mark,False,16,"Look, it's just that I'm on a roll! I've done six thousand words since six PM!"
764,764,2,Mark,False,13,"I've had seven black coffees, and I feel like I'm really nailing it."
765,765,2,Mark,False,27,"Caps still count! I've just drawn an irresistible comparison between Mentuhotep the fifth and Branson. I'm thinking of drawing Branson as a hieroglyph, what do you think?"
766,766,2,Mark,False,16,"I just need to hit a thousand more words, then a spell check, then I'm done!"
767,767,2,Mark,False,3,You don't think?
768,768,2,Mark,False,14,"No problem, you're a busy guy with a lot of irons in the fire."
769,769,2,Mark,True,15,This must be the greatest quantity of squeezable mustard ever present at a literary lunch.
770,770,2,Mark,False,16,"Oh, wow! Thank you! 'Cause I hurried finishing it, I was worried I overdid chapter three."
771,771,2,Mark,False,22,"It's not too obvious? The parallel between the Nubians and the Assyrians and a modern businesses enemies, web competitors and Chinese imports?"
772,772,2,Mark,False,15,"God, that is so great to hear. 'Cause it's initially compelling, but I was worried-"
773,773,2,Mark,False,10,"Hamlet's back and he's made his final decision, to be?"
774,774,2,Mark,True,15,"God, I'm such an oaf! In publishing, he must have heard a million Hamlet jokes."
775,775,2,Mark,False,12,Oh. Of course. The Euro. The bloody Euro. Getting it wrong again.
776,776,2,Mark,False,2,Oh... right.
777,777,2,Mark,False,4,"Oh, there's no downside?"
778,778,2,Mark,False,4,"Wow, that's... that's great!"
779,779,2,Mark,True,15,Don't act too pleased. Remember Johnson. Keep your panties dry till the big guy's hard.
780,780,2,Mark,False,16,"Tell you what, Greg, why don't we go fifty-fifty on net profits over a million units?"
781,781,2,Mark,False,5,Nice doing business with you.
782,782,2,Mark,True,6,Ha ha. I'm killing these guys!
783,783,2,Mark,False,24,"Greg really liked the draft. He had no notes at all, which is pretty sweet. He was even fine about me missing the deadline."
784,784,2,Mark,False,19,"Publishing isn't an up front situation, these days. You've got to put in seed money, for the first run."
785,785,2,Mark,False,22,"It's a totally standard deal, for first time authors. But, the poor guys, I'm absolutely killing them on the big unit deals."
786,786,2,Mark,False,17,"That's different. Harry Potter books are about wizards, for children. My book is about pharaohs, for adults."
787,787,2,Mark,False,30,"In fact, it was the unluckiest day of J.K. Rowling's life when she got picked up by a publishing house. Greg, from British London, was saying ""imagine if she'd self-published!"""
788,788,2,Mark,False,5,Too patriotic for your liking?
789,789,2,Mark,False,21,"So what if it's made up? Do you think Penguin was founded by a penguin? In a sense, everything's made up."
790,790,2,Mark,False,15,"Right, well, thanks for that, Hans, but I really wouldn't worry. It's a gentleman's agreement."
791,791,2,Mark,True,17,Jeremy is the voice of reason and Super Hans is giving me legal advice. Doesn't feel great.
792,792,2,Mark,True,18,No doubt their office is a converted warehouse full of smoothie makers and basketball hoops and rim jobs.
793,793,2,Mark,False,4,Oh... wow... that's... amazing.
794,794,2,Mark,False,9,"Jeremy, you failed. She's done exactly what she wanted."
795,795,2,Mark,False,14,This won't work. You should have told her the truth. Dreams crumble to dust.
796,796,2,Mark,False,30,"Oh, what if I love a black mamba? Should I set that free? Is that what you and Sting want? A venomous killer loose on the streets of South London?"
797,797,2,Mark,False,35,"So, thinking about the book launch. Cash bar, but I might provide nuts. Salted, or dry roasted though? Salted, a classic, everyone loves salt, but expensive in the quantities I want to provide. It's tricky."
798,798,2,Mark,False,23,"British London. No, not in the current climate. OK, time to hit go. Make the transfer. Let BL fire up the printing press."
799,799,2,Mark,False,30,"The situation in Denmark is deteriorating! That's a fact! Ink shortage! But if I move quickly, BL might be able to get me some. They have a guy in Hamburg!"
800,800,2,Mark,False,1,Hey!
801,801,2,Mark,False,13,"Return my mouse, Jeremy! That's my property! You're censoring me! I'm calling amnesty!"
802,802,2,Mark,False,25,"All you're doing is preventing an important work of world literature from going to press! Why don't you intervene on Ian McEwan, or Tony Parsons?"
803,803,2,Mark,False,28,"You're just jealous because I'm a successful author, and you're an unemployed dope smoker who even after twenty years of doing it, still can't roll very good joints!"
804,804,2,Mark,False,6,Are you trying to life-coach me?
805,805,2,Mark,False,20,"I'm the one who should be doing an intervention. On you! Because, my friend, you are a vanity life coach!"
806,806,2,Mark,False,32,"Yeah, well, even if you complete your ludicrously short course, you're never going to be a life coach. It's just another dream, like being a pop star, or a front bottom inspector!"
807,807,2,Mark,False,18,"Yeah, well, a front bottom inspector is still a more realistic career option for you, than life coach!"
808,808,2,Mark,False,13,"Hey, Jeremy, do you wanna life coach this into the washing up bowl?"
809,809,2,Mark,True,15,You're not stopping my book launch. Kneel before Pharaoh Corrigan and his pyramid of peanuts.
810,810,2,Mark,False,13,"Oh. Uh... G-good. Yeah, great. Few errata. Always gonna be a few errata."
811,811,2,Mark,False,51,"No, uh, it's gonna be a good night, I reckon. Yeah? So, Jez, listen, I'm just gonna go home out the fire escape or the window, but would you ask the pub man if I can have my deposit back, and would you tell everyone I've made a horrible mistake? Goodbye."
812,812,2,Mark,False,5,"They misspelt my name, Jeremy."
813,813,2,Mark,False,11,"They're print outs, Jeremy, they're not books! They're just print outs."
814,814,2,Mark,False,18,"Greg said he really liked chapter fourteen, the Nile irrigation/viral marketing comparison. Why would he leave that out?"
815,815,2,Mark,False,22,One of those things where a cherished dream is smashed into your face and you're humiliated in front of everyone you know?
816,816,2,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Pam."
817,817,2,Mark,False,11,"Oh, no, I... I don't think people would really want to-"
818,818,2,Mark,False,3,I really don't-
819,819,2,Mark,False,124,"Ahem. Hi. Ahem. Hi, everyone. Thanks... thanks for coming. Um, I- I just wanted to say, vanity, all is vanity. Like Pharaoh Khufu, I have built a great tomb. But, tonight, I'm not gonna bury you in it with me. Except with the admittedly generous mounds of peanuts that you'll see I've provided. No, tonight I just want to say that this book is a disaster! It's a travesty! It's proof of a broken promise. But, I want to announce here that I will be aggressively pursuing British London in the small claims court. Therefore proving the wisdom of my seventh chapter, ""Make UK company law into your Anubis."" Or, as the BL spell check has rendered it, ""Make UK Company Law Your Omnibus."""
820,820,2,Mark,False,5,"It was OK, wasn't it?"
821,821,2,Mark,False,13,"And, Jeremy, I wanted to apologise for saying your life coaching was bullshit."
822,822,2,Mark,True,17,"Not even gonna correct him. That's how big I've become. I'm enormous, like the sun god Ra."
823,823,2,Mark,False,7,"I wanted to give you something, mate."
824,824,2,Mark,False,1,Greg?
825,825,2,Mark,False,14,"You may have failed the course, but you can be a life coach anyway."
826,826,2,Mark,False,7,I just thought you deserved some stars.
827,827,2,Mark,False,14,"I thought about doing five, but I didn't want to push it, you know?"
828,828,2,Mark,False,16,"But I did put ""grade excellent,"" 'cause, uh, I think you'll make an excellent life coach."
829,829,2,Mark,False,22,"And the great thing is, that the genuine document is so worthless, that there's very little chance of the forgery being detected!"
830,830,2,Mark,False,5,"See you in court, Greg."
831,831,2,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, pull the other one, it's got bells on."
832,832,2,Mark,False,19,"Not that it's any of your beeswax, but I was thinking about doing something on Napoleon and the internet."
833,833,2,Mark,False,10,"What do you think, Jez? He couldn't do it twice!"
834,834,3,Mark,False,18,"So, I thought Trish could sit here, Neil can sit here, and Simon (the ex-boyfriend) can sit there."
835,835,3,Mark,False,26,"Sorry, yes, I guess I am a bit nervous 'cause this is the first time we've hosted a social evening together in our soon-to-be joint home."
836,836,3,Mark,True,4,Sex with the ex.
837,837,3,Mark,False,4,Yeah? You and him?
838,838,3,Mark,True,3,"Oh, thank God."
839,839,3,Mark,False,1,Right.
840,840,3,Mark,False,17,"Yes, Jez, I guess that would be an exciting opportunity if it was the last website ever."
841,841,3,Mark,True,28,"Finally, the use of Jeremy and Hans becomes clear. They're my normality cloaks, allowing me to slip into human society and wreak my evil doings/make friends and relax."
842,842,3,Mark,False,14,"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Me... and my guys, and our cannabis. No thanks, I'm full."
843,843,3,Mark,False,9,I never stone alone. I'm just high on pie.
844,844,3,Mark,True,7,Bad to worse. I'm speaking in verse.
845,845,3,Mark,False,17,"Saying a rhyme ain't a crime. If I can say it to you, it must be true."
846,846,3,Mark,True,5,Am I sort of... rapping?
847,847,3,Mark,True,9,"Yes, and I printed his qualification, as a treat."
848,848,3,Mark,False,1,Great.
849,849,3,Mark,True,37,"Ugh, paintballing weekend. It's so obvious he fancies Dobby. He's just using it as cover. But he won't be expecting how incredibly taciturn and deflating I can be in social situations. The fun stops here, my friend."
850,850,3,Mark,False,7,Because you told him to leave her.
851,851,3,Mark,True,6,Paintballing and the hat game? Terrific.
852,852,3,Mark,True,13,"Obviously, and no doubt, the prize/forfeit for the losing/winning team is languorous copulation."
853,853,3,Mark,True,29,"Elbow, Elbow, Elbow, Elbow. Should I get an Elbow CD? Probably. And The Killing, and Mad Men, and an iPad, and everything. God, why won't everyone leave me alone?"
854,854,3,Mark,True,2,"Oh, Christ."
855,855,3,Mark,True,25,"And so the descent into hell begins. Just hope they're all Snow Patrol. If it's not Snow Patrol or the Beatles, I am so fucked."
856,856,3,Mark,False,2,Snow Patrol.
857,857,3,Mark,False,2,The Beatles.
858,858,3,Mark,False,5,"Oasis. I've got one, Oasis."
859,859,3,Mark,False,13,"What? Big with them? Big with Oasis? Right, who are Oasis's favourite bands?"
860,860,3,Mark,True,4,This is completely impossible.
861,861,3,Mark,False,14,"Have I said Snow Patrol? I have, haven't I? Not the Rolling Stones, obviously."
862,862,3,Mark,False,8,"Ah, Kasabian, of course, Kasabian. Kasabian, Kasabian, Kasabian."
863,863,3,Mark,False,6,"It's not Snow Patrol, is it?"
864,864,3,Mark,False,1,Madonna.
865,865,3,Mark,False,17,"OK, so, not the Beatles, 'cause famously, they were a four-piece. Bit of trivia. Susan Doyle, Boyle."
866,866,3,Mark,False,10,"Sorry, my mind's just drowning in bands, all the bands."
867,867,3,Mark,False,3,"Meatloaf, Kate Bush."
868,868,3,Mark,False,2,Hot Chocolate.
869,869,3,Mark,False,5,Of course they're a band.
870,870,3,Mark,False,12,"Hot potato, boiling potato, hot pie, hot pies, hot potato, hot potato."
871,871,3,Mark,False,1,T'Pau.
872,872,3,Mark,False,16,"I don't know, OK? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, so fuck off."
873,873,3,Mark,False,10,"Ah, yeah, OK. I thought it might be Hot Chips."
874,874,3,Mark,True,44,"Round one to you, Simon. Next time we do a quiz, it'll be on Napoleon, and while you might scrape through a few Waterloo questions, when I pin you down on the emperor's domestic reforms, I will fuck you very hard in the mouth."
875,875,3,Mark,False,15,"When I woke up, Dobby was already having a coffee and a joint with Simon."
876,876,3,Mark,False,5,"Stop life coaching him, Jeremy."
877,877,3,Mark,True,10,"At last, military strategy. You're on my turf, music geeks."
878,878,3,Mark,False,6,Grenades? Can we have some grenades?
879,879,3,Mark,False,9,We want one of those. I'm happy to pay.
880,880,3,Mark,False,5,"I don't know, the... men."
881,881,3,Mark,True,6,No men? Not even a man?
882,882,3,Mark,False,7,"Dobs, this isn't fair. Look at us."
883,883,3,Mark,True,12,Holding hands? That's not military. I'm pretty sure Rommel never held hands.
884,884,3,Mark,False,8,"I don't know how to answer that, Jeremy."
885,885,3,Mark,True,20,"Ah, this is a paintballing nightmare. Must escape, must not die. Enjoy the relaxing game. Keep girlfriend from ex sex."
886,886,3,Mark,True,19,"Ah, yes, a ditch. I should burrow further and further into the earth like the worm that I am."
887,887,3,Mark,False,1,Hans?
888,888,3,Mark,False,1,Brilliant.
889,889,3,Mark,False,16,"Wonder if Simon found a bunker. I wonder if he's in there with Dobby. Oh, God."
890,890,3,Mark,True,6,"Hmm, the lifeboat is getting overcrowded."
891,891,3,Mark,False,1,Hi.
892,892,3,Mark,True,25,"Yes, it's more the merrier in the lifeboat. You can't have too many people in a lifeboat. That's what they never, ever, ever fucking say."
893,893,3,Mark,True,48,"God, this is so frightening and boring, just like a real war. Cowering in a foxhole for months. I could've got this sensation of anxiety and fear at home by drinking three cafetieres of coffee and then lying under my bed and calling my dad after ten PM."
894,894,3,Mark,False,12,"Guys, look, they're onto you. There are too many of us here."
895,895,3,Mark,True,5,"Oh, one short, one long."
896,896,3,Mark,True,5,"Mm, a bit horrible, but-"
897,897,3,Mark,False,3,"That's right, sorry."
898,898,3,Mark,False,7,I think that you might be OK.
899,899,3,Mark,True,4,You won't be OK.
900,900,3,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
901,901,3,Mark,True,21,"Fuck, it worked. Maybe I should use the matches to get Jeremy to move out. Long, he leaves, short, he leaves."
902,902,3,Mark,False,2,Thank God.
903,903,3,Mark,False,2,The snitch?
904,904,3,Mark,False,9,A ball bearing? But that would- that'd kill you!
905,905,3,Mark,False,4,It'd go in you?
906,906,3,Mark,False,2,"Oh, God."
907,907,3,Mark,False,39,"But I'm covered in sensitive areas. I can't see a single part of me that I would nominate to be smashed with a high-velocity ball bearing. Hans, I'm really sorry, but I think I need to do a poo."
908,908,3,Mark,False,4,You had a wee.
909,909,3,Mark,True,19,"Could keep it in. But then, what if I get into a combat situation and my valves go floppy?"
910,910,3,Mark,False,4,"Oh, for God's sake."
911,911,3,Mark,True,96,"The charge of the shit brigade. Uh, force ten poo from Navarone. I thought humanity had evolved beyond this. This is a really fun weekend. Could it be any worse? Maybe. If Dobby and Simon came round the corner humping and then shot me with my pants down. Started this war as Napoleon, but I'm reduced to wiping my bum with his biography. Although I am able to pick a section I've already read. Plus, it's not like Napoleon is wiping his bum with pages of my biography, so I am, to an extent, maybe, winning."
912,912,3,Mark,True,13,Drugs. He'll probably start hallucinating I'm a yellow. Or a sexy female hostage.
913,913,3,Mark,False,6,Maybe not too much more speed?
914,914,3,Mark,False,1,Right?
915,915,3,Mark,False,11,You don't mean a real knife. You mean a paint knife.
916,916,3,Mark,False,7,"I say, let's definitely not do that."
917,917,3,Mark,False,52,"I'd say you've moved from attempted murder to violent sexual assault. Which is probably, technically moving in the, quote, right direction. How about we just surrender? Make my boxers into a makeshift white flag, march into their bunker with my boxers on a stick and say, ""What the hell's going on here?"""
918,918,3,Mark,True,19,"Mm, locked in with a mad commanding officer. Only problem is, if I shoot him, he won't actually die."
919,919,3,Mark,False,21,"Do you think Simon is really getting it on with Dobs in the bunker, or is it just me being paranoid?"
920,920,3,Mark,True,12,Probably not the most reliable spirit level to test my paranoia against.
921,921,3,Mark,False,6,"Well then, as Napoleon once said-"
922,922,3,Mark,True,4,"Hmm, what's a goodie?"
923,923,3,Mark,False,11,"""Laws which are consistent in theory often prove chaotic in practice."""
924,924,3,Mark,True,15,"Oh, God, he's gonna kill someone, with paint. I might've inspired a paint war crime."
925,925,3,Mark,False,18,"OK, OK, let's think this through. How about we outflank, and try a Napoleonic ""manoeuvre de derriere"", eh?"
926,926,3,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, or-"
927,927,3,Mark,True,12,"Right, into the bunker to save Eva Braun and cockblock the führer."
928,928,3,Mark,False,8,Where's Dobby? I thought Dobby was in here.
929,929,3,Mark,True,22,"No humping, brilliant. So, just gotta get her to stay faithful for another forty years when we have very little basic compatibility."
930,930,3,Mark,False,3,"Dobs, you're OK."
931,931,3,Mark,False,4,"No, Hans, too close."
932,932,3,Mark,True,22,"This is Vietnam. Drugs, breakdown in military order. All we need now are the Doors. The Doors! Now I remember another band."
933,933,4,Mark,True,7,My Tupperware box of tasteless misery sand.
934,934,4,Mark,False,3,"Yep, lovely, thanks."
935,935,4,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, let's steal the cutlery as well as stab a policeman with it. Partners in crime."
936,936,4,Mark,True,6,"Bonnie and Clyde, not the Wests."
937,937,4,Mark,False,17,"Well, because we owe these people money. They've got to pay staff and there's utility bills and..."
938,938,4,Mark,True,3,They definitely are.
939,939,4,Mark,True,6,"Uh-oh, need to shut this down."
940,940,4,Mark,False,32,"You think? Your life isn't just swimming with dolphins and climbing Machu Picchu though, is it? It's everything. Just drinking my delicious tea in this nice local café is living my life."
941,941,4,Mark,False,1,Well...
942,942,4,Mark,True,11,I think I hate and fear all facets of that idea.
943,943,4,Mark,False,7,"Hello, why are you up so early?"
944,944,4,Mark,False,16,"Ah, yes, Big Mad Andy or ""Big Mad Very-Cheap-Indeed Andy"", as I like to call him."
945,945,4,Mark,False,17,"Dobs, interrailing sounds great, but I was half, sort of semi-thinking of finally doing an MBA, so..."
946,946,4,Mark,True,14,Although that might be preferable. Certainly a lot fewer French waiters on the moon.
947,947,4,Mark,False,2,Do you?
948,948,4,Mark,False,5,That's a lot of cats.
949,949,4,Mark,False,1,Bye.
950,950,4,Mark,False,33,What do you think? Why can't Dobby just move into the flat so we have a lovely normal time? Is that too much to ask? Just sitting indoors with some incredibly strong cheddar?
951,951,4,Mark,False,10,"We do some very nice modern fittings. Clean lines, minimalist."
952,952,4,Mark,False,11,Right. It is quite difficult to marry those very disparate styles.
953,953,4,Mark,False,18,"I understand that. I'm just not sure that it's a look that actually, physically exists in the world."
954,954,4,Mark,False,13,"Um, sorry, Hans, this is my customer. You can't just take my customer."
955,955,4,Mark,True,4,Fuck you Dr. Frankenbath.
956,956,4,Mark,True,12,"Come on fate, this can't be right. Don't fist me again, fate."
957,957,4,Mark,False,1,Robert?
958,958,4,Mark,False,11,Is Super Hans my boss now? Have you just promoted him?
959,959,4,Mark,False,4,In the normal way?
960,960,4,Mark,True,17,Super Hans has become my boss. This is insane. Sean Ryder responsible for setting the Libor rate.
961,961,4,Mark,False,35,"Couscous salad. Dobby makes a big batch at the start of the week. She puts little notes in it, too. ""Grains for your brains"", that sort of thing. ""Be cous I heart you"", that's today."
962,962,4,Mark,False,20,"I close my eyes, shovel it in as fast as I can, open them and there's still the same amount."
963,963,4,Mark,False,13,"In a way, I'm pleased. It's made me finally decide to do something."
964,964,4,Mark,False,5,"Not suicide, I'm not suicidal."
965,965,4,Mark,False,18,No. I'm finally gonna do an MBA at evening class. Maybe get a business of my own going.
966,966,4,Mark,False,3,Meet Mr. Eisenhower.
967,967,4,Mark,True,19,"Yes, and this cat's gonna help me lure Dobby in. Like a classic 70s paedo in a Ford Granada."
968,968,4,Mark,False,19,"He's a rescue cat, I rescued him. Well, not actually me, some mental ladies whose children have left home."
969,969,4,Mark,False,3,I think so.
970,970,4,Mark,True,18,"Brilliant, my woman bait has failed and I now have to look after a cat until it dies."
971,971,4,Mark,False,4,I'll make some tea.
972,972,4,Mark,True,33,"They can live for twenty-five years. I'll be sixty and doubly incontinent and Dobby still won't have moved in, understandably. Great and it looks like Big Mad Andy's done no painting at all."
973,973,4,Mark,False,9,A cup of char? Or would you prefer some...
974,974,4,Mark,True,6,what's a blokey name for coffee?
975,975,4,Mark,False,2,hot java.
976,976,4,Mark,False,12,"Are you sure that's Dulux Heritage? Just, it's all in unmarked tins."
977,977,4,Mark,False,7,"Right, and that's definitely Breakfast Room Green?"
978,978,4,Mark,False,4,"Sure. Brilliant, many thanks."
979,979,4,Mark,True,10,"Well, I think I made a pretty forceful point there."
980,980,4,Mark,True,8,"Mmm, make it seem boring, my signature dish."
981,981,4,Mark,False,26,"I was thinking we should plan the route, meticulously. How we're gonna get to each place, timetables, hostel pricing structures. Really dig down into the detail."
982,982,4,Mark,True,16,Impressive work Corrigan. Shot yourself in the foot and then scored an own goal with it.
983,983,4,Mark,False,3,The ballet shoes?
984,984,4,Mark,True,5,Is she gonna mention Jesus?
985,985,4,Mark,False,6,So if they want ballet shoes...
986,986,4,Mark,False,6,Where did you get ballet shoes?
987,987,4,Mark,False,8,And why are you using my flat exactly?
988,988,4,Mark,False,15,"Antwerp. City of beer, diamonds, chocolate and probably Hercule Poirot. Let us walk its streets."
989,989,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh, look, it's- how do you pronounce that?"
990,990,4,Mark,False,10,"A lovely street. Let's look around, we can go anywhere."
991,991,4,Mark,True,7,This will slake her thirst for adventure.
992,992,4,Mark,False,24,"It's the... the Restaurant Maritime, which I imagine might well be a fish restaurant. What else? Six bars, a pizzeria and a large pharmacy."
993,993,4,Mark,True,19,"Urgh, she's insatiable. I don't want to sleep with strangers in hostels and never have a proper relaxed poo."
994,994,4,Mark,False,20,Sure. I just need to square things with Robert and Hans. You know I'm doing a late-night stock take tonight?
995,995,4,Mark,False,13,"Fine, I am aware that that's not the real slang by the way."
996,996,4,Mark,False,3,I'm off Jez.
997,997,4,Mark,False,4,Why isn't Andy painting?
998,998,4,Mark,False,18,"No Jez, he's properly mad. He's Big Mad Andy. Someone with real medical training needs to see him."
999,999,4,Mark,False,8,I gave you the certificate. It's utterly meaningless.
1000,1000,4,Mark,False,1,No.
1001,1001,4,Mark,False,6,You know where I am tonight.
1002,1002,4,Mark,False,30,"Don't tell Dobby. If she knows I'm starting an MBA, she'll realise I'm not serious about being strapped to a massive rucksack for a month and getting stabbed in Boulogne."
1003,1003,4,Mark,True,63,"The start of my new life. ""Hi there, I'm Mark Corrigan, MA, MBA"". That spells ""mamba"", which is a kind of sexy snake. You'll be gone by next week. Why do the thickos come to these things? I suppose because the thickos have insisted no one's allowed to say you're a thicko any more. That's actually quite a clever move by the thickos."
1004,1004,4,Mark,False,1,Mark.
1005,1005,4,Mark,True,10,"Wow, she's lovely. A lovely older lady who's into business."
1006,1006,4,Mark,True,16,I can't talk when the teacher's talking. I have never ever talked when the teacher's talking.
1007,1007,4,Mark,False,2,Jury's out.
1008,1008,4,Mark,True,58,"""Breakfast Blend"", ""Special Blend"", ooh, ""Double Black Diamond Extra Bold""? That sounds interesting. Breakfast Blend it is. Wonder if I should worry about being quite so attracted to her? She is lovely. Maybe that's what I need? A lovely older lady to tell me what to do with my life. A grown-up. I bet she's terrific at sex."
1009,1009,4,Mark,False,2,Love to.
1010,1010,4,Mark,True,11,"""Care to join me?"" You are such a proper human being."
1011,1011,4,Mark,False,3,For a twelve-year-old.
1012,1012,4,Mark,True,11,"That was rubbish. She already said that. Up your game, Corrigan."
1013,1013,4,Mark,False,9,"The key, no the biometric swipe card to success."
1014,1014,4,Mark,True,5,Ha ha. Back on form.
1015,1015,4,Mark,False,17,"Well, I was thinking about an introduction agency for the discerning single professional. Business people, like us."
1016,1016,4,Mark,False,10,"Yes, I was thinking of calling it ""Amacus"", or ""Superium""."
1017,1017,4,Mark,False,16,"Oh, that's good, I like that. You could have two levels, ""Simpatico Normalo"" and ""Simpatico Maximums""."
1018,1018,4,Mark,False,7,"Yes, I have been for a while."
1019,1019,4,Mark,True,9,"OK, interesting. Where the fuck did that come from?"
1020,1020,4,Mark,False,13,"Terrific. They do nice pizzas there. Slightly asymmetrical, which I find indicates quality."
1021,1021,4,Mark,True,17,"What am I doing? Is this business? I think this might not be business. Feels good, though."
1022,1022,4,Mark,True,20,"I'm reinventing myself. I can be anyone I want. I can be Bond. No, ridiculous. Bergerac, I can be Bergerac."
1023,1023,4,Mark,False,7,I see Andy hasn't made any progress.
1024,1024,4,Mark,False,15,Well it would just be nice if he was really painting my walls as well.
1025,1025,4,Mark,False,7,"Fine, uneventful, normal. Not normal. Odd. Eventful."
1026,1026,4,Mark,False,7,"Well, you know my dating agency idea?"
1027,1027,4,Mark,False,13,I met a woman who's interesting in investing in it. An older woman.
1028,1028,4,Mark,False,28,"No. Well, maybe a bit. She is nice. She's grown up, she wears fitted jackets. She's conservative with a small C and sexy with quite a big S."
1029,1029,4,Mark,False,12,"I know, I know, don't throw away what I've got with Dobby."
1030,1030,4,Mark,False,10,I'm not sure she's interested in me in that way.
1031,1031,4,Mark,False,4,Is that from something?
1032,1032,4,Mark,False,8,"Thanks for the advice, Jeremy. That's good advice."
1033,1033,4,Mark,False,3,"Thanks, got it."
1034,1034,4,Mark,False,2,Fantastic idea.
1035,1035,4,Mark,True,8,"Wow, you're like a sexy, human Duncan Bannatyne."
1036,1036,4,Mark,False,2,"Oh, Jeremy."
1037,1037,4,Mark,True,4,Why are you here?
1038,1038,4,Mark,False,1,Hello.
1039,1039,4,Mark,False,12,"Not at all, I feel incredibly... I'll go and order our food."
1040,1040,4,Mark,False,6,"Yes, it's very easy to remember."
1041,1041,4,Mark,False,26,I'm not even sure Dobby still likes me. She wants me to be different. And I want her to be different. Maybe it's just not right.
1042,1042,4,Mark,False,10,You're not giving Andy therapy in the pub are you?
1043,1043,4,Mark,False,16,"You've got to get him to talk to someone Jeremy. Someone who's medically recognised, by... others."
1044,1044,4,Mark,False,2,"OK, great."
1045,1045,4,Mark,False,17,"Ha ha! Yes, I can't eat dairy or gluten and peanuts will kill me. Ha ha ha."
1046,1046,4,Mark,False,19,"Uh, Jeremy, I just wanted to say that I'm going round to Stephanie's house this evening to talk business."
1047,1047,4,Mark,False,23,"The sticking it in mime is not necessary Jeremy. If Dobby asks where I am, can you say I'm doing another stock take?"
1048,1048,4,Mark,False,14,"OK, yeah, if things start to get sexy, I'll text you the word ""Maximus""."
1049,1049,4,Mark,False,3,"Right, you're married."
1050,1050,4,Mark,False,6,What a horrible thing to do.
1051,1051,4,Mark,True,16,Are you secretly weird? Have I just walked into a bear trap? People don't just disappear.
1052,1052,4,Mark,False,9,You're very attractive. He was a fool to leave.
1053,1053,4,Mark,False,1,Cheers.
1054,1054,4,Mark,True,29,Am I expecting to have adulterous sex with Stephanie? I don't know. I did put my nice pants on. But then I also wore those to the Jubilee Pageant.
1055,1055,4,Mark,False,4,"Do you rinse, preloading?"
1056,1056,4,Mark,False,2,The filter.
1057,1057,4,Mark,True,46,"What can I get away with before it's sure-fire infidelity? A kiss on the lips? Some people say hello like that. Touch the waist? Another innocent greeting gesture. As long as she doesn't rub my penis. No one says hello like that, other than in prison."
1058,1058,4,Mark,True,106,"This is moving up a gear. Am I gonna do this? Sex with Stephanie? I want to. Shit. Yes, I'm gonna text Jez the word ""Maximus"". What's this? ""Be cous I heart you"". Dobby's love note. And there's even a little bit of horrible cous cous stuck to it. Shit. I feel like Alec Guinness at the end of Bridge on the River Kwai. What have I done? Jez, ""urgent, it's all gone to shit, call me"". Oh, God. Probably the worst thing I could do now would be to pick up my jacket, walk out without a word, and return to my much younger girlfriend."
1059,1059,4,Mark,False,1,Sure.
1060,1060,4,Mark,True,4,I am so sorry.
1061,1061,4,Mark,True,6,How is this painting my kitchen?
1062,1062,4,Mark,False,6,What the hell is going on?
1063,1063,4,Mark,False,3,Don't punch him.
1064,1064,4,Mark,True,4,I fucking knew it!
1065,1065,4,Mark,False,8,"You can't punch him Jez, that's not therapy."
1066,1066,4,Mark,False,22,This is not a victory Jez. This is not the triumph of your technique. You're just kicking a man in the bollocks.
1067,1067,4,Mark,False,8,The mental health crisis team are helping him.
1068,1068,4,Mark,False,6,I want to tell you something.
1069,1069,4,Mark,False,7,I haven't been late-night stock-taking. I lied.
1070,1070,4,Mark,False,20,I'm doing a secret MBA class. It's an eighteen-month course and I thought if you knew I was doing it-
1071,1071,4,Mark,False,13,"The...? Oh, I see. OK, great, yeah. Take him. He's very, very clean."
1072,1072,4,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, don't worry about that."
1073,1073,4,Mark,False,1,Yes.
1074,1074,4,Mark,False,10,"Um, I realised tonight that I properly love you Dobby."
1075,1075,4,Mark,False,19,"And I do want to go interrailing with you. You're my ""double black diamond extra bold"". Fuck breakfast blend."
1076,1076,4,Mark,True,5,I properly love you Dobby.
1077,1077,4,Mark,False,3,Isn't she great?
1078,1078,4,Mark,False,17,"With any luck, she's the last woman I'll be pulling my pants down and sticking it in."
1079,1079,5,Mark,True,7,Tilt and squeeze. Don't be a hero.
1080,1080,5,Mark,False,14,Just because I'm very carefully easing open the Cava doesn't mean I'm not celebrating.
1081,1081,5,Mark,False,26,"If those drivers bought the Champagne themselves and were responsible for cleaning up the podium afterwards, I suspect this is very much how they'd do it."
1082,1082,5,Mark,True,29,"Anyway, I've only been promoted to travelling salesman. I haven't won the Japanese Grand Prix. Although that's probably a damn sight easier than getting Dobby to move in here."
1083,1083,5,Mark,False,3,Are you OK?
1084,1084,5,Mark,False,13,Uh-huh. Nothing to do with the bongs you and Jeremy are always smoking?
1085,1085,5,Mark,False,12,"Well, no, that would come under the remit of the actual police."
1086,1086,5,Mark,False,7,"Of course, of course. I understand completely."
1087,1087,5,Mark,True,26,Could she be faking asthma to avoid moving in with me? There's only one way to find out. Aside from a series of rigorous medical tests.
1088,1088,5,Mark,False,16,"Tell you what, I'll call the Freehold Committee tonight, ask them to pay for the repairs."
1089,1089,5,Mark,False,13,I'd email a thousand councils and petition a million quangos for you Dobby.
1090,1090,5,Mark,False,10,"And once the damp patch sorted, it's ""bonjour Chez Dobby."""
1091,1091,5,Mark,False,15,"Er, well, he will do, very soon. He started clearing out his stuff tonight actually."
1092,1092,5,Mark,False,30,"Yeah, well, he was clearing it out until he found that thing, but he really means it this time. He's already thrown out his collection of limited edition Tango cans."
1093,1093,5,Mark,True,16,"And from the way he cried over every can, shifting him is gonna be fucking murder."
1094,1094,5,Mark,False,4,Would you care to...?
1095,1095,5,Mark,False,1,Gone.
1096,1096,5,Mark,False,17,"To toast my promotion. Say hello to the new travelling sales rep for Baths, Bathrooms & Fittings."
1097,1097,5,Mark,False,20,"You can get places without cars, you know? This nation was made great by its network of railways and canals."
1098,1098,5,Mark,False,23,"Well, no. It'll mostly be buses and trains. I'll be fine. They've given me sat nav. And to Dobby moving in, this weekend."
1099,1099,5,Mark,False,16,"The wheels are in motion. The lorry of fate is... driving into you Jez, I'm sorry."
1100,1100,5,Mark,False,14,"Of course not, it's much more friendlier than that. If anything, it's an ulti-matey."
1101,1101,5,Mark,False,26,"Very damp, yes. It's sodden. Sodden. Just means very damp. Yes. Well, I'll need to show the committee as soon as possible. Sorry, one second Ben."
1102,1102,5,Mark,False,3,What is it?
1103,1103,5,Mark,False,14,"Oh, fantastic. That's so quick. How'd you manage to find somewhere so... Oh, right."
1104,1104,5,Mark,True,43,"This is appalling. Three trains, four buses and a cab. Anywhere between two and five hours depending on waiting times. How is it this complicated to go to an industrial estate in Lutterworth? I feel like I'm trying to get to fucking Mordor."
1105,1105,5,Mark,True,5,"Oh, God, no, shut up."
1106,1106,5,Mark,False,8,I don't know how to turn it down.
1107,1107,5,Mark,True,10,"And I'm here, the Emerald City, only twenty-four minutes late."
1108,1108,5,Mark,False,2,"Yes, hi."
1109,1109,5,Mark,False,8,Right. Yes. That towel rail is particularly sturdy.
1110,1110,5,Mark,True,9,"Three trains, four buses and a big fuck you."
1111,1111,5,Mark,False,6,"Sorry, I'm late. A million apologies."
1112,1112,5,Mark,True,15,Old Mother Hubbard and Captain Cardigan. Is this the Freehold Committee? This'll be a breeze.
1113,1113,5,Mark,False,4,I'll let us in.
1114,1114,5,Mark,True,29,"Operation new wall starts now. Uh, hang on. Brilliant. Gail. The only person who hates me more than my father. This isn't a breeze, it's a mega shit storm."
1115,1115,5,Mark,False,3,"Take a, um..."
1116,1116,5,Mark,True,7,"And my chairs have all gone, perfect."
1117,1117,5,Mark,False,5,"Take the sofa, I'll stand."
1118,1118,5,Mark,True,13,"Hmm, this might be OK. I feel tall, dominant, like a mighty oak."
1119,1119,5,Mark,False,25,"Yes, well, thanks for that Gail, but I did actually only ask Ben to look at it, so I don't even know why you're here."
1120,1120,5,Mark,False,2,What? No.
1121,1121,5,Mark,False,13,"OK, look, Ben, the wall needs to go. It's as wet as a..."
1122,1122,5,Mark,True,26,"what's the phrase for wet things? Not eagle, that doesn't work. I must be able to think of a single object other than an eagle, please."
1123,1123,5,Mark,False,1,Eagle.
1124,1124,5,Mark,False,3,It really is.
1125,1125,5,Mark,False,10,"Look, Ben, I need to dip into the sinking fund."
1126,1126,5,Mark,False,5,Are you not the chairman?
1127,1127,5,Mark,False,5,So who's in charge now?
1128,1128,5,Mark,False,5,"Oh, well, not sure really."
1129,1129,5,Mark,True,28,Darn fucking tootin' I'm gonna run. And I'm gonna win. Dobby will love that. Women love power. Just look at Clinton. I'll be like a very faithful Clinton.
1130,1130,5,Mark,True,27,"God. Two toilet stops and mind-melting kiddie music. Why couldn't he have just left Joshie home alone? According to the films, he would have been absolutely fine."
1131,1131,5,Mark,False,33,"I appreciate the lift, but it really is insufficient payment for my chairs. You stole my chairs, you have to return them. And find yourself somewhere proper to live while you're at it."
1132,1132,5,Mark,False,10,Stop leaching off my sister while she's such a wreck.
1133,1133,5,Mark,False,8,Leeches never actually cured anyone of anything Jeremy.
1134,1134,5,Mark,False,17,You don't have to live with a Corrigan you realise? You don't only survive on Corrigan blood.
1135,1135,5,Mark,False,5,"Well, you're gonna take it?"
1136,1136,5,Mark,False,13,"Well, if that's true Jeremy, you'll end up in prison for sexual assault."
1137,1137,5,Mark,False,15,"Buy it, please buy it. It's a tap. You sell taps. Please, please buy it."
1138,1138,5,Mark,False,3,"Right, so... interestingly..."
1139,1139,5,Mark,True,12,"come on, think of a celebrity. Not the Queen, that's too obvious."
1140,1140,5,Mark,False,6,Jools Holland has got that one.
1141,1141,5,Mark,False,3,"Right, no probs."
1142,1142,5,Mark,True,5,"Oh, no, what's he doing?"
1143,1143,5,Mark,True,10,"Mark Ronson, of course, he's cool. Say someone else cool."
1144,1144,5,Mark,True,7,And Werner Herzog's got them as well.
1145,1145,5,Mark,False,5,I sold three hundred units.
1146,1146,5,Mark,False,17,But fraudulently. I'm basically the Bernie Madoff of bathroom retail. I think I'm gonna puke pure adrenaline.
1147,1147,5,Mark,False,27,"No, that's Bernie Clifton. Madoff is... well, if you replace the ostrich with the NASDAQ share index, you're basically there. He's a dirty crook, as am I."
1148,1148,5,Mark,True,23,"Right, yes, thank you for making me commit fraud. Oddly, I haven't seen that card in WH Smiths. Oh, please. Oh, God, no."
1149,1149,5,Mark,False,3,"Yep, we are."
1150,1150,5,Mark,False,9,"Just push for now Joshie, there's a good lad."
1151,1151,5,Mark,True,34,"Is it OK to make a five-year-old boy push a car? It's character-building probably. But he is on the exhaust side. I'll swap in a bit, that's fair. Although he has got young lungs."
1152,1152,5,Mark,False,13,"Let's go? Where, Jeremy you bloody idiot. We can't start the pissing car."
1153,1153,5,Mark,False,22,"And apologies again for... grifting you. I don't suppose you could may not mention it to Robert at Baths, Bathrooms & Fittings?"
1154,1154,5,Mark,True,12,"Great, Joshie's doing a poo in a display toilet. The final indignity."
1155,1155,5,Mark,False,4,Thanks. Thanks so much.
1156,1156,5,Mark,True,13,Not letting you turn round yet old friend. This handshake's only just beginning.
1157,1157,5,Mark,True,9,"OK, Freehold Committee, prepare to meet your new leader."
1158,1158,5,Mark,False,30,I honestly think I've nailed this. I've got this great riff about bees and their role within the hive that I think's really gonna speak to people. Everybody loves bees.
1159,1159,5,Mark,True,16,"A new bolt lock, blimey. That's probably the kind of shit Nick Clegg asked Cameron for."
1160,1160,5,Mark,True,7,"Hmm, might have overcooked this a bit."
1161,1161,5,Mark,True,4,"Yep, definitely overcooked it."
1162,1162,5,Mark,True,12,"Well, those were the starters. Get ready for a fucking Beef Wellington."
1163,1163,5,Mark,False,37,"As my Latin namesake Marcus Aurelius said, ""that which is not good for the beehive cannot be good for the bees."" And like bees, we have an equal duty to maintain and protect our home. or hive."
1164,1164,5,Mark,False,10,"Oh, OK, yep. I'll just... how long exactly do we...?"
1165,1165,5,Mark,False,14,"OK, I can skip some of this. Sorry. Er, hang on, let me just..."
1166,1166,5,Mark,False,49,"OK, so in conclusion then, I promise to give us all a chance to dip our fingers into the honeypot and make the vital repairs to our hive that the current cartel of self-interested drones have consistently blocked. My name is Mark Corrigan and I am an honourable man."
1167,1167,5,Mark,False,17,"Oh, and I promise I'll sort out the stiff bolt on the door of the bin store."
1168,1168,5,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Jez."
1169,1169,5,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Joshie."
1170,1170,5,Mark,False,11,"So, looks like I'm the new Apollo House Freehold Committee chairmen."
1171,1171,5,Mark,False,11,Let's hope my aggressive land reforms don't lead to widespread famine.
1172,1172,5,Mark,False,17,I was referencing some of Chairman Mao's policies. I don't know how much you know about him.
1173,1173,5,Mark,False,1,Right.
1174,1174,5,Mark,False,5,"Yes, I know, will do."
1175,1175,5,Mark,False,1,Gotcha.
1176,1176,5,Mark,False,6,Babe? Going well then is it?
1177,1177,5,Mark,False,10,You want to have sex with thousands of other people?
1178,1178,5,Mark,False,11,"Yeah, I probably definitely don't want to hear about this whatsoever."
1179,1179,5,Mark,False,5,I don't want to know.
1180,1180,5,Mark,False,12,"Right, I'm not sure it counts as S&M if it's not consensual."
1181,1181,5,Mark,False,4,It is really ticklish.
1182,1182,5,Mark,True,32,"Oh, God I would love to pop that spot, just put a hot flannel on there and then crack that mother wide open. That would be a great night in for me."
1183,1183,5,Mark,False,29,"Yes, of course, and I want to apologise. The fact is, Robert, it was my driver's idea. He very much started grifting without my say-so. I was barely involved."
1184,1184,5,Mark,False,14,"Conning Mr. Franks. He said he wouldn't tell you, but well, clearly he has."
1185,1185,5,Mark,True,1,Bollocks.
1186,1186,5,Mark,False,2,Yes um...
1187,1187,5,Mark,True,15,"great work Mark, no need for the water board, just show me the poppable whitehead."
1188,1188,5,Mark,False,9,"Can you just give me one second, please Robert."
1189,1189,5,Mark,False,1,Hello?
1190,1190,5,Mark,False,6,Six weeks for a new wall?
1191,1191,5,Mark,True,10,I need her to move in quicker than six weeks.
1192,1192,5,Mark,False,5,Ten thousand eight hundred pounds?
1193,1193,5,Mark,True,4,That is fantastic maths.
1194,1194,5,Mark,False,21,"It was supposed to be about seven hundred quid. I can't spend that, that's virtually the entire sinking fund. Hang on."
1195,1195,5,Mark,False,2,"Robert, hi."
1196,1196,5,Mark,False,9,That wasn't us. There was also a five-year-old boy.
1197,1197,5,Mark,False,13,There honestly was one. The shit will be child-sized if you ask him.
1198,1198,5,Mark,False,4,OK. Am I fired?
1199,1199,5,Mark,False,1,Right.
1200,1200,5,Mark,False,20,I'm approving it. It's coming out of the sinking fund. I'm the chairman and I'll transfer the money in five.
1201,1201,5,Mark,False,2,"Right, yes."
1202,1202,5,Mark,True,18,"Do I look like a bloody bellboy? Although maybe that could be my new job, a freelance bellboy."
1203,1203,5,Mark,False,2,"Yes, hello...."
1204,1204,5,Mark,True,8,"don't say Mother Hubbard, don't say Mother Hubbard-"
1205,1205,5,Mark,False,1,dearie.
1206,1206,5,Mark,True,19,"Yes, can't really do any of that though, 'cause I've spunked the sinking fund within twenty-four hours of leadership."
1207,1207,5,Mark,False,25,"All great suggestions, but having looked at the accounts, I think it's better if we actually don't do that and just keep it for emergencies."
1208,1208,5,Mark,True,52,"And by emergencies, I presumably mean things that really matter, like if my DVD player stops working or if I really want a Nando's. God, what have I become? I'm Mobutu, gilding my royal palace while my people starve in their squalid AIDS-y townships. Maybe Mobutu did it all for his girlfriend."
1209,1209,5,Mark,True,16,Back from the dead. A zombie flat mate come to eat my brains and my cheddar.
1210,1210,5,Mark,False,8,"Look mate, you don't live here any more."
1211,1211,5,Mark,False,6,You mean you've returned my chairs.
1212,1212,5,Mark,False,24,"Funnily enough, the weight of your old school pornography isn't breaking my heart Jeremy. The damp's all fixed, Dobby is moving in and I-"
1213,1213,5,Mark,False,3,I'm sorry Jez.
1214,1214,5,Mark,True,14,Don't weaken Mark. He's only your best and oldest friend. You owe him zilch.
1215,1215,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, wow."
1216,1216,5,Mark,False,1,Indeed.
1217,1217,5,Mark,True,19,Let's celebrate with an inaugural stain. I'll try to refrain from squirting the Vanish till after this tender moment.
1218,1218,5,Mark,True,3,Sounds almost convincing.
1219,1219,5,Mark,True,3,"Oh, what now?"
1220,1220,5,Mark,False,9,"OK, well, I'll bag that up for you, and-"
1221,1221,5,Mark,False,3,Big mad Andy?
1222,1222,5,Mark,True,2,Poor bastard.
1223,1223,5,Mark,False,8,Of course you can stay the night Jez.
1224,1224,5,Mark,False,18,"I just don't want fruit on my pizza, just like I'd rather not have melon in my lasagne."
1225,1225,5,Mark,False,17,"But what about the new Danish drama on BBC4? Apparently it's like The Killing, but more bureaucratic."
1226,1226,5,Mark,True,59,"And there it is. Finally, a big yellow storage unit full of big yellow bullshit. She's fallen into my trap. After all I've done, she still invents reasons not to move in. I knew she didn't love me. Now all I have to do is get her to admit it and then I win. Somehow, that means I win."
1227,1227,6,Mark,False,29,"Who cares? I bet Jez doesn't. He's having the time of his life. So when do you think you might be, you know, bringing your stuff over? No pressure."
1228,1228,6,Mark,True,2,Translation-some pressure.
1229,1229,6,Mark,True,7,"Jason, the only man with a van."
1230,1230,6,Mark,True,35,"Maybe they're going to brainstorm another excuse not to move in. I wonder what she's laughing about. Could just go and ask. ""What the fuck are you laughing about?"" Might seem a bit aggressive, though."
1231,1231,6,Mark,True,43,"Five-a-side, ugh. That's where all the men go to laugh at the rest of us who can't check the brake fluid or shoot a baboon. Alastair Campbell and Alan Hansen and probably Brian Cox, even though he pretends he's not one of them."
1232,1232,6,Mark,False,1,What?
1233,1233,6,Mark,False,4,"Oh my God, really?"
1234,1234,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, OK. Wow."
1235,1235,6,Mark,True,3,"Oh, the but."
1236,1236,6,Mark,False,3,Yeah. God. Yeah.
1237,1237,6,Mark,True,12,The invented job offer to escape cohabitation. Classic. That is very me.
1238,1238,6,Mark,False,10,"You can come round any time you like, old friend."
1239,1239,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah?
1240,1240,6,Mark,False,8,"Stay for a cup of tea, at least."
1241,1241,6,Mark,False,9,"It's going to be my home office. Funny, eh?"
1242,1242,6,Mark,False,20,Dobby and me drove them to the dump. There's a great little area to leave stuff someone else might want.
1243,1243,6,Mark,False,8,"Actually, someone did take the bed, a woman."
1244,1244,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1245,1245,6,Mark,True,15,"She was very much the on-methadone, living-in-a-halfway-house type, but probably best not to mention that."
1246,1246,6,Mark,False,1,Um...
1247,1247,6,Mark,False,21,"Yes? Can I show you exhibit A, one of the walls that you started painting ten years ago and never finished?"
1248,1248,6,Mark,False,4,I'll think about it.
1249,1249,6,Mark,True,8,I've thought about it and it's a no.
1250,1250,6,Mark,False,4,How's everything at Hans'?
1251,1251,6,Mark,False,9,"Oh, good. I was worried it wouldn't be nice."
1252,1252,6,Mark,False,1,Snakes?
1253,1253,6,Mark,False,11,"Oh. But aside from the snakes and the no sleep, good?"
1254,1254,6,Mark,False,1,Right.
1255,1255,6,Mark,True,2,"Surprise, surprise."
1256,1256,6,Mark,False,9,That's probably a bit of a hazard with drug-taking.
1257,1257,6,Mark,False,8,"Well, you've always been addicted to drugs, Jeremy."
1258,1258,6,Mark,False,8,You smoke marijuana every day and always have.
1259,1259,6,Mark,False,14,"Actually, she's not moving in till next week, when Jason's van's all fixed up."
1260,1260,6,Mark,False,11,"I was worried she was delaying on purpose, having cold feet."
1261,1261,6,Mark,False,30,And now she's had this job offer in New York that I'm not supposed to talk about. Do you think she could have made that up to avoid moving in?
1262,1262,6,Mark,False,9,"So, I've booked a romantic weekend away for us."
1263,1263,6,Mark,False,17,"I'm gonna nail down this New York lie. Get her away, confront her and watch her squirm."
1264,1264,6,Mark,True,11,Look normal. Look like you fit in. Do a little run.
1265,1265,6,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Simon!"
1266,1266,6,Mark,False,13,Heard you guys might need an extra pair of legs for the game.
1267,1267,6,Mark,False,1,Oh?
1268,1268,6,Mark,True,9,"Bibs, great. He naturally assumes I know about bibs."
1269,1269,6,Mark,False,14,"Bit of this, bit- bit of that. D'you see the game the other night?"
1270,1270,6,Mark,False,16,"The- the big fixture. Oh, you missed a great one. It was a really great game."
1271,1271,6,Mark,True,10,"Oh, God, what? What? I need to write this down!"
1272,1272,6,Mark,False,4,Can I touch it?
1273,1273,6,Mark,True,4,What does that mean?
1274,1274,6,Mark,False,6,I don't know what you mean!
1275,1275,6,Mark,False,28,"Sorry, guys. I- I was going to, you know, kick it up the other end and just put one right in their fucking goal hole, but no dice."
1276,1276,6,Mark,False,18,"So, I hear something big might be happening for you guys on the other side of the pond?"
1277,1277,6,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, dude, don't worry. I've got this whole wing side on lockdown. New York-based project, yeah?"
1278,1278,6,Mark,True,17,"Hmm, suspiciously quiet. Maybe Dobby is playing me for a trout. There is no New York deal!"
1279,1279,6,Mark,False,25,"What? What? That was too hard! Someone's going to get hurt if you kick it that hard! I mean, that was just too hard, correct?"
1280,1280,6,Mark,False,8,You've got some paint on the light switch.
1281,1281,6,Mark,False,7,Is this white? Is this actual white?
1282,1282,6,Mark,False,16,"Oh, I don't want slightly green white. Oh, Jez, this isn't what I wanted at all!"
1283,1283,6,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Dobs."
1284,1284,6,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
1285,1285,6,Mark,False,24,"I wasn't pretending. I just happened to be passing and felt like a kick-around and, in the lulls, tried to strike up friendly banter."
1286,1286,6,Mark,False,14,"I suppose, I didn't believe you liked me enough to move in with me."
1287,1287,6,Mark,False,12,"I guess it's things like calling me a ""fucking dickhead"" so much."
1288,1288,6,Mark,True,2,"Oh, fuck."
1289,1289,6,Mark,False,2,"Well, congratulations."
1290,1290,6,Mark,False,20,"Well, if- if you don't mind me making a suggestion - why don't you stay and move in with me?"
1291,1291,6,Mark,False,29,"Sure, the Massive Apple. But at the same time, I've just had the home office painted. I'll be moving my desk in there. You can have this whole bit."
1292,1292,6,Mark,True,14,"Mmm, is she going to buy this? Might have to sex up the bit."
1293,1293,6,Mark,False,7,"It ain't Greenwich Village, but it's yours."
1294,1294,6,Mark,False,5,I'm sorry I doubted you.
1295,1295,6,Mark,False,5,"No, Jez, why would I-?"
1296,1296,6,Mark,False,14,"I'm sorry, I just wanted it to be nice, and obviously you're not competent."
1297,1297,6,Mark,False,10,"So, Dobby's thinking about taking the job in New York."
1298,1298,6,Mark,False,20,But I've got a plan. I'm gonna push things up a gear. I'm going to ask Dobby to marry me.
1299,1299,6,Mark,False,44,I just think now's the time for a big statement. Show her how I really feel. I'm going to pop the question in the Quantocks on the weekend. Dobby's driving. She's stopping off to see Gerrard's sister and her depressing laundry outlet in Reading.
1300,1300,6,Mark,False,13,"So, do you think it's a good plan? Show her how I feel?"
1301,1301,6,Mark,False,11,"Thanks, Jez. Good to talk it through with a mate. Ah!"
1302,1302,6,Mark,False,23,"It's very good of you to help me, Jez, but it's not the 1830s. I, I think I'll survive the terrifying train experience."
1303,1303,6,Mark,False,7,"Right, well, er, thanks. See you Monday."
1304,1304,6,Mark,False,2,"Thanks, mate."
1305,1305,6,Mark,False,5,"The train's gonna leave, Jeremy."
1306,1306,6,Mark,False,10,"I'm sorry, what the fucking hell are you talking about?"
1307,1307,6,Mark,False,10,What in the name of holy fuck is going on?
1308,1308,6,Mark,False,15,"I know she's lovely. That, sadly, appears to be one thing that we agree on."
1309,1309,6,Mark,False,13,"So, you thought it was about time to drop it on my head?"
1310,1310,6,Mark,False,4,"Well, turn it off."
1311,1311,6,Mark,False,10,"Well, try harder. Put some fucking elbow grease into it."
1312,1312,6,Mark,False,3,How incredibly noble.
1313,1313,6,Mark,False,30,"I am the very last person on this train who would lend you money, Jeremy. Currently, the very thing that would solve all my problems is you dying of thirst."
1314,1314,6,Mark,False,3,Not by request.
1315,1315,6,Mark,False,4,"Yes, I would mind."
1316,1316,6,Mark,False,3,"No, we don't."
1317,1317,6,Mark,False,24,The situation is perfectly simple. There's a passenger without a ticket who refuses to pay for one. You should remove him from the train.
1318,1318,6,Mark,False,9,"Here's a tip, Jeremy. Don't walk on the tracks."
1319,1319,6,Mark,False,8,That's your punishment of last recourse? Free travel?
1320,1320,6,Mark,True,10,Probably off to get him a complimentary fare-dodger's colouring book.
1321,1321,6,Mark,False,8,I can't believe you're actually thinking of coming.
1322,1322,6,Mark,False,25,An honourable man would have become a monk or chopped his nuts off or gone to Morocco and become a paedo or a charity worker.
1323,1323,6,Mark,False,3,Incredibly shitty ethics.
1324,1324,6,Mark,False,5,I haven't heard any clicking.
1325,1325,6,Mark,False,10,"Well, me and Dobby make a great team. Opposites attract."
1326,1326,6,Mark,False,23,I told you all those quibbles in a different era. You can't use them against me now in this kangaroo court of love.
1327,1327,6,Mark,False,7,Because you never spend any time together!
1328,1328,6,Mark,False,48,"The life coach speaks! Maybe the reason you think you're in love with Dobby is that she's the woman you've been spending most time with recently. If you'd spent the same amount of time with, I don't know, her, then you might fall in love with her instead."
1329,1329,6,Mark,False,1,No.
1330,1330,6,Mark,False,48,"Look, I think we need a cooling-off period. Just go back to London, find out what Nancy's up to, watch some pornos, have a couple of gay flings and then, at the end of two weeks, if you still feel the same, then maybe you can say something."
1331,1331,6,Mark,False,23,"If you agree to hold off, then I could perhaps promise not to ask Dobby to marry me for a couple of weeks."
1332,1332,6,Mark,False,1,Deal.
1333,1333,6,Mark,True,12,Two weeks to find the nicest ring for under two hundred pounds.
1334,1334,6,Mark,False,11,"OK, mate. Next one to London's at 12:14. See you later."
1335,1335,6,Mark,False,7,What the fuck? That was the agreement.
1336,1336,6,Mark,False,5,I just said I wouldn't.
1337,1337,6,Mark,False,6,What if I say you can't?
1338,1338,6,Mark,False,20,"Er, yeah, I just thought it might be nice if Jeremy joined us for the weekend. Hope you don't mind."
1339,1339,6,Mark,False,39,"I'm really sorry, but I had to bring him. It turns out there's something I need to tell you about Jeremy. I should have told you a long time ago but there's a reason why he's such a dickhead."
1340,1340,6,Mark,False,14,"It's ironic with the life coaching, but it turns out he's a drug addict."
1341,1341,6,Mark,False,29,"Also, he can't get an erection unless he thinks about something... disgusting. I don't want to say what. Plus, he thinks he might be gay. He's eighty percent certain."
1342,1342,6,Mark,True,7,"Eighty, nice. No need to overdo it."
1343,1343,6,Mark,False,16,"So he's dealing with that, which I think is great, and I'm being very supportive over."
1344,1344,6,Mark,False,20,"He's incredibly unstable. So, it was either bring him along or risk getting home to find him, you know. Yeah."
1345,1345,6,Mark,True,3,Change the subject.
1346,1346,6,Mark,False,3,"One sugar, Jez?"
1347,1347,6,Mark,False,28,I gave him one without sugar the other day and he got really angry with himself and smashed up a CD case and tried to eat the pieces.
1348,1348,6,Mark,True,22,"I need a wee too, but I will continue resisting. My bladder is not so easily the master of me, young Jedi."
1349,1349,6,Mark,False,11,"No, I'm fine, thanks, Dobs, but I'll cut you a slice."
1350,1350,6,Mark,False,6,What the hell are you doing?
1351,1351,6,Mark,True,9,He's gone mad. Now to stigmatise the mentally ill.
1352,1352,6,Mark,False,13,"Yeah, it's just a shame Jeremy put too many olives in the salad."
1353,1353,6,Mark,False,12,"Dobby doesn't like olives. If you knew her better, you'd know that."
1354,1354,6,Mark,False,6,"Yes, you do, you hate them."
1355,1355,6,Mark,False,17,"No, I'm not, I'm saying she's hiding the truth to be nice. There's a very big difference."
1356,1356,6,Mark,False,3,I told you.
1357,1357,6,Mark,True,2,"Ugh, Simon."
1358,1358,6,Mark,True,7,What part of ex-boyfriend doesn't he understand?
1359,1359,6,Mark,False,9,"Well why don't you go back to London, then?"
1360,1360,6,Mark,False,4,That's what we agreed.
1361,1361,6,Mark,False,22,"Oh, great, that's brilliant. Fuck the agreement. Fuck the Geneva Convention. Fuck Parliamentary democracy. Fuck everything. Is that your great new idea?"
1362,1362,6,Mark,False,13,"OK. Well, in that case, I'm going to ask her to marry me."
1363,1363,6,Mark,False,4,"Yes, I fucking am."
1364,1364,6,Mark,False,16,"Oh, shit, you got me! Except, no, you totally haven't, you dickwad. Of course you can."
1365,1365,6,Mark,False,9,"The agreement's already broken, because you already broke it!"
1366,1366,6,Mark,False,2,"No, Jeremy!"
1367,1367,6,Mark,False,2,"No, Jeremy."
1368,1368,6,Mark,False,5,I know what you're thinking.
1369,1369,6,Mark,False,6,"No, Dobby. It's about something else."
1370,1370,6,Mark,False,1,Argh!
1371,1371,6,Mark,False,19,"Oh, we're allowed sticks now, are we? It's come down to sticks. Is that what it's come down to?"
1372,1372,6,Mark,False,10,"Well, how about rocks? Are rocks invited to the party?"
1373,1373,6,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, you'd love that, wouldn't you? ""Dobby, the bad man threw a rock at me."""
1374,1374,6,Mark,False,8,"Oh my God, she's gone. Where's she gone?"
1375,1375,6,Mark,False,2,Dobby? Dobby!
1376,1376,6,Mark,True,2,Fucking hell!
1377,1377,6,Mark,False,9,See? She's gone. You've driven her off. Happy now?
1378,1378,6,Mark,False,17,"You were asking for that, Jez. Don't tell me you weren't, because you know you were! Dobby!"
1379,1379,6,Mark,True,3,Please be Dobby.
1380,1380,6,Mark,False,2,"Oh, fuck."
1381,1381,6,Mark,False,13,She's flying to New York tonight with Simon. She's... she's taking the job.
1382,1382,6,Mark,True,4,"No, I bloody haven't."
1383,1383,6,Mark,False,20,"""But clearly the fact that you brought J, Jeremy, proves that you can't handle intimacy."" You fucked it, not me."
1384,1384,6,Mark,False,19,"Argh! Argh! I'll kill you, Jeremy, for trying to steal Dobby and electrocuting me and destroying my fucking pie!"
