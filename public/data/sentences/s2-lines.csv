0,0,1,Jeremy,True,1,Mmm.
1,1,1,Jeremy,False,18,"It's Toni. She's rummaging. I'm watching her rummage. God, do you know what? I think I love her."
2,2,1,Jeremy,False,15,"Mmm, everything. Her vibe. Oh, God, why does the world have to be so wrong?"
3,3,1,Jeremy,False,14,"There's only so much happiness in the world, Mark, and they're hoarding it all."
4,4,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, what would you know about love or happiness?"
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, sure."
6,6,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Toni, I love you. I can't hold it in, I absolutely fucking love you."
7,7,1,Jeremy,False,9,"I'd like a ginger nut, if there are any."
8,8,1,Jeremy,False,15,"I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you."
9,9,1,Jeremy,False,5,"God, you're so... I mean…"
10,10,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Um, no, I didn't actually…"
11,11,1,Jeremy,True,8,"God, this is such a mess. It's fantastic."
12,12,1,Jeremy,False,18,Maybe I should send her a bit of ear. Or a finger. Just to show I'm really serious.
13,13,1,Jeremy,True,32,Jesus. Mark's such a honky. I'm definitely the alpha-est male here. He's probably here for community service. He looks like he's actually getting a bonk on. I'm definitely king of the hippie jungle.
14,14,1,Jeremy,True,10,Jesus Christ! She must be a tranny. She's no tranny!
15,15,1,Jeremy,True,18,I can't believe yesterday morning I was trying to jerk off to Toni's answerphone message and this morning…
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus!"
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Yeah, thanks, Jesus."
18,18,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?
19,19,1,Jeremy,False,2,Go... away!
20,20,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?!
21,21,1,Jeremy,False,12,"What? Oh for God's sake, Mark, we've both got one, haven't we?"
22,22,1,Jeremy,False,27,"Mark, your job is going to the office. My job is having sex. Yeah? That's what I do now. That's what I am. I'm a sexer. OK?"
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,2,Hey Mark.
24,24,1,Jeremy,False,8,Just gone. I'm seeing her down the Rhythms.
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Relax, Mark, it's all right. We were just feeling very horny."
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,22,"Mark, I'm just in a very erotic relationship right now. I mean, we're systematically breaking down all the taboos that society has."
27,27,1,Jeremy,False,10,Who needs romance when you're doing it up the bum?
28,28,1,Jeremy,False,5,You'd love to try it.
29,29,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Uh, you might want to give that a bit of a rinse, actually, mate."
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,7,Do I really have to do this?
31,31,1,Jeremy,False,7,"I dunno, it just feels almost... wrong."
32,32,1,Jeremy,False,7,But are you sure this isn't ...racist?
33,33,1,Jeremy,False,2,What?! Why?!
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,24,"It's not that, it's just Mum? Really? Mummy? I-I'm sorry, Nancy, I can't do it. I'm not getting anything. I'm sorry. I just can't."
35,35,1,Jeremy,True,23,"God, she's amazing. Got to keep her interested. Prove I can keep breaking taboos. But what? Take a crap on the floor? No."
36,36,1,Jeremy,False,2,Oh. Brilliant.
37,37,1,Jeremy,False,2,What situation?
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, right. Yeah."
39,39,1,Jeremy,True,26,"Shit! Who's Mr. New Pants? Fuck, he's crossing a boundary. Bollocks, why did we come somewhere with no boundaries? This would never happen at the pub."
40,40,1,Jeremy,False,2,Oh blimey.
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,12,"No, brilliant. I mean, that's brilliant, honey. You're such a bloody trooper."
42,42,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Absolutely, sweetheart."
43,43,1,Jeremy,False,6,Exactly. We're open in our relationship.
44,44,1,Jeremy,False,2,We... are?
45,45,1,Jeremy,False,17,"Sure, Nance, sure, yeah. Freedom, loyalty, commitment, monogamy. In a sense, that's the final taboo, isn't it?"
46,46,1,Jeremy,False,26,"Right, yeah. I mean, that was a bit of a- not mistake, or joke, but just... wrong. I mean, you can't love two people at once."
47,47,1,Jeremy,False,24,"No, sure, obviously you can, but you don't. You work out who you like best and then you pretend not to like anyone else."
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,8,"Mark, we are not going to RAF Duxford."
49,49,1,Jeremy,False,15,Ah shit. We've gone into the crease. I can't make out anything in the crease.
50,50,1,Jeremy,False,1,Tolsbury?
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh right, Gwyn. Brilliant."
52,52,1,Jeremy,True,48,"Shit. Got to stop this. Grab the wheel, cause an accident. There's definitely a taboo against that. Plus, if she got disfigured, she'd be more likely to stick with me. But what if I came off worse, lost a limb? I'm punching above my weight as it is."
53,53,1,Jeremy,False,19,"Or, listen, if we take a right up ahead, we could make it to this really wicked-looking public weighbridge!"
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,8,Yeah. We should probably think about heading off.
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, nice idea but no stuff, so we'd better be off."
56,56,1,Jeremy,False,13,"All right, I don't need stuff, either. Yeah forget stuff, let's have it."
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Come on, Mark!"
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,12,"Oh come on Mark, don't be a party pooper, get 'em off!"
59,59,1,Jeremy,False,6,Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Come on, we've all got 'em off, get 'em off! We're having fun!"
61,61,1,Jeremy,False,6,"I'm pulling your pants down, Mark!"
62,62,1,Jeremy,False,1,Cosmic.
63,63,1,Jeremy,False,4,No I just meant…
64,64,1,Jeremy,True,8,"You're not gonna out-hippie me, you fucking hippie."
65,65,1,Jeremy,False,5,This place has great energy.
66,66,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, yeah."
67,67,1,Jeremy,True,3,"Nancy, Nancy, Nancy"
68,68,1,Jeremy,False,6,"OK, so, what happens? Spin again?"
69,69,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, I can handle it. I just wasn't sure about, Mark, where you stand on... taboos."
70,70,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, me too. I break them."
71,71,1,Jeremy,True,22,"Don't stop first. If I don't mind looking gay, I'll seem the most hetero. At least it's Mark. Oh, Jesus, it's Mark!"
72,72,1,Jeremy,False,13,"Uh hey, come on, folks, there are other people waiting to… Hmm, ok."
73,73,1,Jeremy,True,11,He looked like he was singing. He couldn't have been singing.
74,74,1,Jeremy,True,24,"This is good. This is like watching a porno. Except I can't see anything, I haven't got a hard-on and I want to cry."
75,75,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, yeah. And you did, obviously."
76,76,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Clinical, more like. What you got in there?"
77,77,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Crack? Crack, Super Hans?"
78,78,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh, my Lord! Oh, my fucking life. It isn't? It bloody is! Gog!"
79,79,2,Jeremy,False,18,"Gog. At school, if you were gonna to sneeze you'd run up and do it in his face."
80,80,2,Jeremy,False,1,Gog!
81,81,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Wouldn't you like to know, you big prick! So what are you doing?"
82,82,2,Jeremy,False,34,"Business! Look at you, with your glass of wine and your jacket, just like a real person! Remember when we made you wank off Perchy's dog for a fiver? What are you doing, really?"
83,83,2,Jeremy,False,5,"What, so you're actually... successful?"
84,84,2,Jeremy,False,7,"But, Gog, I'm... music! I make music!"
85,85,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Of course we should meet up sometime and have a chat. Look, here's Super Hans."
86,86,2,Jeremy,False,9,"We can do the music, can't we, Super Hans?"
87,87,2,Jeremy,True,42,"I can't believe I'm pitching to Gog. I hope he doesn't know it was me who did the shit in his mum's airing cupboard. Please like my music, you lanky wanker! Please, please let me do the music for your Honda film."
88,88,2,Jeremy,False,1,Sure.
89,89,2,Jeremy,False,7,He hates it. He bloody hates it.
90,90,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Very cool. So, about the track?"
91,91,2,Jeremy,False,4,You want me to…
92,92,2,Jeremy,False,2,"What, really?"
93,93,2,Jeremy,False,1,No!
94,94,2,Jeremy,False,2,I wasn't!
95,95,2,Jeremy,False,2,Right. Really?
96,96,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Right, so, about the soundtrack. Can I do the soundtrack?"
97,97,2,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
98,98,2,Jeremy,True,12,"What shall I write? Can't just put ""Not Jaws"". Do pretend writing."
99,99,2,Jeremy,False,1,No.
100,100,2,Jeremy,False,1,What?
101,101,2,Jeremy,False,6,He's honking on his crack pipe.
102,102,2,Jeremy,False,41,"Oh, relax! ""Oh, I'm Mark, I'm in the '80s, I'm dying of heroin in a puddle in the corner in an advert!"" Drugs are fine, Mark, everyone agrees now. Drugs are what happen to people, and that's fine, so shut up."
103,103,2,Jeremy,False,2,Ah ha-ha-hah!
104,104,2,Jeremy,False,6,"It's Gog, I got the commission!"
105,105,2,Jeremy,False,27,Shove it up your arse! Shove it up your arse! I've got a commission! It's big and it's fat and it's going right up your white-bread arse!
106,106,2,Jeremy,False,37,"Oh yeah, sure you are. So pleased that I've gone straight to the finish line on my enormous bike, while you're still jogging along for miles in the rat race with you and all the other rats."
107,107,2,Jeremy,False,20,Great! Well in that case you won't mind if I take you out for an incredibly expensive meal to celebrate.
108,108,2,Jeremy,False,3,Bollocks. We're going.
109,109,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Why did you have to bring Daryl? He's a bit boring, isn't he?"
110,110,2,Jeremy,False,1,Strap-on?
111,111,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Uh sorry, excuse me, I ordered three pilau rice and three peshwari naans."
112,112,2,Jeremy,False,4,It's not all right.
113,113,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Bring us three pilau rice and four peshwari naans, please."
114,114,2,Jeremy,False,13,"I've shared enough rice with you, Mark. I'm in the big league now."
115,115,2,Jeremy,False,13,"So, what am I going to pay you to do in my band?"
116,116,2,Jeremy,False,19,"Bollocks. I'm a very generous guy. Daryl's bringing his cor anglais, Nancy's singing, what are you going to do?"
117,117,2,Jeremy,False,38,"Mm-hm. Or, I was sort of hoping you'd say you want to be the manager. Yeah? You could order me around, which you'd enjoy, but I'd be your boss. Could be kind of confusing, in a good way."
118,118,2,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh, come on, lads, let's lose the cone. I'm a somebody now, there's no need for a cone."
119,119,2,Jeremy,True,23,What am I gonna tell Gog? What happened to all the time? Where did all the time go? We had loads of time!
120,120,2,Jeremy,True,32,God that's terrible. It's worse than Daryl's bloody cor anglais. Oh they're useless. I wish they were all robots. I wish I was a robot. Maybe I could punch through a wall.
121,121,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, OK. Right, ready? One, two, three, let's go!"
122,122,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Look, no, all right? That's not shit, but just no."
123,123,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Hans, you realise we've only got thirty-nine minutes left."
124,124,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Yes, exactly. Exactly."
125,125,2,Jeremy,False,16,"It's under control, Mark, OK, everything's under control, will you please get back behind the glass?"
126,126,2,Jeremy,False,22,"Just get back behind the glass. There is a very clear, if invisible line, here be beauty, there be... pie charts. OK?"
127,127,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Oh, God!"
128,128,2,Jeremy,False,30,"Yeah I was really, really, really pleased with the track, you know, once we got that weird hiss off. I mean, you'll never get it off entirely, but, you know."
129,129,2,Jeremy,False,15,"So, rest of the money should be rolling in soon, which is just as well!"
130,130,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Mark, like I said, sorry if I was a bit of a cock-muncher down the studio."
131,131,2,Jeremy,False,7,"From... uh no I'm all right, thanks."
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,3,"The ""Paki shop""?"
133,133,2,Jeremy,False,8,"Mark, what the hell are you talking about?"
134,134,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Well, no."
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,7,"What, you mean, am I a racist?"
136,136,2,Jeremy,False,2,Well yeah.
137,137,2,Jeremy,False,12,"You're sure he's a proper... you know, it wasn't just racist... horseplay?"
138,138,2,Jeremy,False,1,Wow.
139,139,2,Jeremy,False,6,You mean you didn't confront him?
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,2,What? Why?
141,141,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, hi, Daryl."
142,142,2,Jeremy,False,12,"He's not I'm afraid, he's gone out, to get a Thai curry."
143,143,2,Jeremy,True,13,Because that's what we eat nowadays while you're chomping on your racist carrots.
144,144,2,Jeremy,True,11,"Uh, Mark? I've got a massive, massive favour to ask you."
145,145,2,Jeremy,False,27,"Yeah. It's, um... the thing is, Gog, he's got some reservations about the track and he's holding out on the four grand till we get it right."
146,146,2,Jeremy,False,48,"But the thing is, I've basically been very, very foolish, and I've spent all of our advance on drugs and shoes, and I really need to borrow quite a lot of money to go back into the studio and I was thinking I mean, you are the manager."
147,147,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Brilliant! Now, the favour…"
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,36,"Uh no. You see, the thing is, Gog he's really not very keen at all on any of the track except, as it turns out, for the cor anglais. He wants much, much more cor anglais."
149,149,2,Jeremy,False,24,"No, sure. Yeah. Absolutely. Of course. But look at it another way, we've all got our foibles. I mean, I, for example, hate mozzarella."
150,150,2,Jeremy,False,48,"It is kind of the same. I mean, aren't we supposed to be living in a multicultural democracy? And isn't that the point? You know, the Jews and the Muslims and the racists all living happily together, side by side, doing and saying whatever the hell they like?"
151,151,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Brilliant, fantastic. What did you think, Hans?"
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Well, I loved it. If you want to print one of those out, or whatever."
153,153,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah come on Super Hans, let's get you some crack! Tell Daryl we're very grateful."
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,19,"You want your money back, don't you? He's refusing to pay up, Mark. He's refusing to like the track."
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,6,"How are you feeling, Super Hans?"
156,156,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, yeah we have, actually."
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,13,Yeah. We thought we might smash your brains in with a baseball bat.
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,13,"See, we want our money, and we're feeling a little bit clumsy. Whoops."
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, Honda, Honda, Honda. Fuck Honda."
160,160,2,Jeremy,False,15,"Not so rich and successful now with a piece of wood in your face, mmm?"
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,15,Why do I have to... why don't you do it? Punch him with the glove.
162,162,2,Jeremy,False,3,Don't answer it.
163,163,2,Jeremy,False,6,It's not going to be Honda.
164,164,2,Jeremy,False,13,"All right, but a word out of place and you're getting the bat."
165,165,3,Jeremy,False,3,"God, you're great."
166,166,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Sometimes, I'd like to die and climb inside you."
167,167,3,Jeremy,True,9,"Was that too much? No. Go on, ask her."
168,168,3,Jeremy,False,15,"Nancy, I was wondering whether you'd consider being, maybe, my proper, you know, just-you-and-me, girlfriend."
169,169,3,Jeremy,True,4,"There's always a ""but""."
170,170,3,Jeremy,False,12,But I really like you and we have a great time together.
171,171,3,Jeremy,True,4,"That's the second ""but""."
172,172,3,Jeremy,False,2,Other stuff?
173,173,3,Jeremy,True,5,"God, suck up to God."
174,174,3,Jeremy,False,34,"Nancy, listen. The only reason that I don't go to church is that, for me, everything's a church. This room is my church. The hall is my church. Cost Cutter's is a bloody cathedral."
175,175,3,Jeremy,True,26,"God, I'm good. It's a Saturday night and I'm doing good. Come on, give us a smile! You don't know I'm here with an ulterior motive!"
176,176,3,Jeremy,False,1,Nancy!
177,177,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Since forever. Bloody hell, this is amazing! I had no idea you were into this stuff, too!"
178,178,3,Jeremy,False,15,"No, I don't think you did, because if you had, I'd have mentioned it too."
179,179,3,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah, I love hobos. Always have, always will. And they're a great bunch down here, the Jesus Cave Crew."
180,180,3,Jeremy,False,23,"Yeah, that is so whack! I mean Jesus fed a multitude of followers with just five loaves and two fishes. Matthew, chapter fourteen."
181,181,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Later, baby!"
182,182,3,Jeremy,True,8,"Mmm, I'll probably get to bone her later."
183,183,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Cheer up, Beardie! Everything's coming up roses!"
184,184,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Another cup of tea, girlfriend?"
185,185,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Come on, mate. There's no point torturing yourself."
186,186,3,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, sure, that looked terrible."
187,187,3,Jeremy,False,14,"Yeah. Well, his mum was really ill, apparently. That's why he didn't call Sophie."
188,188,3,Jeremy,False,16,Oops. Looks like he's having a bit of trouble with the Humpty. Keeps rolling on out.
189,189,3,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah. Yeah, this is such bullshit."
190,190,3,Jeremy,False,3,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Bloody hell!
191,191,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Mark! I'm sure it is in the Bible, somewhere. Probably in Corinthians. There's a load of weird shit in there."
192,192,3,Jeremy,False,5,Have you found it yet?
193,193,3,Jeremy,False,18,"The bit - you know, the bit where it says it's OK to do it up the bum."
194,194,3,Jeremy,False,3,OK. Sorry. Sorry.
195,195,3,Jeremy,True,10,So glad I didn't rub one out in the shower.
196,196,3,Jeremy,False,16,"Brilliant. It's not going to hurt, is it? What is it? Is it in the ear?"
197,197,3,Jeremy,False,3,Not doing it?
198,198,3,Jeremy,True,6,"No. Not amazing. Wrong. Think, brain."
199,199,3,Jeremy,False,35,"Yeah. Or, I tell you what, go the other way. Do a John and Yoko. Never stop doing it or get out of bed, until like all the injustice in the world is totally sorted."
200,200,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Well, then. Let's give it a go. This isn't anything to do with what Mark said, is it?"
201,201,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Because you know he's just the ghost at the feast, don't you?"
202,202,3,Jeremy,True,23,This is fine. We don't need sex. We can talk. Maybe I can get her to talk dirty while I pull myself off.
203,203,3,Jeremy,True,66,"What's so great about sex, anyway? It's all in the mind. Her soft skin is just a big bag full of kidneys and mucus and half-digested bits of pie. I bet she's got really nice kidneys. Oh, yeah, I'd fuck those kidneys real good. She looks fine. Why am I not fine and she's fine? She's probably getting some somewhere. Maybe she's doing it with him."
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Listen, mate. Beggars can't be choosers, all right?"
205,205,3,Jeremy,True,17,"Oh, right! Now, they're laughing. What's so bloody hilarious? Right that's it, that is the fucking limit!"
206,206,3,Jeremy,False,8,Hi. What's so funny? What's the big joke?
207,207,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Why, what are you doing that's so important?"
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,11,"I know your game. I know what you're up to, Nim."
209,209,3,Jeremy,False,28,"Oh, sure, yeah, you need help filling your forms in ""Ooh, please, Missus, I've been on the streets for so long I've forgotten how to use a pen."""
210,210,3,Jeremy,False,20,"Why do you even need them at all? ""Oh, my forms! My precious forms!"" I've got my eye on you, mate."
211,211,3,Jeremy,True,43,"It's fine, there's nothing to worry about. She's not fucking anyone. We're just sitting watching TV. That's bad body language. She hasn't mentioned that homeless guy once. Probably wants me to forget all about him. That's it, she's off! She's leaving me. Fuck!"
212,212,3,Jeremy,False,5,Where- where are you going?
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,1,Sure.
214,214,3,Jeremy,True,17,"Relax, play it cool. She loves me. She's not just here because she hasn't got a TV."
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,7,"What the fuck?! Nim, the homeless guy?"
216,216,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Exactly. He's fine! It's what he does. It's his whole thing! He probably loves it, the rolling hills, the heather. Don't fence him in."
217,217,3,Jeremy,False,39,"Look, this is ridiculous. We've got this massive sofa. Nim should stay here. Yeah, it'll be a laugh. I love the homeless, one of my own would be amazing. I could look after him. Not like a Tamagotchi. Better."
218,218,3,Jeremy,False,13,He's a good friend of mine called Nim who happens to be homeless.
219,219,3,Jeremy,False,30,"Oh, right, I take it you'd prefer to see him out on the street? You know, brush ""them"" away. Hose them down, put them into camps. Is that the idea?"
220,220,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Yes, he's going to stay here, unless you want him to freeze to death, or is that exactly what you want?"
221,221,3,Jeremy,False,15,"As a matter of fact, he doesn't. Some bloody guy ripped up his forms, apparently."
222,222,3,Jeremy,False,15,"I don't know, Mark. I guess that's just the way life is on the streets."
223,223,3,Jeremy,True,33,"God, she's gorgeous! This is killing me. Maybe I can just go and rub myself against her, say I'm doing ""an experiment"". No, too pathetic. OK. Here goes. The nuclear option. The ultimate."
224,224,3,Jeremy,False,16,"So, Nancy. I just wanted to say how much I'm enjoying not having sex with you."
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
226,226,3,Jeremy,True,6,"Come on, Jez, death or glory."
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,38,"In fact, I was going to propose that we should probably never have sex again. I mean, all that humping and pumping. We could take all that wasted energy and try and accomplish so many more important things."
228,228,3,Jeremy,False,44,"Oh, but it has. I feel incredibly close to you without any pressure to be sexual. I mean, these. I mean, they're just a pair of human breasts, for Christ's sakes. Now I can finally appreciate your whole body without any stupid sexual desire."
229,229,3,Jeremy,True,14,"Oh, yeah! Take that, God! Shove this up your toga, you big beardie killjoy!"
230,230,3,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, Nim's gone."
231,231,3,Jeremy,False,6,He's fine. Mark chucked him out.
232,232,3,Jeremy,False,25,"Oh, Nim, Nim, Nim, Nim, Nim fucking Nim! Look, if you love Nim so much, why don't you go and find him and screw him!"
233,233,3,Jeremy,False,27,"Oh, Nancy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Come back! Oh, please? I'm dying here. Just touch it! Blow on it! You can use a tea towel!"
234,234,4,Jeremy,False,24,"So Hans, old issue I know but the band name, I mean I know it's a statement, obviously, but what does the statement mean?"
235,235,4,Jeremy,False,5,Did you just nick this?
236,236,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Wow. Free choco. Mmmm, tasty."
237,237,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, bunch of wankers."
238,238,4,Jeremy,False,1,What?
239,239,4,Jeremy,False,28,"But what about me? None of this makes any sense Super Hans. Besides, you still owe me for the big computery thing we don't know how to work."
240,240,4,Jeremy,False,11,I won't be Bez. I wanna be in there on merit.
241,241,4,Jeremy,False,9,Just get me in. Then we'll see about merit.
242,242,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Yep! Going on tour baby. And the important thing is, I'm not Bez."
243,243,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, er, Bez in American. He's kind of like, um, you know Flavor Flav from Public Enemy?"
244,244,4,Jeremy,False,10,"Yeah. Well he's kind of like him, but with maracas."
245,245,4,Jeremy,False,15,"Playing three dates across the south coast, hundred quid a gig, you do the math."
246,246,4,Jeremy,False,47,"Actually, due to the fact of physics I'll be going by a National Express. I mean, you can't make a van any bigger than it is, no matter how much I - or anyone else - may wish it were a bit bigger. You do the math!"
247,247,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, all the biggies"
248,248,4,Jeremy,False,11,That's right. Playing at the very student union where we met.
249,249,4,Jeremy,False,3,Bunch of wankers.
250,250,4,Jeremy,False,5,How long's it take again?
251,251,4,Jeremy,False,23,Wicked. Thank God we're not in the van. God I can't believe we're going back to Darty. There's no quim likes to party...
252,252,4,Jeremy,False,4,Ha ha ha ha.
253,253,4,Jeremy,False,14,Who cares about that shit? I didn't go to university to get a degree.
254,254,4,Jeremy,False,7,I thought you did do Ancient History?
255,255,4,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
256,256,4,Jeremy,True,15,I could tell him that's all ancient history now. He probably wouldn't like that joke.
257,257,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh well, that's all ancient history now!"
258,258,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Ha ha ha. I'm going to razz those fuckers. Hey Mark look, it's Super Hans and the band."
259,259,4,Jeremy,False,10,"That guy. I love that guy, that is so funny."
260,260,4,Jeremy,True,36,"I'm pretty sure these aren't maracas. Still, I'll give them a hand. Not that I'm a roadie, I'm just helping out. I bet Ringo had to carry stuff, not that I'm Ringo. I'm nothing like Ringo."
261,261,4,Jeremy,False,4,Sure am little lady.
262,262,4,Jeremy,False,2,Fuck yeah.
263,263,4,Jeremy,False,20,That is so Pete. Fuck off Pete. It's just a little thing we have going. You've seen Spinal Tap yeah?
264,264,4,Jeremy,False,35,"Me? Er, everything. I do everything. I just can't do it all at once, so I get the other guys to help. And then sometimes at a gig I'll just cool it with the maracas."
265,265,4,Jeremy,False,8,No not like Bez! Nothing like fucking Bez!
266,266,4,Jeremy,True,29,Mmmm. Maybe she'll suck me off after the gig. What about Nancy? I love Nancy. What am I going to do when she starts trying to suck me off?
267,267,4,Jeremy,False,10,"Sorry I better just say now, I've got a girlfriend."
268,268,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Mark, you're here. You didn't say. You're here. So, how do you two know each other?"
269,269,4,Jeremy,False,5,You were in a tutorial?
270,270,4,Jeremy,False,1,What?
271,271,4,Jeremy,False,5,You're doing a history degree?
272,272,4,Jeremy,False,12,"So, how long are you gonna be down here for? Three years?"
273,273,4,Jeremy,False,7,So that's it? You're not coming back?
274,274,4,Jeremy,False,9,"So, what shall I do? Rent out your room?"
275,275,4,Jeremy,False,2,Have we?
276,276,4,Jeremy,False,4,"But, I don't understand..."
277,277,4,Jeremy,False,3,You're stalking her?
278,278,4,Jeremy,False,12,Right. Well I won't say a word. Good luck with the stalking.
279,279,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Er, yeah sure Pete."
280,280,4,Jeremy,False,5,It's Pete from the band.
281,281,4,Jeremy,False,14,Listen if it's about the amp I'll be happy to pay for any damage.
282,282,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Oh, I can work with just the one, I've seen it done."
283,283,4,Jeremy,False,18,"No. I mean, yeah. But no, yes, initially, but, I've thought about it and, no I'd feel fine."
284,284,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Hey Mark, look. They've moved the bus stop. Our bloody bus stop's been moved."
285,285,4,Jeremy,False,5,And I'm headlining a band.
286,286,4,Jeremy,False,16,"Why do you want to look- look, I'm not a student, I am a real person."
287,287,4,Jeremy,False,6,Who the hell put that there?
288,288,4,Jeremy,True,7,I can't believe he called the police.
289,289,4,Jeremy,False,14,"I've got to get out, I'm meant to be on stage any fucking minute!"
290,290,4,Jeremy,False,25,"They should be paying us to eat that crap Mark. Stealing things just makes everything very cheap. Plus, you know how I feel about capitalism."
291,291,4,Jeremy,False,32,"Look Mark, I'm supposed to be on stage right now. I was wondering, maybe you could somehow, take the rap for me. We could say I was in your thrall. Like Hindley."
292,292,4,Jeremy,False,41,"OK, OK, here's the plan - good cop, bad cop. I say I'm ill, Mr Rashid comes in all sympathetic, you stand there, hit him gently but firmly until he stops - not, moving - but, resisting. We exit post haste. Yeah?"
293,293,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Right, come on let's just do it!"
294,294,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Woohoo. Great, cheer up mate. We're outlaws. Out on the lam. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance."
295,295,4,Jeremy,False,46,"Look, I don't need to buy a ticket, I'm in the band. I'm not a punter. I got waylaid, there's been a mix-up. I don't belong here with the shit-munchers. Do I look like a civilian? You are gonna be so embarrassed in about five minutes."
296,296,4,Jeremy,False,33,"Excuse me! Sorry! I'm in the band! I'm in the band, excuse me, sorry, sorry. Excuse me, I'm in the band, I need to get up on the stage, I'm in the band!"
297,297,4,Jeremy,True,15,Shit I was only half an hour late and he's already back in the band.
298,298,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Oi, lads I'm- I'm here! Yeah it's me! I say, lads! Pete!"
299,299,4,Jeremy,False,13,I'm in the band all right. Yeah? I've just crossed the fourth wall.
300,300,4,Jeremy,True,1,Crowd-pleaser.
301,301,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Let's do it, let's 'ave it! Let's have some more of it!"
302,302,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Look, I'm in the band. You don't believe me. That's hilarious."
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,17,"That's not hilarious because that's my bollock. Yep, you've got my bollock. You're pulling on my bollock."
304,304,4,Jeremy,False,1,Hello.
305,305,4,Jeremy,False,22,"No, I'm a friend of Mark's and I've just had all my dreams smashed by the most punctual electro-dub outfit in Britain."
306,306,4,Jeremy,False,14,"So, you all look pretty happy. Being students. Well, I've got news for you"
307,307,4,Jeremy,False,30,"I've got a degree my friend. Oh yeah. I was here in the glory years. Mid 90s. Britpop was kicking off, Four Weddings had just come out. It was mental."
308,308,4,Jeremy,False,38,"Oh come on, you have seen Four Weddings? You're trying to make out you're this oh so clever professor who hasn't got time to watch Four Weddings or Ghostbusters or whatever like the rest of us? Well, I'm not buying it."
309,309,4,Jeremy,False,39,"And what exactly is the problem with Ghostbusters? Oh, oh, look how many books I've got. I must be clever. Yeah well let's have a look at some of these books, yeah? Let's see how really great they are."
310,310,4,Jeremy,False,5,Sister Carrie by Theodore Dreiser.
311,311,4,Jeremy,False,18,"""The look on her face was one of disappointment."" And that's good is it? What's good about that?"
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,29,"Oh. Oh I see. These are just rows and rows of books that you don't really like. What do you do all day, just sit around not reading them?"
313,313,4,Jeremy,False,20,"Oh this is all bollocks Mark. You don't belong here with the pointy heads. Tell them! Go on, tell them."
314,314,4,Jeremy,False,47,"He's not a mature student. He's been a loan manager for the last five years. He lives with me and he eats ready meals, and we play ""Guess the Revels"" and we watch Men In Black in front of our massive telly and we have a fucking good time."
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah. So, another notch on the bedpost. Sort of."
316,316,5,Jeremy,False,7,When are you getting back from work?
317,317,5,Jeremy,False,32,"I thought we were supposed to be living together? Nancy doesn't get back from the States for two weeks. And Super Hans is back on the rig. I need a friend, Mark."
318,318,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Nah, just finished. Green peppers won, as usual. It's like bloody Nuremberg all over again."
319,319,5,Jeremy,False,6,Hey. What's with all the mags?
320,320,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Right. You didn't, did you? Try to have sex with a monkey?"
321,321,5,Jeremy,False,2,With Jeff?
322,322,5,Jeremy,False,23,"Mark, you realise I'm bored. I'm dangerously bored. Today, I considered doing that thing that that MP and Michael Hutchence did. You know."
323,323,5,Jeremy,False,11,I don't wanna talk! I wanna live! I wanna do things!
324,324,5,Jeremy,False,13,"I don't know! Fun things! Normal things! Archery, badger baiting. Whatever people do."
325,325,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Hey, Marky Mark!"
326,326,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Brilliant! Thanks for the call. You see? This is better than just sitting at home in the same old trousers, isn't it?"
327,327,5,Jeremy,False,1,Jeff's?
328,328,5,Jeremy,False,8,"What, so I'm the fluffer? Is that it?"
329,329,5,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh, nice to see you, mate. Yeah, how's it going? Oh, fantastic trainers!"
330,330,5,Jeremy,False,22,"I've got a pair like that. The straps go all the way up your leg like a Roman sandal. Wicked, aren't they?"
331,331,5,Jeremy,True,32,"This is it. I have entered the world of men. All I need is some beef jerky and somewhere to spit. So, what have I got? All the reds. That looks amazing."
332,332,5,Jeremy,False,7,I'm hot like Pol Pot. Squeeze me.
333,333,5,Jeremy,False,21,"Oh yeah? Well, I'll stay too, friend. And when the going gets tough, you need to roll out the big potatoes. May I?"
334,334,5,Jeremy,False,2,Let's eat.
335,335,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Red sky at night, shepherd's delight."
336,336,5,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
337,337,5,Jeremy,True,12,"Hey, I'm really good at this without realising how. This is ideal!"
338,338,5,Jeremy,False,11,"I just play the cards as they're dealt with, my friend."
339,339,5,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
340,340,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Actually, I've come to see Jeff."
341,341,5,Jeremy,False,24,"Oh, yeah. No, he just called me up and asked if I fancy going kickboxing with him. And I thought, why the hell not?"
342,342,5,Jeremy,False,42,That's right! Jeff's a really good guy! And he doesn't complain that the music's too loud in bars and he doesn't go all weird when it's his round and you ask him for an extra bag of nuts! He's a real man.
343,343,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Right, I'm just off to five-a-side with Jeff. All right if I take a couple of Garfields as shin pads- Jesus Christ!"
344,344,5,Jeremy,False,5,That's why you're cutting yourself?
345,345,5,Jeremy,False,24,"Mark, blood is coming out of your arm due to the fact you are cutting it with a knife! For fuck's sake, stop it!"
346,346,5,Jeremy,False,18,There has got to be a better way of getting to Sophie than this. What about a poem?
347,347,5,Jeremy,False,5,You sure this is OK?
348,348,5,Jeremy,False,4,And knob the corpse.
349,349,5,Jeremy,True,20,"God, this is so butch. If I was with Mark, we'd just be sitting in the corner rating the alco-pops."
350,350,5,Jeremy,False,7,"What, really? What about Nancy, or Sophie?"
351,351,5,Jeremy,False,14,"So, I was gonna twat this geezer. Then it turns out they're both Polish!"
352,352,5,Jeremy,False,13,"Mark, it was brilliant! And then afterwards- er... I can't really tell you."
353,353,5,Jeremy,False,12,"No, it was much better than that. But, I can't tell you."
354,354,5,Jeremy,False,27,"No, I can't. I really can't. All right, well if I tell you, you have to absolutely promise not to tell anyone. Like, on your mum's life."
355,355,5,Jeremy,False,15,"OK, well basically, Jeff, he, not really, but a bit, got off with this girl."
356,356,5,Jeremy,False,27,"No, Mark. I only told you for a laugh so that we can have a laugh. It's all a great big laugh. You promised not to tell."
357,357,5,Jeremy,False,6,"But, what about your mum's life?"
358,358,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Mark, please don't do this. Jeff's my mate. We've got a bond."
359,359,5,Jeremy,False,9,"You don't have to ask that, Mark. That's obvious."
360,360,5,Jeremy,True,31,"Didn't actually have to say. Don't even have to decide in my own head if I don't want to. Nope, I don't think I'm going to. My brain can't make me. So there."
361,361,5,Jeremy,False,19,I've already said. I don't wish to converse with you further. You're a promise breaker and a tom-tailed tit.
362,362,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Hey, Soph. You OK?"
363,363,5,Jeremy,False,28,"Oh, hi. Hi, Jeff. You're downstairs? Do I know where Soph is? Uh, no. No, mate. No idea. Right, OK. Right, so sorry about that then, mate. Yeah, bye."
364,364,5,Jeremy,False,5,Because I've got a cough.
365,365,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, I have. I'm phlegmy."
366,366,5,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, Jesus! Can a man no longer have a cough without being taken to bloody Guantanamo Bay?"
367,367,5,Jeremy,False,6,"This could be a coincidence, easily!"
368,368,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Mark, shouldn't we just-"
369,369,5,Jeremy,False,7,"I mean, him and Sophie, they are-"
370,370,5,Jeremy,False,13,"Mark, you can't broom him! He's my mate! He's a solid gold mate!"
371,371,5,Jeremy,False,5,I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!
372,372,5,Jeremy,False,6,It isn't bullshit! Let him in!
373,373,5,Jeremy,True,52,"Oh God, Mark or Jeff? Jeff's proper, normal. I could make a new life. I could learn to like football and live with him and learn his ways. We'd have a laugh and I could be in the mainstream of the culture instead of lying like a freak in our weird puddle."
374,374,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh, fuck. I can't do it. I can't do it, Jeff! I can't do it!"
375,375,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Jeff I'm really sorry, I didn't mean to-"
376,376,5,Jeremy,False,43,Brilliant Mark. My mate and your woman have just gone off to fuck each other. What are we gonna do now? Go and make a tent in the living room and eat Dairylea? Is that what you want? 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
377,377,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah."
378,378,6,Jeremy,True,35,"This is bad, very bad. The canal, perfect venue for the emotional bump-off. 'Cause if I start screaming, there's no one to hear. On the plus side, she's obviously confident I'm not a potential murderer."
379,379,6,Jeremy,True,8,"Here it comes. No blubbing, no garment rending."
380,380,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
381,381,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yes!
382,382,6,Jeremy,False,8,"No? Oh, right. Well, in that case... Yes!"
383,383,6,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, Nancy, don't marry those gays. Marry me."
384,384,6,Jeremy,False,8,Exactly. The happiest administrative procedure of our lives.
385,385,6,Jeremy,False,4,"That's right, my friend."
386,386,6,Jeremy,False,16,"See, if it's all right with you, which I'm sure it will be, Nancy's moving in."
387,387,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Mmm, as a natural precursor to us getting married. On Friday."
388,388,6,Jeremy,False,2,That's right.
389,389,6,Jeremy,False,24,"Well, because we love each other. Also partially for visa reasons. Um, what do you want me to do with all your toilet books?"
390,390,6,Jeremy,False,30,"Oh, OK, great. Thanks for your show of support, mate. I was gonna ask you to be best man but actually maybe I should ask Super Hans now instead, yeah?"
391,391,6,Jeremy,False,11,You're just jealous because you want to get married. To Sophie.
392,392,6,Jeremy,False,21,Oh sure and I suppose that's the reason why you wrote her name on every single egg under the Word Bird.
393,393,6,Jeremy,False,33,"Thanks so much for sorting me out with this, Toni. You would not believe how hard it is to get into trainers and architecting. It's practically a closed shop. Oh, I love this!"
394,394,6,Jeremy,False,23,"Yeah, it's great though. My own phone, my own space. Might move that to there. Me, bringing home the bacon for my fiancée."
395,395,6,Jeremy,False,13,"That's not terribly important really, Toni. You see, we're very much in love."
396,396,6,Jeremy,False,18,Who needs to go off to Amsterdam paint balling in a go-kart? You know? That is such bullshit.
397,397,6,Jeremy,False,4,What's his name again?
398,398,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Wahey, guys! Sam's gonna be out in an hour or two so... night to remember or what?"
399,399,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
400,400,6,Jeremy,False,1,What?
401,401,6,Jeremy,False,4,I don't believe you.
402,402,6,Jeremy,False,1,Mark?
403,403,6,Jeremy,False,1,Really?
404,404,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Fuck, I can't believe she'd do something like that."
405,405,6,Jeremy,False,21,How could she do something like that to me? God. I love her. I really love her What am I gonna do?
406,406,6,Jeremy,False,6,Everything's turned from gold into shit.
407,407,6,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
408,408,6,Jeremy,False,2,A joke?
409,409,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, right. Brilliant. Yeah, you fucking guys. You got me all right."
410,410,6,Jeremy,False,26,"Just one thing before we start. For us to be a bit different, when I'm meant to say ""I do,"" I want to say ""Do I!"""
411,411,6,Jeremy,False,9,"You know, ""do I!"" as in ""do I ever!"""
412,412,6,Jeremy,False,8,"No, but ""do I"" as in ""do I!"""
413,413,6,Jeremy,False,2,Do I!
414,414,6,Jeremy,False,2,I do.
415,415,6,Jeremy,False,31,"It was a lovely service, wasn't it? I know some people go for that country church vibe, but we were like ""Who's this wedding for, us or the tourist board?"" Yeah?"
416,416,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Hey, Nance. You've met Auntie Helen."
417,417,6,Jeremy,False,3,"Oh, brilliant, what?"
418,418,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, OK. You're not going? No, obviously, yeah, you must go."
419,419,6,Jeremy,False,5,"See you later, Mrs. Usbourne."
420,420,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Health club interview. It's a biggie. Really hope she gets it. Anyway, on with the wedding."
421,421,6,Jeremy,False,14,Super Hans has taken four grams of coke to relax him for his speech.
422,422,6,Jeremy,False,2,Everything's fucked.
423,423,6,Jeremy,False,21,"Maybe you were right, Mark. This wedding's all wrong. It's against God and man and the rule of law, and nature."
424,424,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Job interview, health club. It's a biggie."
425,425,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Mark, what do you think? My wife was saying maybe move that to there."
426,426,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, great one, Nance, brilliant."
427,427,6,Jeremy,False,17,"Nancy, it's lovely, your dooby-dooing, but do you think you could hold on till this is over?"
428,428,6,Jeremy,False,2,You do.
429,429,6,Jeremy,False,11,You definitely do. You were just dooby-doing all over the place.
430,430,6,Jeremy,False,8,I know. We know. It's OK. We know.
431,431,6,Jeremy,False,13,I feel like every day quite a big part of me dies forever.
432,432,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Yeah, you keep saying that."
433,433,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, good. Pretty good."
434,434,6,Jeremy,False,12,"No, no, it's brilliant. I mean obviously there are sometimes little niggles."
435,435,6,Jeremy,False,7,Well I mean it's all about compromise.
436,436,6,Jeremy,False,14,"You don't think, I mean isn't it normal for there to be little differences?"
437,437,6,Jeremy,False,8,"Stupid stuff. You know, what DVDs we watch..."
438,438,6,Jeremy,False,20,"It's true, it is kind of annoying. Last night we had to watch a whole load of Robin Williams movies."
439,439,6,Jeremy,False,7,"He is kind of annoying, isn't he?"
440,440,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, he is a bit like a gherkin."
441,441,6,Jeremy,False,5,Get some Jim Carrey DVDs?
442,442,6,Jeremy,False,1,What?
443,443,6,Jeremy,False,8,Can you please stop doing that to me?
444,444,6,Jeremy,False,2,"No, but-"
445,445,6,Jeremy,False,2,They're simple?
446,446,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Wow, Nance, this is amazing."
447,447,6,Jeremy,False,1,Oh.
448,448,6,Jeremy,False,13,But I thought you thought it was just a stupid piece of paper.
449,449,6,Jeremy,False,6,You mean we might start to…
450,450,6,Jeremy,True,39,"Fuck niggles, she's literally the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Oh, God, why did I... with Toni? Just try and forget, mash will help. Mash will clog up the pores in my brain and make everything all right."
451,451,6,Jeremy,False,7,Oh! You are gonna pay for that!
452,452,6,Jeremy,True,6,"Toni, shit, gotta deal with Toni."
453,453,6,Jeremy,False,11,"Um, Nance, I'm really sorry but um, I've got to go."
454,454,6,Jeremy,False,29,It's Super Hans. He's thinking about going back on the crack. I'll get him a Scotch egg. That will usually take his mind off it. Back in a minute.
455,455,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Look, Toni, this is wrong."
456,456,6,Jeremy,False,5,Won't Tony be back soon?
457,457,6,Jeremy,False,1,What?
458,458,6,Jeremy,False,8,"Shit. But me and Nancy, we're married, and..."
459,459,6,Jeremy,False,3,But it's Nancy.
460,460,6,Jeremy,False,3,See you later.
461,461,6,Jeremy,False,16,I had an affair with Toni by mistake and Nancy found out because I told her.
462,462,6,Jeremy,False,21,Because of stupid honesty. And now we're going to stay married but apparently our relationship is nothing more than a husk.
463,463,6,Jeremy,False,24,"Do you think maybe, if I plead and plead and plead, she'll forget all about it and things will go back to like before?"
464,464,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Quite honestly, not brutally honestly."
465,465,6,Jeremy,False,2,"Cheers, mate."
466,466,1,Mark,False,5,"Jeremy, what are you doing?"
467,467,1,Mark,False,9,You love her? What do you love about her?
468,468,1,Mark,False,14,"Come on, Jez! You don't love her. You're just jealous 'cause her husband's back."
469,469,1,Mark,False,5,That's not how happiness works.
470,470,1,Mark,True,3,It completely is
471,471,1,Mark,True,42,"What do I know about love and happiness? I know you have to play dirty, my friend. Just can't seem to crack it. Got to go! Can't believe Personnel issued happy hats. Johnson's our new boss. Course we're going to be happy."
472,472,1,Mark,True,26,Maybe I should stop trying to break into her e-mail. Just have a nice big talk to Sophie. A proper chat. Really get down to it.
473,473,1,Mark,True,45,"Yeah, fuck carrot and stick, he's making the stick out of carrot. Jesus, he's good. Careful, there's man love and there's business love and never the twain shall meet. OK, Sophie, here goes. No running away, just stay here and let it all flood out."
474,474,1,Mark,False,18,"OK, thanks. Sophie, I was wondering- I was hoping that we could have a chat. A proper chat."
475,475,1,Mark,False,13,"Yeah. So... tell me, what was the name of your first childhood pet?"
476,476,1,Mark,False,20,"Oh, Jeremy and I were having a bet. Only wine gums, but it makes the evenings go a bit quicker."
477,477,1,Mark,False,5,"I can't, really, it's not…"
478,478,1,Mark,True,37,"Yeah, you won't be so cocky, Jeff, when I come into the office with a Kalashnikov and two hundred rounds of ammunition. I'm probably exactly the sort of person who could end up doing something like that."
479,479,1,Mark,True,90,"Come on, gerbil! Ah, cock-knobs! All right, what's her favourite TV show? Sex and the City. S-A-T-C. Bollocks. Maybe she thinks it's Sex In the City. Yes! I'm in! Bollocks to emoting, I've got my hands on her innards! Hello... ""Mark vs Jeff"", this I have to see. Blah, blah, ""Jeff's a laugh, but he can be a bit of an arsehole, but I do fancy him. Mark's clever and funny, but he's so serious. I wish we could just be mates for a while but he's so uptight."" OK."
480,480,1,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Soph!"
481,481,1,Mark,False,24,"Yeah, we could do, but then why be so serious and uptight all the time? We're mates, we should relax, do matey things, yeah?"
482,482,1,Mark,False,14,"Like a movie. A movie on a wet Saturday. That's what mates do, right?"
483,483,1,Mark,False,6,"Dancing? Yes, dancing, I love dancing."
484,484,1,Mark,True,18,Because it makes me look like a coma victim being stood up and zapped with a cattle prod.
485,485,1,Mark,False,13,"This is the best thing for you, mate. Take your mind off it."
486,486,1,Mark,False,11,"Um, I thought these would be... this is salsa, isn't it?"
487,487,1,Mark,False,3,Me? Totally. This looks...cool.
488,488,1,Mark,True,23,I've walked into my own personal nightmare. Must remain non-uptight for Sophie. Even if they make me play trust exercises with their genitals.
489,489,1,Mark,True,22,"I'm not really here, it's research. I'm Louis Theroux. I'm Louis Theroux. Hey! No fair, that's my fun! Got to get in there."
490,490,1,Mark,False,12,"Look, can you please just get out of my way? Thank you."
491,491,1,Mark,False,17,"Hey, Soph! I came with her. It's really hot! Do you fancy ducking out for a while?"
492,492,1,Mark,True,16,Is this it? Is this what my granddad died for? The freedom to do this? Jesus!
493,493,1,Mark,False,15,"Why don't you just say who you're talking about? You're talking about me, aren't you?"
494,494,1,Mark,False,57,"Well, listen. I'm sorry if I didn't do it right, and I'm sorry if you assume that I eat red meat and don't necessarily think money or Tony Blair are a bad thing, but if there isn't room here for people who stand against everything you believe in, then what sort of a hippie free-for-all is this?"
495,495,1,Mark,False,1,Jeremy!
496,496,1,Mark,False,25,"No, Jez. Look, we've discussed this. Early in the morning counts as late at night and we agreed no reggae music late at night, so…"
497,497,1,Mark,False,12,"Oh, for God's sake, Jeremy. I can't talk to you with that."
498,498,1,Mark,False,18,"Look, Jez, can you please just keep it quiet? Because some of us have jobs to go to."
499,499,1,Mark,False,10,"An explanation. Finally. Thank you, Nancy. Thanks for the explanation."
500,500,1,Mark,True,81,"OK, so, dance class. Ali-kazoo, ali-kazam, let's find out just how fucked I am. OK, here we go. 'And last night Mark was a bit weird.' Fair comment. 'He didn't really get it.' What's to get? 'But, shit! He came, so that was pretty amazing.' OK! 'Had dinner with Jeff later.' Ooh, naughty. 'Gave him a kiss, but not sure. He can be so pushy.' He kissed her?! I've got to make a move! Maybe I should try tapping her phone."
501,501,1,Mark,True,16,"Hope they're not doing it in the hall. There's nothing erotic about a hall, is there?"
502,502,1,Mark,False,12,Hello?! I'm coming in now! This is me coming into my house!
503,503,1,Mark,False,6,"All right, Jez. Is Nancy around?"
504,504,1,Mark,False,36,"Right, OK. Jez, why's the chair- and what's all this strawberry? And my yoghurt? Jez, what's happened to my Muller? Oh, no, you haven't, have you? You haven't been sexing it up in here with my yoghurt?"
505,505,1,Mark,False,27,I don't want to know! OK? I don't want to hear about it! And I don't want it using up all my yogurt and bloody shower gel?!
506,506,1,Mark,False,16,"Right. And love? Romance? I mean, is there any romance in any of this at all?"
507,507,1,Mark,False,23,"Exactly. Exactly my point. I mean, if you've actually done that, which, by the way, I can see no point whatsoever in myself…"
508,508,1,Mark,False,58,"I honestly would not! What is this modern obsession with... that? Look, Jez, what I'm trying to say is, so, for better, for worse, the '60s happened, and now sex is, fine. But can't we take the best of that, the nice music, the colours, the ""I have dream"", et cetera, but not have to face the... squalor?"
509,509,1,Mark,True,15,I wonder which of my treasured possessions they'll be putting in each other's anuses tonight.
510,510,1,Mark,True,42,"Next she'll be telling us to use the Force. If you ask me, Skywalker was bloody lucky to get away with turning off his guidance system. No, if I want to act relaxed, it's gonna take all my cunning, skill and concentration."
511,511,1,Mark,True,45,"Yeah, sure, honey. Appear to be opening the box while in fact, the lid stays very firmly on. She's buying it! God, it's so easy being a freak, no wonder they're ten a penny. I should get extra marks for not feeling a fucking thing."
512,512,1,Mark,True,4,"Oh, for God's sake!"
513,513,1,Mark,False,19,"Yeah, well, it wasn't really me as such, it was almost as if something was flowing out of me."
514,514,1,Mark,False,15,"What do you think, Soph? Can you love more than one person at a time?"
515,515,1,Mark,True,21,"Yeah, but what does she really think? Probably shouldn't look again today. More than once every four hours would be obsessive."
516,516,1,Mark,False,19,"Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Tell you what, I'm going off to the bog. For a wee!"
517,517,1,Mark,True,85,"Conversation is rubbish. You could literally waste years talking to someone and never get the bottom line. OK, still nothing interesting in the outbox. She needs to express her feelings more. Ha! Just, check the inbox. A-ha! Jeff. Just arrived. What's your game? ""Soph, just a thought, do you fancy going punting on Saturday? Thought it might be a laugh. Bell me. Love Jeffy."" Jeffy, ugh. Punting? Punting equals shunting. Got to get in first, ask her out on a day trip. What's a banker?"
518,518,1,Mark,False,16,"And we'd be exploring the miracles of flight and human endeavour. It's a spiritual thing, really."
519,519,1,Mark,False,18,"Yes. Yes, I know. Well, it'll be good to go to a field and look at some stones."
520,520,1,Mark,False,1,Brilliant.
521,521,1,Mark,False,16,Is there no stuff I can borrow? I really do feel much more comfortable with stuff.
522,522,1,Mark,False,8,"Heh heh, I might keep them on, actually."
523,523,1,Mark,True,5,No way. No fucking way.
524,524,1,Mark,False,12,"I'm not sure I want to swim, actually. I might just watch."
525,525,1,Mark,False,4,"Jez Jez, seriously, don't!"
526,526,1,Mark,False,22,"Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off me! I'll do it. All right? I'll do it. In my own time, I'll do it."
527,527,1,Mark,True,27,"OK, done the hard part. They've seen and rated my penis, now it's time to take advantage of the '60s vibe to get it on with Sophie."
528,528,1,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
529,529,1,Mark,True,9,"Say no, ask her to go for a walk."
530,530,1,Mark,False,2,"Sure, yeah."
531,531,1,Mark,True,6,I'm not uptight. I'm not uptight.
532,532,1,Mark,False,3,I hate taboos.
533,533,1,Mark,False,6,"Me too, I love breaking them."
534,534,1,Mark,True,25,"Oh, no! No! No! I can't believe this is happening. He doesn't even floss. I tell him, but he won't. Jesus, when can we stop?"
535,535,1,Mark,False,2,Thank you.
536,536,1,Mark,True,8,This is probably how the Manson family started.
537,537,1,Mark,True,26,"The squalor. It's happening. It's Woodstock, it's Altamont, it's My Lai. Although, Sophie's hand on my thigh, maybe there's a time and a place for squalor."
538,538,1,Mark,False,9,"Sophie, your hand... oh, look. Gwyn's feeling me up."
539,539,1,Mark,True,13,I'm Louis Theroux. I'm Louis Theroux and his wry smile at the orgy.
540,540,1,Mark,False,9,"No, no, this is great. I'm, I'm into this."
541,541,1,Mark,False,3,You're not? Brilliant.
542,542,1,Mark,True,26,"Sure, an orgy sounds great, but you're basically just multiplying the number of people you're not going to be able to look in the eye afterwards."
543,543,1,Mark,False,17,"If you're into something like that, you probably see the inevitable complications as part of the fun."
544,544,1,Mark,False,3,Isn't this beautiful?
545,545,1,Mark,False,3,Here you go.
546,546,1,Mark,True,34,"Yeah, you can keep your VD and your barricades and your talking and your drugs, I'm back to basics: moonlight, lake, cardigan. Perfect. I should do something romantic. Surely I'm not about to sing."
547,547,1,Mark,False,28,"I may be right I may be wrong, but I'm perfectly willing to swear, that when you turned and smiled at me, a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square."
548,548,1,Mark,True,41,"OK, this is the last time. I've really got to stop it, at least ration it. Three times a day. Yak, yak, yak. 'Mark was so sweet, feel like we could have something special if we see more of each other.'"
549,549,1,Mark,False,1,Hen-mania!
550,550,1,Mark,False,7,"Oh, it's just- weren't we meeting outside?"
551,551,1,Mark,False,3,"Honestly, it's nothing."
552,552,1,Mark,False,6,"No, it's not! It's just, uh…"
553,553,1,Mark,True,3,Escape! Escape! Escape!
554,554,1,Mark,False,26,"Sophie, but please! Don't! We have something special! Not my words, yours! We can't throw that all away just because I spy on you! Can we?"
555,555,2,Mark,True,17,Saturday shift! I thought we had people in Ireland to do this for us. Lovely trustworthy voices.
556,556,2,Mark,False,10,"I can call back at a more convenient... OK, bye."
557,557,2,Mark,True,35,"Mmm, Sophie, with her lovely soft face. Jeff! Can't believe they're doing the Stockport contract! Perfect excuse for him to get her round to his place, and here I am stuck with the new guy."
558,558,2,Mark,False,1,What?!
559,559,2,Mark,True,73,"He hasn't got any massage oil. He's trying to make me obsess about massage oil. And it's worked. Break with the newbie will be a pain fest, trying to chat. Maybe I'll say I'm very upset and go and sit on the loo and just never explain. Huh? Oh, God, he's taunting me! I should've made him a cup of tea when I had one. Hurrah! It was a joke! A hilarious joke!"
560,560,2,Mark,False,2,Oh! Right!
561,561,2,Mark,True,10,"This is crazy. I should be working, but I'm not."
562,562,2,Mark,False,4,Ha-ha! I see you!
563,563,2,Mark,True,23,"I'm the Ruhr and no-one's actually said the word ""Dambusters""! This is bloody brilliant! I'm having fun! And I'm not thinking about Sophie!"
564,564,2,Mark,False,2,I can't!
565,565,2,Mark,True,21,I've got a friend! I've made a friend! Maybe there's nothing wrong with me and I'm just a normal human being!
566,566,2,Mark,False,7,"It's really, I honestly didn't see anyone."
567,567,2,Mark,True,7,"Shit, what if they bring in forensics?"
568,568,2,Mark,False,18,"Oh, hell, I probably shouldn't have done that, should I? My prints will be all over it now."
569,569,2,Mark,False,7,Ian's a-? A racial incident? But why?
570,570,2,Mark,False,3,Of course. Horrible.
571,571,2,Mark,False,14,Exactly! And they'll have a bloody EU banana-straightening machine to straighten all the bananas!
572,572,2,Mark,False,3,"Heh heh, yeah!"
573,573,2,Mark,True,8,"Go on, say it. I'm gonna say it!"
574,574,2,Mark,False,10,"Yeah, I suppose she is a bit of a... bitch."
575,575,2,Mark,False,3,Good old Clarkson.
576,576,2,Mark,False,8,I'm not that hungry. Do you want anything?
577,577,2,Mark,False,3,About a million!
578,578,2,Mark,False,5,Yeah? Do you know about...?
579,579,2,Mark,False,1,Re-enactments?
580,580,2,Mark,True,12,They probably sound more fun than they really are. Like Laser Quest.
581,581,2,Mark,False,3,"Another beer, G?"
582,582,2,Mark,True,17,"God, what is he taking? Better not disturb him, he might attack me and be sick, ugh."
583,583,2,Mark,False,1,Jeremy?
584,584,2,Mark,False,3,What's Hans doing?
585,585,2,Mark,False,4,Crack?! I've got company!
586,586,2,Mark,False,12,"Look, I don't want to make a scene but I really think…"
587,587,2,Mark,False,1,What?
588,588,2,Mark,False,2,"Well, congratulations."
589,589,2,Mark,False,8,"Jez, for God's sake, I'm pleased for you!"
590,590,2,Mark,False,5,Exactly. I think it's great.
591,591,2,Mark,False,4,I'm not that hungry.
592,592,2,Mark,False,18,"Boring? What, cos he doesn't go around with a haircut and an iPod and piercings and a... strap-on?"
593,593,2,Mark,False,3,It's an example.
594,594,2,Mark,False,15,"It's all right, Jeremy, it's all right, I changed the order, there's always rice left."
595,595,2,Mark,False,6,"Four naan, Jeremy? Four? That's insane."
596,596,2,Mark,False,13,"That's very kind of you Jez, but you don't want to overstretch yourself."
597,597,2,Mark,False,18,"Heh, well, we did once talk about me doing a kind of Jean-Michel Jarre thing on the keyboards."
598,598,2,Mark,False,7,"That's not funny, Daryl. Repeat, not funny!"
599,599,2,Mark,False,28,"Too good for the cone, are we? We're having a laugh, Jeremy, a bloody good laugh! Bet we're having a much better time than Sophie is right now."
600,600,2,Mark,False,5,What are we gonna do?
601,601,2,Mark,False,11,"Maybe we should check the doorbell's working nice and loud, yeah?"
602,602,2,Mark,False,13,"Daryl, what, what are you...? No! Don't! Oh fuck! Oh piss. Oh crumbs."
603,603,2,Mark,False,6,"Jez, is there anything I can...?"
604,604,2,Mark,False,6,"But, as your manager, I just…"
605,605,2,Mark,False,4,Exactly my feeling. Exactly.
606,606,2,Mark,False,1,Uh...
607,607,2,Mark,False,11,"Oh! Uh, yes, yes, right. Yes. The Fatherland needs the Fuhrer."
608,608,2,Mark,True,9,"Oh God, I'm even boring when I'm a Nazi."
609,609,2,Mark,False,10,"Still, it's nice to get out the city, isn't it?"
610,610,2,Mark,False,7,"Yeah, the traffic, the noise, the hassle."
611,611,2,Mark,False,15,"Oh uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's what we all want, a racially pure nation."
612,612,2,Mark,False,12,You mean Germany for the Germans? You mean- this is- are we-?
613,613,2,Mark,False,4,Is this... real now?
614,614,2,Mark,True,22,"Oh, shit. Oh, bollocks. Of course, I can't just make a nice, normal friend. Oh no, that would be far too simple."
615,615,2,Mark,False,2,"Uh, heil."
616,616,2,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh.
617,617,2,Mark,True,10,I've got to cut the link. Daryl is definitely beyond.
618,618,2,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh.
619,619,2,Mark,True,24,"Or maybe I'm just overreacting. Maybe everyone does it now, and it's cool and Ali G and I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud, as usual."
620,620,2,Mark,False,20,"Fine. It's totally fine, mate. Honestly. Listen, I might pop... just pop down the uh, Chinky. Do you want anything?"
621,621,2,Mark,False,13,What about from the Paki shop? Do you want anything from in there?
622,622,2,Mark,False,13,"Yeah, I don't normally go there. They've always got that wog box on."
623,623,2,Mark,False,15,"Yeah. That's not on, is it? What I said, it's not all right, is it?"
624,624,2,Mark,False,12,And obviously you don't think there's a global Jewish conspiracy controlling everything?
625,625,2,Mark,False,14,"Yeah. If you think that and say those things, you're a racist, aren't you?"
626,626,2,Mark,False,8,"As it turns out, Daryl is a racist."
627,627,2,Mark,False,30,"No, because I was in the tent with him for ages and we talked for a long time, and it was mostly on racial classifications, head measurements and so on."
628,628,2,Mark,False,10,I feel terrible. Do you think I should... confront him?
629,629,2,Mark,False,14,"Yeah, no, naturally I confronted him, but maybe I should confront him again, more."
630,630,2,Mark,False,5,Tell him I'm not here!
631,631,2,Mark,False,7,"Because I didn't confront him, all right?"
632,632,2,Mark,False,58,"Hope Jeff's neighbour got the cheque for the window. So sorry. What happened was we were passing and I said, ""Let's see if they're in, throw some stones at the window"" and Daryl thought I said ""a stone"" and the stone he picked was a brick and well he got the wrong window and you know the rest."
633,633,2,Mark,False,1,Hi.
634,634,2,Mark,False,9,"Hey, they do chicken wings! I love chicken wings."
635,635,2,Mark,True,8,"No no, not here. No, this can't happen!"
636,636,2,Mark,False,27,"He means guys like you who are French. He thinks you're French! I keep telling you Daryl, he's not French! Come on, let's get you a drink."
637,637,2,Mark,False,26,"Listen, mate, while we've got a minute, the thing is I'm busy, you're busy, I just think maybe we should stop seeing each other so much."
638,638,2,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, you know, you say potato, I say tomato - let's call the whole thing off."
639,639,2,Mark,False,22,"Well, it's the twenty-first century, no one actually likes each other any more, so let's just leave it at that shall we?"
640,640,2,Mark,False,21,"Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I don't have time. OK? There's no time. So let's just forget anything ever happened, OK?"
641,641,2,Mark,True,13,"It's OK, he doesn't have any feelings. Racists don't have feelings, they're subhuman."
642,642,2,Mark,True,16,"Yes, little Tetraminos, you fit neatly together and dissolve because everything is simple in Tetris world."
643,643,2,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh?
644,644,2,Mark,False,1,Uh-huh.
645,645,2,Mark,False,3,"OK, how much?"
646,646,2,Mark,False,4,That's not the favour?!
647,647,2,Mark,False,7,"No, Jeremy. You know what Daryl's like."
648,648,2,Mark,False,4,It's not the same.
649,649,2,Mark,True,12,"Cor anglais, of course. Probably plays it in the BNP jazz combo."
650,650,2,Mark,False,4,"Jeremy, don't just go!"
651,651,2,Mark,True,7,"I'm safe. In my cubicle, I'm safe."
652,652,2,Mark,False,18,"Uh, Daryl, listen, the truth is I can't be associated with you any more, because you're a racist."
653,653,2,Mark,False,13,"There's a difference. Daryl, you can't hate people because of their ethnic background!"
654,654,2,Mark,False,47,"No! I hate political correctness gone mad more than anyone! I don't want to teach the world to sing, that would be horrible, but slavery? The Holocaust? That's just not on! Whereas, ""I Have A Dream"", South Africa, Benetton, it's- you've got to say, fair enough. Yeah?"
655,655,2,Mark,False,2,I have?
656,656,2,Mark,True,23,"Well, there he goes. The first friend I've made since Nick Bickford in '96. And I'm pretty sure Nick didn't really like me."
657,657,2,Mark,False,14,"Do we have to do this? We're not going to hurt him, are we?"
658,658,2,Mark,False,9,I told you you should've had a proper contract!
659,659,2,Mark,False,4,You've kicked the crack?
660,660,2,Mark,False,2,What's this?
661,661,2,Mark,False,5,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
662,662,2,Mark,False,11,"Look, Jeremy, we can come back again, he's got the message."
663,663,2,Mark,False,5,"You're gonna pay, aren't you?"
664,664,2,Mark,False,9,"All right then, we've got our answer. Let's go!"
665,665,2,Mark,False,24,"This is the whole point about contract law, the whole point of a contract is to make sure this kind of thing never happens!"
666,666,2,Mark,False,57,"Hello uh, Dave, it's Mark here. I'm an old friend of Gog's. Don't worry, we're not trying to kill him, it's just he's never had sushi before, he thought we were trying to poison him! It's all right, Gog, you're not meant to cook it, it's supposed to be raw! Can he... can he call you back?"
667,667,2,Mark,False,20,Daryl's getting the sack. Apparently he was a massive racist and not even his best friends knew. Someone reported him.
668,668,2,Mark,True,25,"Oh, shit! He knows, he knows it was me. He's got a pipe bomb in his trousers. Don't bomb me, you wouldn't bomb a whitey!"
669,669,2,Mark,False,8,"Yeah, and good riddance, you... you fucking Nazi!"
670,670,3,Mark,True,65,"End of quarter sales push. Pulling an all-nighter. One of the few in my Spitfire. Who am I kidding? I probably would have crashed my training plane during the Phoney War. Uh-oh, bollocks! Giggling, sharing. Shall I intervene? No. It's fine, it's totally fine. Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see. If she fucks him, I'll kill myself."
671,671,3,Mark,False,4,"All right there, mate?"
672,672,3,Mark,False,20,"Hobnobs. Thought you might like some, mate. You know, pulling an all-nighter, we're all in it together aren't we, mate."
673,673,3,Mark,True,3,Hope this works.
674,674,3,Mark,True,15,"Heh, mate! The magic code word. Instant rapport with taxi drivers, builders and garage men."
675,675,3,Mark,False,17,"Blimey, mate. Look at all these TVs. You can see it all from in here, can't you?"
676,676,3,Mark,True,6,Pal? Is he a pal person?
677,677,3,Mark,False,2,"Mark, pal."
678,678,3,Mark,True,9,Now we're back to mate! This is a nightmare.
679,679,3,Mark,False,33,"No problem, mate, pal. So, I bet I can see my mates from up here, yeah? Oh, yeah, look, there they are, laughing away like a pair of bloody idiots at absolutely nothing."
680,680,3,Mark,True,5,"Oh, God! Oh, God! No!"
681,681,3,Mark,True,9,"Don't tape it, stop it! Charge up your tasers."
682,682,3,Mark,False,3,That... is... hilarious.
683,683,3,Mark,False,2,Ha-ha. Brilliant.
684,684,3,Mark,False,15,Ah! This is the worst bit. I hate this bit. This is the worst bit.
685,685,3,Mark,False,45,"It's not torture, it's research! Besides, I have a right to torture myself if I want to. What are you going to do? Call Amnesty? See? That! That's the push! She can't get away. He's some sort of animal. Did you see the push, Jeremy?"
686,686,3,Mark,False,35,"Looks like a one-off, though, doesn't it? A crazy flash in the pan. Don't you think? I mean, Nancy, you're her friend. Give me your analysis. I mean, did she tell you what happened, after?"
687,687,3,Mark,False,1,Oh.
688,688,3,Mark,False,1,Oh.
689,689,3,Mark,False,2,Oh! Brilliant.
690,690,3,Mark,True,26,"She's not going to smile, Jeff. You can't laugh at someone you don't trust. It's like Mum singing the lumberjack song after she had her affair."
691,691,3,Mark,True,15,"No, no, no! Ten days! He can wheedle his way back in in ten days!"
692,692,3,Mark,False,5,"Yes, I have a thought."
693,693,3,Mark,False,9,I very much don't think it's a good idea.
694,694,3,Mark,False,11,"It's just a hunch, OK? And I always trust my hunches."
695,695,3,Mark,False,14,"And, plus, Jeff doesn't have much experience. The 2003 Scottish Consumer Directive, for example."
696,696,3,Mark,False,25,"Oh, it doesn't affect us that during the first phone contact we're obliged to set out, without abbreviation, the terms of a standard repayment plan?"
697,697,3,Mark,True,12,"I've shot you, Jeff, with a bullet made of Scottish finance regulations!"
698,698,3,Mark,False,9,"Yeah, Alan, I suppose I could probably make that."
699,699,3,Mark,True,17,Even if I have to cut off all my limbs and crawl to Aberdeen on my tongue.
700,700,3,Mark,False,9,I can't believe he's wormed his way back in.
701,701,3,Mark,False,30,"Bastard! Perfect alibi. Still, thanks for that heads up on the date, mate. Great to be able to monitor. And if anyone asks, we're just having a lovely innocent picnic!"
702,702,3,Mark,False,15,"Brilliant. Although, apparently, she finds that amusing. They're laughing, Jez! They're having a good time!"
703,703,3,Mark,True,31,"Got to stop it. Throw a snack. Hit him on the head. No. Get them to film it. Build up a library of taped evidence. Right, evidence that I'm an obsessive voyeur."
704,704,3,Mark,False,45,"Yes, I suppose the news should be a dispassionate list of all the events that have occurred the world over during the day. That would be good. Except, of course, it would take forever! That's- that's- that's our picnic! You can't see the kettle chips."
705,705,3,Mark,False,8,"I wasn't drinking, I was having a picnic!"
706,706,3,Mark,False,43,"Hello? Mum, we were having a picnic. Tell Dad it was a picnic. You can't see the crisps! We had three different flavours of crisps! Explain to him. And Scotch eggs! Yeah, no, really, I'm- I'm fine. Listen, I've got to go. Cock knobs!"
707,707,3,Mark,False,9,"Oh, right. You believe in a god, do you?"
708,708,3,Mark,False,11,"Nancy, there's no evidence for God, whereas Ofcom has published guidelines."
709,709,3,Mark,False,48,"Oh, yes, the Bible. And I wonder what the Bible's view is on you doing it in the shower and the garden centre and up the bum. I mean, that's all right, is it, that's in the Bible? Or do you think maybe that's not in the Bible?"
710,710,3,Mark,True,41,"Are they staring? They're all staring at the drunk off the news. Yeah, well, fuck them! Me and Sophie are going to. I'll make everything all right in Aberdeen. They're probably not even staring. Just being paranoid, as usual. Oh, fuck!"
711,711,3,Mark,False,32,"All right. Ha-ha. Very funny. Yeah, I can take a joke as well as anyone else, but, if there are any more jokes, I'm taking it to a fucking industrial tribunal, OK?"
712,712,3,Mark,False,12,Let me explain. It was a picnic. I'm currently speaking to Ofcom.
713,713,3,Mark,False,8,"I mean, we had three flavours of crisps."
714,714,3,Mark,False,6,"Good. Well, I'm glad you understand."
715,715,3,Mark,False,3,"No, Alan, I-"
716,716,3,Mark,False,5,"Alan, I'm not an alcoholic."
717,717,3,Mark,True,27,"I've got to go to Aberdeen. I've got the Rough Guide! I could always sell it on eBay. No, I've got to go to Aberdeen with Sophie!"
718,718,3,Mark,False,38,"Hello. My- my name's Mark and I'm an alcoholic. Er... so, I'm a lager drinker, mainly. I think I had my first one when I was about fourteen. Hofmeister. You remember? The bear with the porkpie hat. Yeah."
719,719,3,Mark,True,3,"Surely, that's enough."
720,720,3,Mark,False,14,"Yeah, so lately, it's got really bad. I've been on the rum and Coke."
721,721,3,Mark,True,1,More?
722,722,3,Mark,False,46,"And vodka and gin. All mixed up. It's not even a proper cocktail, it's just made-up. And I just drink that and stay at home. And eat oven chips out of the bag, frozen, until I throw up on myself. That's how pissed I've been. Thanks."
723,723,3,Mark,True,14,"God, they'll believe anything! All you've got to do is turn up and moan."
724,724,3,Mark,False,52,"I'm fine, Dad. Please. There's no need to come and stay. I know it was on the news, but you know what the news is like these days, they just make it all up. No, no, no, no. OK but please don't use that voice. All right. See you at the station."
725,725,3,Mark,False,1,Hello.
726,726,3,Mark,False,14,"Jez, there's someone I don't know sitting on the sofa eating my Sara Lee."
727,727,3,Mark,False,6,"He's not staying here, is he?"
728,728,3,Mark,False,5,"No, of course it isn't."
729,729,3,Mark,False,9,"No! Look, he must have some benefits or something?"
730,730,3,Mark,False,7,Why on earth would they do that?
731,731,3,Mark,False,68,"Listen, Nim, I feel awful, but, the thing is, my dad's coming to stay and he considers Sir David Frost to be something of a hippie. So you're going to have to leave. I'm sorry. I wouldn't normally do this. I mean, I have a standing order to the Royal National Lifeboat Institute. That's the kind of guy I am. Maybe you can take some comfort from that?"
732,732,3,Mark,False,27,"Soph, I just wanted to say, if we do end up going up the Highlands together I not only expect, but will insist on separate rooms because…"
733,733,3,Mark,False,11,Alan! It's not what it looks like! It's only a pint.
734,734,3,Mark,False,15,I didn't even want it. Sophie bought it for me. I asked for a Coke.
735,735,3,Mark,False,2,No. Alan!
736,736,3,Mark,True,19,"Ugh! Kaliber! Of course, Kaliber! Why didn't I say it was Kaliber? Kaliber would have made everything all right."
737,737,3,Mark,True,20,"OK, I'm going to Aberdeen. I'm going, Jeff. In a canoe made of your skin, wearing your nuts as earrings."
738,738,3,Mark,False,3,"All right, Jeff?"
739,739,3,Mark,False,13,"So, say, tell you what, Jeff. I had a great shag last night."
740,740,3,Mark,False,4,Yeah. With your mum.
741,741,3,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, really doing it, we were."
742,742,3,Mark,False,7,"Otherwise what? What's gonna happen, you homo?"
743,743,3,Mark,False,15,"Stolen any good cars lately, Mr Scouser? Where's your native wit now, eh, Mr Stupid?"
744,744,3,Mark,False,29,"Come on, Jeff. Let's get down to it, shall we? Come on, you stupid stinking chicken fucker. Oh, those chickens really love it when that big rooster Jeff comes a-calling."
745,745,3,Mark,True,7,Argh! He's bloody broken my beautiful nose!
746,746,3,Mark,False,16,"That should be more than enough for Personnel to go on, don't you think? Goodbye, Jeff!"
747,747,3,Mark,False,14,Where's- where's the other one? You're not the one I bought the lager for.
748,748,3,Mark,False,30,"But he was supposed to tape the- me and Jeff in the room. He must have taped it. Oh, shit! Look, mate, pal. You've got to do me a favour."
749,749,3,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Jeff."
750,750,3,Mark,False,13,"Yeah, so, like I was saying. Your mum. I had sex with her."
751,751,3,Mark,False,5,"Yeah, and it was great."
752,752,3,Mark,False,5,"Come on, you big pussy!"
753,753,3,Mark,False,26,"Come on, dick cheese! Piss teeth! Fish lips! Come on! Have another crack at me, Jeff! Go on, I'll fight back this time! Hit me, Jeff!"
754,754,3,Mark,True,15,It's OK. I'll get him at the bus stop. There's CCTV at the bus stop.
755,755,4,Mark,True,54,"Shoes. The boring-est purchase. If only Sophie was here. We could horse around, try on flip-flops and spray suede protector about. Come on Mark, it's Sophie and Jeff now, and that's fine. It's not Armageddon. Come on man, relax, live a little. Could get brown brogues. Best stick to black. Don't want to go completely mental."
756,756,4,Mark,False,27,"Oh, yeah, thanks. Yes I'm after some shoes. Nothing too fancy. I did think brown brogues but you know, I don't want to look like a spiv."
757,757,4,Mark,True,15,"Spiv? Of course, because this is 1942. Come on Mark, she's only a nice girl."
758,758,4,Mark,False,17,"No it's fine. So I was thinking black, size 8, but broad. I have a broad foot."
759,759,4,Mark,False,9,No it's fine I just thought they were broad.
760,760,4,Mark,True,5,"Keep feeling my foot, please."
761,761,4,Mark,False,11,No I thought it was funny. I like ancient Egypt too.
762,762,4,Mark,True,15,"She knows about cubits, she's not comfortable in her own skin. She's one of me!"
763,763,4,Mark,True,44,"It's cool, I'm not a stalker. I thank shop girls for their advice with chocolates. I just happened to pop by a couple of days later to let her know I've broken them in. That's my line, there's no way they can prove otherwise."
764,764,4,Mark,False,2,Excuse me.
765,765,4,Mark,False,13,"I'm looking for someone who helped me, er... April. I'm a friend and-"
766,766,4,Mark,False,7,"Yeah. What is this, the third degree?"
767,767,4,Mark,False,19,Ah! Of course. Of course she is. We were talking about that last time I saw her. OK thanks.
768,768,4,Mark,True,6,"Do a Columbo, do a Columbo!"
769,769,4,Mark,False,11,"Just remind me, which university was it April's gone to again?"
770,770,4,Mark,False,5,Dartmouth. Of course. Dartmouth. Thanks.
771,771,4,Mark,True,13,"Good old Columbo. Just the one technique of course. Still, shits on Quincy."
772,772,4,Mark,False,10,"-s. So what, you're all piling round in a van?"
773,773,4,Mark,False,4,-s. Maths. Where you going?
774,774,4,Mark,False,1,Dartmouth?
775,775,4,Mark,False,1,Cool.
776,776,4,Mark,True,11,"This isn't stalking. I want to see the band, support Jez."
777,777,4,Mark,False,5,"So, they good this band?"
778,778,4,Mark,False,10,"Brilliant, well I'd love to come and see them then."
779,779,4,Mark,False,14,"Hey I bet you don't get these in the van. Air on, or off."
780,780,4,Mark,False,6,Just eight and three quarter hours.
781,781,4,Mark,False,6,...like the quim down in Darty.
782,782,4,Mark,False,13,Yeah those were the days. Did you ever appeal about your degree mark?
783,783,4,Mark,False,16,"No, of course. Anyway, no use regretting the past. I wish I'd done Ancient History but-"
784,784,4,Mark,False,16,I did Business Studies Jeremy. For three years. And I talked to you about it daily.
785,785,4,Mark,True,60,"You won't be laughing so hard when the loan repayments kick in, buddy. I suppose he can always defer. OK, it's showtime. What's the line? What's the line? Just swinging through town, thought I'd check what's hot at the arts fac! Yeah and after she's thrown up we can go for a pizza. Is that her? I think that's her."
786,786,4,Mark,False,5,Hello? Hi. Sorry. H- Hello?
787,787,4,Mark,True,40,"Shit, shit where's she going? I'm not licensed to be in this far. I'm following her! Shit. What am I gonna do next, take secret photos and blow them up on my wall and lie masturbating in my own filth?"
788,788,4,Mark,False,14,"Er... the shoe shop? Black brogues? I thought I was broad-footed, you felt otherwise."
789,789,4,Mark,False,2,"Er, yeah."
790,790,4,Mark,False,1,Professor…
791,791,4,Mark,True,3,Netball? Keyser Söze?
792,792,4,Mark,False,1,MacLeish.
793,793,4,Mark,True,19,"Why am I walking into the jaws of death? The jaws of death are best avoided, that's common knowledge."
794,794,4,Mark,False,1,Me?
795,795,4,Mark,True,11,This is my moment of madness. This is my Clapham Common.
796,796,4,Mark,False,35,"No I'm new, I'm mature. I went to Coventry for a week, in error. Lovely. Totally destroyed in the war, obviously. But, there was a mix-up. I'm not on the forms but I'm, here now."
797,797,4,Mark,True,35,"Is that it? Is that how easy it is to steal some education? Bloody hell, who's in charge? The world's just people walking around, going into rooms and saying things. It's all a big swizzle."
798,798,4,Mark,False,17,"Not that old fallacy! But, the Romans didn't even station a legion in Galilee until, what, 130AD?"
799,799,4,Mark,False,9,"But, I suppose all research funding leads to Rome."
800,800,4,Mark,False,3,Corrigan. Mark Corrigan.
801,801,4,Mark,True,18,"I'm doing it Dad! I'm studying ancient history, and there's not a thing you can do about it."
802,802,4,Mark,False,1,Sure.
803,803,4,Mark,True,32,I'm being ushered into the inner ring. I knew there was an inner ring. I bet they make jokes about the Atkins diet and do prank calls to Gore Vidal in Esperanto!
804,804,4,Mark,False,12,Fuck it. Just get another one. You can always defer. To university!
805,805,4,Mark,True,32,"Oh God she is just so lovely and she doesn't even realise it. Probably no one's ever told her. I should tell her. No, don't tell her. If she realises, I'm finished."
806,806,4,Mark,False,25,"Oh let's not talk about that shit. This is what I do, I come from here. We're all people after all, with hands and feet."
807,807,4,Mark,False,15,Yeah well I know I party pretty hard but I do occasionally go to tutorials.
808,808,4,Mark,False,15,"Well I mean, you've got to go to tutorials if you're doing a history degree."
809,809,4,Mark,False,20,"That's right Jeremy! He's in a band, I got a lift down with him. His hearing's gone! All the gigs."
810,810,4,Mark,False,11,"Well that's how long undergraduate degrees are, last time I checked."
811,811,4,Mark,False,1,Nope.
812,812,4,Mark,False,12,"Well, of course rent out the room. We've been over this Jeremy."
813,813,4,Mark,False,3,That's right Jeremy.
814,814,4,Mark,False,15,"Come on, let me get you a drink and I'll explain everything all over again."
815,815,4,Mark,False,6,"No! It's a passionate, romantic gesture."
816,816,4,Mark,False,4,I'm not stalking her.
817,817,4,Mark,True,44,"How cheap dare I go? Professor MacLeish said party, it's gonna get jumbled in the common lot. I could risk breaking the two ninety-nine barrier! Ha ha. There be monsters! I'll dump this and drink the communal lager. I think I know who's winning."
818,818,4,Mark,False,14,You couldn't ask Mr Rashid if he's got anything cheaper than this could you?
819,819,4,Mark,False,1,OK.
820,820,4,Mark,True,2,Fair enough.
821,821,4,Mark,False,31,"Everything changes Jeremy. Five years ago I'd have cut of my right leg just to be able to speak to Professor MacLeish, now I'm going to his house for a party!"
822,822,4,Mark,False,27,"Mr Rashid don't be ridiculous, it's us remember? The El Dude brothers. You gave us that out-of-date hummus, Jez was really ill, and we laughed about it!"
823,823,4,Mark,False,13,What the hell were you thinking? Why didn't you just pay for it?
824,824,4,Mark,False,2,"Yes, confused."
825,825,4,Mark,False,27,No way Jeremy. Right now April's probably getting chatted up by some student who's also worked out she's got the magical combo of beauty and low self-esteem.
826,826,4,Mark,False,16,We murder Mr Rashid. What is it with you and stealing and murdering today? You're mad on it!
827,827,4,Mark,False,34,"No Jeremy! There's procedures, forms, we need to go through the proper channels! All right, all right. Since you're so set on a life of crime, no pointing in adding criminal damage as well."
828,828,4,Mark,False,8,I'm gonna leave a tenner and a note.
829,829,4,Mark,False,21,"I was like, yeah the book's based on good source material, unfortunately the source material appears to be Asterix The Gaul!"
830,830,4,Mark,False,13,"Love to, I could lay into his whole accessible, interesting take on things."
831,831,4,Mark,True,10,To enter the elite I must shit on my heroes.
832,832,4,Mark,True,38,"I can pen insights from the safety of the flat. The Zorro of academia. Who is that masked intellectual who so pricks our pomposity? Ooh that's rough. Miscalculated. Dinner party. Still, if I drink the whole thing, no one need know."
833,833,4,Mark,False,11,"It's just, mine. I like to know how much I've drunk."
834,834,4,Mark,False,10,"No, I just like to know, in case anything happens."
835,835,4,Mark,True,6,He thinks I mean date rape.
836,836,4,Mark,False,5,"Not, date rape. Other things."
837,837,4,Mark,False,13,"Hey April, come and join us, we were just talking about my column."
838,838,4,Mark,False,3,Great ha ha!
839,839,4,Mark,True,11,"Plays, wine, Lesbos. I've arrived. Just don't mention Bravo Two Zero."
840,840,4,Mark,True,18,Bollocks! he shouldn't be here! There's limited room in the inner ring. That's why it's the inner ring.
841,841,4,Mark,False,11,"It's a film, Alistair, very popular at the time. About weddings."
842,842,4,Mark,False,5,Jeremy don't manhandle the books!
843,843,4,Mark,False,16,"Look, Jez, why don't you go and lie down in the recovery position for a while."
844,844,4,Mark,False,9,Tell them what? That I'm a hard-working mature student?
845,845,4,Mark,False,10,"I- I manage my student loan! I manage, on it."
846,846,4,Mark,False,17,"April listen, I was thinking. I should really go, do you want to go, now, with me?"
847,847,4,Mark,False,19,"Or, I've got six quid, let's get a couple of bottles or Thunderbird, see who can drink theirs fastest."
848,848,4,Mark,False,33,"Keyser Söze Hall. Do you know it? Very ugly, horribly ugly, it's for mature students. They try and lock us all away in case we infect you with our diligence and lust for knowledge."
849,849,4,Mark,True,16,"OK, dangerously close to getting what I want. Feels a bit weird. Don't think about Sophie."
850,850,4,Mark,False,3,Love your room.
851,851,4,Mark,False,16,Oh yeah. Great sex-and-suicide flick. Turned a whole generation of men onto girls with mental illness.
852,852,4,Mark,True,43,"Perfect. The kind of scenario that used to terrify me, but now I can totally handle. Just lean in, or pull her towards me and just simply- this is my chance! And I'm doing nothing, I am now, this instant, missing my chance."
853,853,4,Mark,False,11,"Er, yeah, OK, right. I might go then. See you soon."
854,854,4,Mark,True,14,"Oh well, I kept myself pure for Sophie. Yeah like nuns do for Christ."
855,855,4,Mark,True,13,I'm not sleeping with him. Come on! She can only hurt me emotionally.
856,856,4,Mark,False,42,"Look, just now I- I wanted to make the move. And, I just wanna know if I make the move now, even though admittedly the moment has, sort of, gone. You're not gonna back away, or look disgusted or anything, are you?"
857,857,4,Mark,False,2,Great. Thanks.
858,858,4,Mark,False,1,OK.
859,859,4,Mark,False,74,"Hi Sophie, it's Mark here, sorry to call so late. I just wanted to leave you a message to remind you to print out the proposal docs for the big meet tomorrow at 5pm. Anyway I'm just down in Dartmouth at the moment with a lovely young student girl, things are going pretty well. I just made the move which went brilliantly and so now we're probably gonna go to bed. Anyway see you tomorrow, bye."
860,860,4,Mark,False,5,And I really like you.
861,861,4,Mark,False,2,Another night?
862,862,4,Mark,True,12,"That'd be fine, if I hadn't lied about everything except my name."
863,863,4,Mark,False,9,"No, it's got to be- it should be, tonight."
864,864,4,Mark,False,10,"Let's, tonight. I really feel that the mood's right tonight."
865,865,4,Mark,False,4,"Oh, right. Nice cuddle."
866,866,4,Mark,False,32,"Hi. Oh, hello Sophie. Yes, I'm very sorry to have called you so late. I just thought you might have been interested in how things were going for me. But you're not."
867,867,4,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, see you after the lecture."
868,868,4,Mark,True,13,At least I never had to watch her recoil at my scrotal scar.
869,869,4,Mark,False,14,"She would have done it. Given another night or two, she definitely would have."
870,870,4,Mark,True,13,"This is OK, this is just a moment that will haunt me forever."
871,871,5,Mark,False,15,"Hey! Soph, just heard the Shapeero Finance presentation's been cancelled. Rod Stamp's gone hyperglycaemic again."
872,872,5,Mark,False,25,"Yeah, I know. Terrible. Still, on the bright side, free hour! Wanna come and see if marketing have left any biscuits in Meeting Room B?"
873,873,5,Mark,False,1,Oh?
874,874,5,Mark,False,21,"Old fashioned? Right, what's next? Put you in a chastity belt and make you... drive around in an old fashioned car?"
875,875,5,Mark,False,14,Move in? That won't help! What about giving him some space? That might help!
876,876,5,Mark,True,13,I'm staring into the abyss. I don't like the look of the abyss.
877,877,5,Mark,False,1,Thanks.
878,878,5,Mark,True,13,Maybe I can fill the abyss with lots and lots of urgent calls.
879,879,5,Mark,False,1,Hello?
880,880,5,Mark,False,12,"What? six-thirty just like normal. Look, you said it was urgent, Jeremy!"
881,881,5,Mark,False,9,"Look Jez, just relax. Isn't Ready, Steady, Cook on?"
882,882,5,Mark,False,15,"Look, there's some chocolate hidden in the fridge under the egg tray. See you tonight!"
883,883,5,Mark,True,74,"OK, going undercover. Jeff's apparent mate, who couldn't possibly be trying to nick his bird from right under his stupid old fashioned nose. Mmm, OK, man-chat topics. Footballer Darren Anderton, figure of ridicule due to repeated injuries. Turkish shepherd, ate his own testicles. NB, ignore tragic earthquake context. Ferrari Testarossa, fast car. Obviously, no need to note that. Shit, I'm making too many notes! Just imbibe the culture. Um, yes. Civilisation is definitely doomed."
884,884,5,Mark,False,14,"If you can't have sex with the monkey, make friends with the organ grinder."
885,885,5,Mark,False,9,"No, I'm going out to the pub with Jeff."
886,886,5,Mark,False,5,This is a special mission.
887,887,5,Mark,False,18,"Oh, Jez! Don't do that! Honestly, I won't be long. Then we can have a talk about stuff."
888,888,5,Mark,False,4,What sort of things?
889,889,5,Mark,False,30,"I'll be as quick as I can and if you do do that thing, don't do it in here 'cause the hook's practically out of the door as it is."
890,890,5,Mark,False,14,"Oh yeah, I play. I play all right. Misspent youth. You know the score."
891,891,5,Mark,False,42,"Plus, I thought it would be good to hang out a bit. 'Cause basically, you know, you're a bloke, I'm a bloke. We're both bloody good blokes. Unlike that idiotic Turkish shepherd who chewed off his own knackers. Did you see that?"
892,892,5,Mark,False,9,Bloody shithead. Yes! Mark the Shark is in business!
893,893,5,Mark,False,67,"Oh, yes, right. You play that, do you? Of course. So, FHM have only gone and done a bloody sex issue. Did you see that? Loads of birds, foil bag, the whole caboodle. Carmen Electra's in there. I would seriously love to really, really bang her. Although, if it was a choice between that and a drive in a Ferrari Testarossa, phew! Too close to call, yeah?"
894,894,5,Mark,False,1,Pardon?
895,895,5,Mark,False,16,"Yes, I heard what you said. Well, let's be honest. I suppose the best man won."
896,896,5,Mark,False,5,"This is fun, isn't it?"
897,897,5,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Jez."
898,898,5,Mark,False,3,"Actually, that's Jeff's."
899,899,5,Mark,False,37,"He's in the bog. But, the thing is, it's currently going a bit terribly, but it's really important that I make friends with him. So, I thought, you're more of a fun sort of guy than me."
900,900,5,Mark,False,26,"No, it's not like that. Look, if I don't make friends with Jeff, there's a very good chance I'll never speak to Sophie probably ever again."
901,901,5,Mark,False,6,Oh! Hi Jeff! You remember Jeremy.
902,902,5,Mark,False,18,"So, what now? Round of Sambucas and hit a club or just head back to ours, or... Sophie's?"
903,903,5,Mark,True,15,"Bonding with Jeff. I'm almost there, Soph. Clear the runway! I'm coming in to land!"
904,904,5,Mark,False,2,"Right, sorry."
905,905,5,Mark,True,28,I think I've got a pretty good hand. But there's always a chance someone else might have a better one. There's just no way of knowing for sure.
906,906,5,Mark,False,2,I fold.
907,907,5,Mark,False,2,"Er, maybe."
908,908,5,Mark,False,22,What a night! Looks like we're gonna be a great bunch of mates! We could all pile back to yours and Sophie's?
909,909,5,Mark,False,7,Or stay here and play something else!
910,910,5,Mark,True,32,"It's a relief, really. Tell me about your memories, dreams, and reflections, Jeff. Oh, what a surprise. You haven't got any because you're a gristle-head. Time to cut out the middle man."
911,911,5,Mark,False,2,"Hey, Soph."
912,912,5,Mark,False,23,"You know, I was just talking to Alan about Rod from Shapeero Finance. Don't you think we should really do something for him?"
913,913,5,Mark,False,36,"Yeah, for diabetes. Give something back to a top JLB client and give a nasty, un-glamorous illness a kick in the pants at the same time. I said I'd talk to you about a sponsored something."
914,914,5,Mark,False,23,"It's fine if you don't want to. I mean, it is for charity, but I could just tell Alan you're not into it."
915,915,5,Mark,False,20,"Could do. Although, if we do something together, it's more likely to capture people's imagination, yeah? I was thinking maybe…"
916,916,5,Mark,True,5,"maximum physical contact, potential horseplay"
917,917,5,Mark,False,1,swimming?
918,918,5,Mark,False,4,"Let's brainstorm later. Sorry, Soph."
919,919,5,Mark,False,24,"Jeremy, what, you can't just pop in 'cause you're bored. I'll be home in an hour. Why don't you kill some time at Caesar's World?"
920,920,5,Mark,False,15,"Oh, right. Sorry, mate. I appreciate what you're doing, but the Jeff project's been abandoned."
921,921,5,Mark,False,7,You're going out with him for fun?
922,922,5,Mark,True,17,Sponsored bungee. Three days to organise. A lifetime to look back on from our cottage in Dorset.
923,923,5,Mark,False,7,Alan's gonna be so pleased with us.
924,924,5,Mark,False,9,"Oh, yeah, yeah. And sorry about the big panic."
925,925,5,Mark,True,11,"So glad she bought it. Ooh, I'm so scared! Ha ha."
926,926,5,Mark,False,8,I feel much better doing a tandem jump.
927,927,5,Mark,True,69,"God, this is great! I think I actually prefer this to sex! No responsibility. I'm strapped on! If I get a bonk on, I'll say it's a buckle. Probably be too much to think about anyway. What with the falling towards the ground with only a massive rubber band between me and- what the fuck am I doing?! All my normal, sensible cowardice has got overridden by stupid love!"
928,928,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, God!"
929,929,5,Mark,False,5,"Yes, no, I don't know."
930,930,5,Mark,False,16,"I think I'm actually very hungry. How about, shall we not jump and just have lunch?"
931,931,5,Mark,False,9,"I'm genuinely really, really hungry. Too hungry to jump!"
932,932,5,Mark,False,9,"No, I don't wanna go. I need a sandwich."
933,933,5,Mark,False,4,Stop calling me Humpty!
934,934,5,Mark,False,13,"No! No! No! I'm hungry, all right?! I'm too bloody hungry to jump!"
935,935,5,Mark,False,21,I'm too bloody hungry to jump! I'm starving! It's not fair! It's not fair! You can't make a hungry man jump!
936,936,5,Mark,False,9,No! Do not just undo that. I am hungry!
937,937,5,Mark,False,7,Thanks so much. All makes a difference.
938,938,5,Mark,False,4,Why not? Who loses?
939,939,5,Mark,False,20,"Wake up, Soph. You think no one mimed at Live Aid? The ends always justify the means! That's been proven."
940,940,5,Mark,False,22,"Look, it was a hell of a long way down. A lot of people would be scared to even go up there."
941,941,5,Mark,False,35,"Soph, there's no need to go sarcastic. Listen, I've got a plan. Trek the Andes. I've got a mate and he did it. Two weeks in Peru and we can totally stick it to arthritis."
942,942,5,Mark,True,21,I have entered the abyss. I have bought a house in the abyss. I'm getting my post forwarded to the abyss.
943,943,5,Mark,False,25,"Oh, Jez. Don't worry about this. I'm not actually cutting myself. I just need to convince Sophie I'm desperate and obviously, I need some evidence."
944,944,5,Mark,False,11,"I told you, I'm not actually cutting myself. It's for evidence."
945,945,5,Mark,False,19,Self harm might be very appealing. She'll want to take care of me. I just wanna finish the S.
946,946,5,Mark,False,16,"Brilliant! A poem. Get a cup, we'll catch the blood, and I'll write her a poem."
947,947,5,Mark,True,39,"OK, come on. You can do this. Oh, shit! There he is. Am I actually gonna do this? I've done self harm. Compared to that, this is a walk in the park. Come on, man! Do it for Sophie."
948,948,5,Mark,False,4,"How's it going, Jeff?"
949,949,5,Mark,False,20,"Oh, not bad. Hey, look at that. Mike's arse. What a nice arse he's got on him there, wouldn't you say?"
950,950,5,Mark,False,9,I for one certainly wouldn't mind... giving him one.
951,951,5,Mark,False,21,"Yes, well, there's no need to spread it around. But yes, those are the facts. Sexuality is a broad spectrum and-"
952,952,5,Mark,False,12,"Yeah, that's right. I have gone somewhat, in fact almost entirely, gay."
953,953,5,Mark,False,26,"Yeah, well, now I've gone gay and everything. Do you think it would be all right if I came over to see Sophie now and again?"
954,954,5,Mark,False,8,"What? But, she said- she said you'd said-"
955,955,5,Mark,False,9,"Well, that's great. That's great, Jeff. Thanks a lot."
956,956,5,Mark,False,5,"Thanks. See you later, Jeff!"
957,957,5,Mark,True,29,"I am experiencing humiliation. Blood boiling, anger rising up, ready to explode. Then, falling back in on myself in the familiar shower of self-loathing. Mmmmmm warm copies make everything better."
958,958,5,Mark,False,3,"It's fine, Jeremy."
959,959,5,Mark,False,11,"Hi, Jeff. Just thought I might pop over since that's cool."
960,960,5,Mark,False,21,"Hey, Soph. I was thinking maybe we could cook these guys up something while they're in the pub? I've got wine!"
961,961,5,Mark,False,14,"It's Ernest and Julio. Fictional obviously, but it gives a nice image, doesn't it?"
962,962,5,Mark,False,29,"Four and a half solid entertainment hours! Soph, I was talking to Jeff the other day and it seems he doesn't actually mind me being round here at all."
963,963,5,Mark,False,5,"Right. It's just, you said-"
964,964,5,Mark,False,4,Right. Because of feelings?
965,965,5,Mark,False,1,Right.
966,966,5,Mark,True,14,"Got my emotional meat hook in. Now, time to waggle it around a bit."
967,967,5,Mark,False,27,"I suppose I was kind of surprised Jeff was cool about me coming over here. I mean, you and I, we do have a bit of history."
968,968,5,Mark,False,7,"Yeah, although, new volumes keep being published."
969,969,5,Mark,True,5,That's not a saucy metaphor!
970,970,5,Mark,False,9,"I mean, I might try some of my moves."
971,971,5,Mark,True,7,"Oh, my moves are nothing, are they?"
972,972,5,Mark,False,17,"You know, you ought to be careful wearing tops like that. I am a man, after all."
973,973,5,Mark,False,5,"Yes, they're in a submarine."
974,974,5,Mark,False,3,"No, not really."
975,975,5,Mark,False,3,Sure. No problem.
976,976,5,Mark,True,47,"You're a bottler, Corrigan. You couldn't bungee. You wouldn't lunge. Maybe I'm too nice. I should have tried ""hey baby, suck this!"" No, it's not my style. Got to stick to my own unique methods. My homespun charm. Also, I'd never be able to carry it off."
977,977,5,Mark,False,1,Jeff?
978,978,5,Mark,False,10,"You want me to- no, I don't think so, Jeff."
979,979,5,Mark,False,17,"Why would I have a problem, Jeff? I'm just a mate round seeing a couple of mates."
980,980,5,Mark,True,109,"This is it. This is my lowest ever. Wish I told him to fuck off. Except then, I'd never be allowed back. OK, right. Fetherlite. Don't want him to enjoy it any more than is strictly necessary. Ultra Strong. Yeah, he won't feel a thing. But then, maybe he'll last longer and- oh Jesus! This is a minefield! Serve him right if I prick them all with pins and then... Sophie got pregnant, and therefore, he ended up getting married? Got to think through these plans more! I'll just go for these. Coloured. Least that'll make him look faintly ridiculous. Heh, I win! In the most minor way possible."
981,981,5,Mark,False,20,"You were going to twat a geezer? What, were you playing the Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels video game?"
982,982,5,Mark,False,11,"What, did Jeff fart in a pint or something equally disgusting?"
983,983,5,Mark,False,7,"Oh, go on! You can tell me."
984,984,5,Mark,False,6,I promise on my mum's life.
985,985,5,Mark,False,23,He- Oh my God! I've hit the mother lode! This is what I've been waiting for! I can really fuck him with this!
986,986,5,Mark,False,12,"Hitler promised not to invade Czechoslovakia, Jeremy. Welcome to the real world."
987,987,5,Mark,False,15,What about it? What does that even mean? What are you gonna do? Kill her?
988,988,5,Mark,False,12,"Oh, right. So, who's your real best mate, Jeremy? Me or Jeff?"
989,989,5,Mark,True,8,"Brilliant! This is brilliant! Oh, life is sweet!"
990,990,5,Mark,False,3,"Hi there, Soph."
991,991,5,Mark,False,24,"Soph, listen. I've been turning this over and over in my head like a bloody horrible pancake. I just don't know what to do."
992,992,5,Mark,False,19,"There's something I need to tell you. Something I think I should tell. But, it's just so damn hard."
993,993,5,Mark,False,31,That's the thing though. That's what this horrible decision that I have to make relates to. Something about Jeff. Something he's done that I'm not sure if I should tell you.
994,994,5,Mark,False,15,"Oh, no. Now, I've said too much, haven't I? Damn! Damn these lips of mine."
995,995,5,Mark,False,39,"Look, it's not for me to tell tales on a mate, but just ask him, all right, what happened in the pub, by the fruit machine with the woman, and the lips. I can't say anything else! I won't!"
996,996,5,Mark,True,11,I hope I wasn't too subtle. That definitely wasn't too subtle.
997,997,5,Mark,False,6,"So, has Jeff said anything about-"
998,998,5,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
999,999,5,Mark,False,6,"Of course! Soph, are you OK?"
1000,1000,5,Mark,False,15,"There, there, Soph. It's fine! It's OK. Come through. Come through with good old Mark."
1001,1001,5,Mark,True,6,Her breast is just brushing my side there.
1002,1002,5,Mark,False,10,It's OK. I'll make us a nice cup of tea.
1003,1003,5,Mark,False,6,"Does... does he beat you, Soph?"
1004,1004,5,Mark,False,9,"Does he come at you with a stick, Soph?"
1005,1005,5,Mark,False,14,"He does beat you, though, mentally. And with his hands and with his fists."
1006,1006,5,Mark,False,6,"God, your head! Is it OK?"
1007,1007,5,Mark,False,5,What... why did you cough?
1008,1008,5,Mark,False,3,"No, you haven't."
1009,1009,5,Mark,False,6,Bollocks! You gave him a signal!
1010,1010,5,Mark,False,11,"Yeah, well, actually, I'm trying to have a conversation here, actually."
1011,1011,5,Mark,False,17,"Soph, sounds like your relationship was a prison with one innocent prisoner, you, and one guard, Jeff."
1012,1012,5,Mark,False,5,Right. That must be horrible.
1013,1013,5,Mark,False,7,"Oh, how coincidental, Jeremy! How very coincidental!"
1014,1014,5,Mark,False,9,"You're not wanted here, Jeff! Get away from here!"
1015,1015,5,Mark,False,13,"Get away from the door, Jeff, or I will give you the broom!"
1016,1016,5,Mark,False,11,"I'm gonna give you the broom, Jeff! I'm gonna broom you!"
1017,1017,5,Mark,False,8,"Don't worry, Soph! I'm giving him the broom!"
1018,1018,5,Mark,False,22,"No, we all hate you, Jeff! You're a cocksucker! Jez told me about your fling! Your friendship's bullshit and you're a fuckhead!"
1019,1019,5,Mark,False,16,"Ha ha ha ha! You lose, Jeff! You lose! How dangerous am I now, eh?! Huh?!"
1020,1020,5,Mark,False,17,"Sophie, you- you don't need to do this. There are places you can go to! Women's refuges!"
1021,1021,6,Mark,False,28,"Hey, I'm home. I've got Gladiator on DVD. Apparently there's an outtake where this extra gets piked and you can see all the- Jez, you're cleaning the bathroom."
1022,1022,6,Mark,True,5,Why? Sex slavery? Murder clear-up?
1023,1023,6,Mark,False,2,She is?
1024,1024,6,Mark,False,3,You're getting married?
1025,1025,6,Mark,False,1,Why?
1026,1026,6,Mark,False,10,"Don't you think... Nancy, isn't she... using you... a bit?"
1027,1027,6,Mark,False,12,"Yeah, well, sure, if that's the way you feel, maybe you should."
1028,1028,6,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy, I'm totally and completely over Sophie."
1029,1029,6,Mark,False,8,"So, Super Hans, what've you been up to?"
1030,1030,6,Mark,False,8,"Oh right, bit of soul searching, was it?"
1031,1031,6,Mark,False,10,"So listen, I wanted to have a chat about Nancy."
1032,1032,6,Mark,False,6,So you agree it's a terrible-
1033,1033,6,Mark,False,2,"Er, Jakarta."
1034,1034,6,Mark,False,18,So I thought we could split them up. Maybe you could tell him you got off with her.
1035,1035,6,Mark,False,5,It's an element of speech.
1036,1036,6,Mark,False,3,In a word.
1037,1037,6,Mark,False,6,"He'd never believe it, whereas you..."
1038,1038,6,Mark,False,2,Urban myth.
1039,1039,6,Mark,False,6,Of course I'll back you up.
1040,1040,6,Mark,False,2,A mongoose.
1041,1041,6,Mark,False,4,He was a mongoose.
1042,1042,6,Mark,False,4,"Mongoose! See, told you."
1043,1043,6,Mark,False,16,I can't believe you wanted to meet for lunch! You really meant it about being friends?
1044,1044,6,Mark,False,22,"Fine, fine. The human being's basic needs are really very simple. Food, liquid, entertainment and the release of fluids at regular intervals."
1045,1045,6,Mark,False,15,'Love life' may be a rather grandiose term for staring at women on the bus.
1046,1046,6,Mark,False,3,"Sophie, be quiet!"
1047,1047,6,Mark,False,5,I don't necessarily like her.
1048,1048,6,Mark,False,13,"You do realise it's me you're talking to yeah, not an Italian builder?"
1049,1049,6,Mark,False,6,"Sophie, no! No, Sophie, no, don't!"
1050,1050,6,Mark,True,29,"Oh, God, this is terrible. Maybe it'll go really well and I'll have a double wedding with Jeremy on Friday. Oh, no, she's coming. Must think words, funny words."
1051,1051,6,Mark,False,48,"Hi, hi. Say, isn't it funny, all the coffee? What's with all the coffee? Listen I'm just gonna go over to my stupid friend and grrr, give her a good shake. But if you ever want to call me about anything, then I'm in the book. Mark Corrigan."
1052,1052,6,Mark,True,14,"Too formal, lighten things up. Light, not slimy! Oh, can't retract the wink. Unless…"
1053,1053,6,Mark,False,2,See you.
1054,1054,6,Mark,True,7,"Brilliant, the twitching freak. Works every time."
1055,1055,6,Mark,False,11,"Hans, is it perhaps time we had a word with Jeremy?"
1056,1056,6,Mark,False,8,"When are you gonna say something, Super Hans?"
1057,1057,6,Mark,False,8,"Come on, you said it. She's Yoko remember?"
1058,1058,6,Mark,False,14,Yup. I wouldn't have believed it but I saw the whole darn shooting match.
1059,1059,6,Mark,False,3,"'Fraid so, definitely."
1060,1060,6,Mark,False,8,"Jez, mate, cheer up, you'll get over her."
1061,1061,6,Mark,False,15,"You'll have forgotten her in a week. You know what you're like, you big idiot."
1062,1062,6,Mark,False,1,Jez?
1063,1063,6,Mark,False,4,It was... a joke.
1064,1064,6,Mark,False,14,"Yeah, we, we were joking. She didn't suck his widdle. It was a put-on."
1065,1065,6,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, brilliant."
1066,1066,6,Mark,True,26,"There he goes, dead man walking. I tried, I failed. Got to let him make his own mistakes, like Dad did with me in the strimmer."
1067,1067,6,Mark,False,1,Yeah.
1068,1068,6,Mark,True,16,"Where's Sophie? She said she'd be here. Don't get hung up, Mark. It's over, case closed."
1069,1069,6,Mark,False,4,"Jez, you all right?"
1070,1070,6,Mark,False,4,It didn't relax him?
1071,1071,6,Mark,False,7,"Calm down Jez, it's gonna be OK."
1072,1072,6,Mark,False,23,"Listen, it's your special day, and even if I have to die of anxiety making an off-the-cuff speech, we're gonna keep it special."
1073,1073,6,Mark,False,93,"So, ladies and gentlemen. You'll forgive me, I haven't prepared a proper speech, but then perhaps that's appropriate, since this isn't a proper wedding. Or so the cynics may say. But I say to those cynics, listen, cynics, this is the modern world, and just because it's new and strange and unnerving doesn't mean it's not brilliant. In Ancient Rome, they had Cupid. In modern days, it's the Home Office. Love is blind. That's not a joke about David Blunkett. No, seriously, I would never make that joke. So I say to Jeremy and..."
1074,1074,6,Mark,False,2,where's Nancy?
1075,1075,6,Mark,False,2,"Oh, OK."
1076,1076,6,Mark,False,43,"I say to Nancy ""good luck with the interview"" and I say to Jeremy ""good luck with the marriage."" And I think the rest of us can unite in all saying, two fingers to the cynics and raising our glasses to true love!"
1077,1077,6,Mark,False,6,"Hey, Karen, pretty good, and you?"
1078,1078,6,Mark,False,29,"It was good to see you in Gino's. Got over the twitch, by the way. Next time I have acupuncture I'll get someone else to do it for me."
1079,1079,6,Mark,True,7,"Hey look at me go, I'm charming!"
1080,1080,6,Mark,False,25,"Yeah so, sorry if I was acting a bit weird. I guess I just wanted to see if you might want to hang out sometime."
1081,1081,6,Mark,True,12,I'm a natural! Maybe I should try it on someone better looking.
1082,1082,6,Mark,False,1,Sophie!
1083,1083,6,Mark,False,4,Are you all right?
1084,1084,6,Mark,False,7,"Oh, Soph, I'm so sorry, that's terrible."
1085,1085,6,Mark,True,3,That wasn't convincing.
1086,1086,6,Mark,False,3,Bollocks to love!
1087,1087,6,Mark,True,10,"Oh, God, I love you, I love you so much."
1088,1088,6,Mark,False,9,"But, I mean, why don't you come too, Soph?"
1089,1089,6,Mark,False,10,"No, no, obviously, come along with... Sam! This is Sam."
1090,1090,6,Mark,False,11,You two have loads in common. Sam's a lovely single Buddhist.
1091,1091,6,Mark,True,27,"Brilliant. The woman you love has only been single for a few minutes but already you've found her a nice, new boyfriend. Nice work, Mr. Fucking Stupid."
1092,1092,6,Mark,False,2,"Sure, whatever."
1093,1093,6,Mark,False,3,She definitely was.
1094,1094,6,Mark,True,27,"Sophie's eating up his whole Buddhist shtick. Got to stick it out. Keep being charming to Sophie, stay cold and unfriendly to Karen, without breaking social convention."
1095,1095,6,Mark,True,15,"Oh, Jesus, don't kill me, I'm not her date. Kill him. Actually, that'd be perfect."
1096,1096,6,Mark,True,15,"Yeah, right, don't mind the maniac! How are we supposed to not mind the maniac?"
1097,1097,6,Mark,False,22,"So, er, old question, but John or Paul, who was the best? I mean, Paul, obviously, but for the sake of argument."
1098,1098,6,Mark,True,34,"Shit, this is just not normal. Someone's gotta do something. He's gonna just stand there, doing nothing, like Jeff's the invading Chinese army, they're women, that old get-out. Oh, God, it's gotta be me."
1099,1099,6,Mark,False,12,"Listen, Jeff, I, er, I think, you know, it's time you left."
1100,1100,6,Mark,False,5,What am I gonna do?
1101,1101,6,Mark,True,3,What am I gonna do?
1102,1102,6,Mark,False,19,"Nothing, except stand here like a civilised man and wait for you to do the civilised thing and leave."
1103,1103,6,Mark,True,22,"Brilliant. Probably looks like I was ready to punch him, when actually I was gonna use the Buddhist as a human shield."
1104,1104,6,Mark,False,2,I know.
1105,1105,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, she's nice."
1106,1106,6,Mark,False,5,Really nice. She just isn't...
1107,1107,6,Mark,False,1,You.
1108,1108,6,Mark,True,17,"Public humiliation. Welcome to my world, Jeff. Although personally I wouldn't've picked that dress to cry on"
1109,1109,6,Mark,False,4,"Hey, Jez, hey, Nance."
1110,1110,6,Mark,False,14,"Oh, pretty darn well! Nearly, really, really nearly, finally got it together with Soph."
1111,1111,6,Mark,False,45,"Oh, yes! Now it's coming together, my friend. Look at you with your beautiful American wife and me with my lovely maybe girlfriend. Tell you what, we should get a couple of tandems and go to the Pyrenees and pick grapes or some crazy thing."
1112,1112,6,Mark,False,3,"Er, OK, later."
1113,1113,6,Mark,False,6,Metallica? Milk? Is everything all right?
1114,1114,6,Mark,False,1,Why?
1115,1115,6,Mark,False,6,A husk? That doesn't sound good.
1116,1116,6,Mark,False,1,Honestly?
1117,1117,6,Mark,False,3,"Then, yeah, absolutely."
