0,0,1,Jeremy,False,6,But what's Blair going to do?
1,1,1,Jeremy,False,14,"Ha. Or a super group? Blair on guitar, Bono on vocals, Clinton on sax?"
2,2,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, man."
3,3,1,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, my God. You're wearing- why are you wearing that?"
4,4,1,Jeremy,False,17,"It's not funny, Mark. It's not funny at all. Take it off, take it off right now."
5,5,1,Jeremy,False,13,Just take it off. We'll talk about why after you've taken it off.
6,6,1,Jeremy,False,6,"No, not that. Just, we're clashing!"
7,7,1,Jeremy,False,13,"It's exactly the fucking same as clashing, all right? Just take it off."
8,8,1,Jeremy,False,18,"All right, fine. If you're taking this down to the wire, fine. I blink, you win, OK? Jesus."
9,9,1,Jeremy,False,24,"Look, it was really nice of Sophie inviting me but I've actually got loads of really important stuff I need to do this weekend."
10,10,1,Jeremy,False,8,But what about your doubts? Your crippling doubts?
11,11,1,Jeremy,False,28,Or are you just gonna bury your doubts until they erupt as a massive stroke and I have to carry you around on my back for thirty years?
12,12,1,Jeremy,False,12,"Pretty good, seven out of ten. Just keep hitting those key features."
13,13,1,Jeremy,True,21,Poor bastard. The women are gonna make marriage mincemeat out of him. He's like a wedding burger and they're the buns.
14,14,1,Jeremy,False,2,I'm sorry?
15,15,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, right, that. Shit."
16,16,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Uh, no."
17,17,1,Jeremy,False,5,"OK, that's an interesting story."
18,18,1,Jeremy,True,31,"Great, I'm sitting at the children's table. I'm with the kids. I'm not part of the family at all, I'm the rubber toy brought along for the weirdo to chew on."
19,19,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Mm-hmm, Jamie, where's your gun?"
20,20,1,Jeremy,True,21,"No, of course he's not allowed 'cause he's Mark Chapman in the making and I'm very much a 21st century Lennon."
21,21,1,Jeremy,False,15,"So, I'm Jamie's bum boy, is that it? I'm the fluffer. I'm going home, Mark."
22,22,1,Jeremy,False,11,And what if I don't? Are you going to shoot me?
23,23,1,Jeremy,False,13,"If you shoot me, I'll shoot you straight back. You do realise that?"
24,24,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Congratulations, you've killed a sentient being."
25,25,1,Jeremy,False,14,"No teas for the beast-master, thanks. He feasts on the blood of his prey."
26,26,1,Jeremy,False,1,Hello.
27,27,1,Jeremy,True,16,"Oh, alone with the mum. Just act normal. She doesn't know I'm not wearing any pants."
28,28,1,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, right, yeah. I mean, we only watched the Lion King and his Fatboy Slim DVD."
29,29,1,Jeremy,False,1,Wow.
30,30,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Right, well, brilliant."
31,31,1,Jeremy,True,16,"One Jezmobile. No strings attached. I mean, obviously loads of strings but just ignore the strings."
32,32,1,Jeremy,False,5,"So, whatcha making, Mrs. C?"
33,33,1,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, right, Blair, yeah. I see, nice."
34,34,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Cool, very cool."
35,35,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Um, yep."
36,36,1,Jeremy,False,7,Yeah. It's good to have a friend.
37,37,1,Jeremy,True,8,Suck Mummy's finger. Do I suck the finger?
38,38,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Mmm, very good. I mean, I've got a girlfriend."
39,39,1,Jeremy,True,21,"OK, I'm finger sucking. Is this wrong? Maybe this is totally normal. Maybe this is what they do in the country."
40,40,1,Jeremy,False,1,Good.
41,41,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Yes, I do like it."
42,42,1,Jeremy,True,20,"Maybe she just likes having her finger sucked. I mean, I don't mind, but eventually it's going to get cloying."
43,43,1,Jeremy,False,4,"No, yeah, I'm sure."
44,44,1,Jeremy,False,1,Indeed.
45,45,1,Jeremy,False,3,"Technically, mm-hmm, yes."
46,46,1,Jeremy,True,29,"OK, it's not gonna be just the jam. So what am I gonna do? It's almost like a moral decision, but not really, 'cause no one will find out."
47,47,1,Jeremy,False,12,So how did it go down the pub? Make a good impression?
48,48,1,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah?
49,49,1,Jeremy,False,5,"Wow. That's... I'm impressed, Mark."
50,50,1,Jeremy,True,12,Could go for a high five. Probably not the most appropriate time.
51,51,1,Jeremy,False,6,"So, is that why, the beard?"
52,52,1,Jeremy,False,6,I thought you liked the beard.
53,53,1,Jeremy,False,8,"So, when are you gonna call it off?"
54,54,1,Jeremy,False,1,Yeah.
55,55,1,Jeremy,False,13,Right. So where are you planning to find this magical musical break-up hospital?
56,56,1,Jeremy,False,7,Why don't you just finish it now?
57,57,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?
58,58,1,Jeremy,False,1,What?
59,59,1,Jeremy,False,5,Nothing is going on there.
60,60,1,Jeremy,False,19,"Yeah. Actually, I did want to tell someone. I mean, it was so cool. She had all this jam-"
61,61,1,Jeremy,False,2,She's hot.
62,62,1,Jeremy,False,11,"I don't know, I think I made a pretty good impression."
63,63,1,Jeremy,True,4,I am James Bond.
64,64,1,Jeremy,False,10,"So come on, Mark, why haven't you told her yet?"
65,65,1,Jeremy,False,3,He can't hear.
66,66,1,Jeremy,False,11,"Can you, you big fox-hunting, badger-baiting tweed-shirt bumfuck homophobe? Oh, shit."
67,67,1,Jeremy,False,8,"So come on, are you having second thoughts?"
68,68,1,Jeremy,False,6,"So, I like your barn, Ian."
69,69,1,Jeremy,True,1,Shit!
70,70,1,Jeremy,False,21,"You know what, I'd probably just leave it. Let it slide. So, what's the best bit of metal you've ever detected?"
71,71,1,Jeremy,True,22,"Oh my God, that's why he brought us out here. He's gonna kill me. Can you kill someone with a metal detector?"
72,72,1,Jeremy,True,7,"Oh, thank you, Dan, whoever you are."
73,73,1,Jeremy,False,4,Dan. What a filthy-
74,74,1,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, let's get Dan. Punish Dan."
75,75,1,Jeremy,False,22,What was all that about? Trying to get him to poke me in the eye? Let him poke Dan in the eye.
76,76,1,Jeremy,False,32,"Look, stop moaning. We're out with a man who owns guns. You're chucking his daughter, and I've screwed his wife. Tonight is going, if a bit weird, extremely fucking well for us."
77,77,1,Jeremy,False,9,"Exactly. I nick your milk, you burn my barn."
78,78,1,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, take that, barny."
79,79,1,Jeremy,True,8,"I'm a motherfucker, that's literally what I am."
80,80,1,Jeremy,False,2,"Mmm-hmm, great."
81,81,1,Jeremy,False,20,"Oh, cool. It's got a Pret, it's got a Virgin Express, it's got a Gap and a massive Cafe Nero."
82,82,1,Jeremy,True,13,He thinks I'm his way into the music biz. Forget it. Music's full.
83,83,1,Jeremy,False,1,Mmm-hmm.
84,84,1,Jeremy,False,4,I like the lyrics.
85,85,1,Jeremy,False,17,"Well, I did see him throw a petrol bomb, but I thought that might be a joke."
86,86,1,Jeremy,False,2,"OK, thanks."
87,87,1,Jeremy,True,28,"Yeah, right. So your husband can kill me and your son can worship my stuffed corpse and you can wheel me out for a fuck. No, thank you!"
88,88,1,Jeremy,False,5,I am fucking flooring it!
89,89,2,Jeremy,False,3,How's it going?
90,90,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Big Suze was hungry. She's rich, Mark, she doesn't understand about not taking other people's stuff."
91,91,2,Jeremy,False,1,Johnson.
92,92,2,Jeremy,True,18,"Oh, I've got a sweater round my shoulders. I'm not a corporate cocksucker, I'm a human being. Sure."
93,93,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Er, no."
94,94,2,Jeremy,False,3,"What, Big Suze?"
95,95,2,Jeremy,False,1,What?
96,96,2,Jeremy,False,3,An indecent proposal?
97,97,2,Jeremy,False,10,Five hundred and thirty pounds? To sleep with Big Suze?
98,98,2,Jeremy,False,6,It certainly is an indecent proposal!
99,99,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Well, it is a bit different, 'cause you'd be putting your dick right-"
100,100,2,Jeremy,False,8,Maybe you could finger her for three hundred?
101,101,2,Jeremy,True,32,"He obviously thinks I'm some sort of scag addict bedroom DJ who can be bought off, but no one's gonna give me a medal for saying no, I am pretty broke, and..."
102,102,2,Jeremy,False,4,"OK, it's a deal."
103,103,2,Jeremy,True,24,"Is this a terrible idea? It can't be, it's in a film. They wouldn't put a terrible idea in a film, they'd get sued."
104,104,2,Jeremy,True,7,Shit. This could be a tricky sell.
105,105,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Say, Suze, do you like the films of Robert Redford?"
106,106,2,Jeremy,False,12,"He's a red-haired old gentleman, and he started the Sundance Film Festival."
107,107,2,Jeremy,False,20,"Exactly. So in that spirit, I was wondering, basically, how would you feel about sleeping with Mark's boss? For money."
108,108,2,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, but it's not like that. It's from a Hollywood film."
109,109,2,Jeremy,False,10,"Pimp me out, Pimp My Ride, there's a new climate."
110,110,2,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, sure, from one perspective, but also, is it really so different from hiring a solicitor or leasing a villa in Spain?"
111,111,2,Jeremy,False,30,"No, look, Suze, no, sorry. I love you, I love you, I've just got this big overdraft, and uh, I take it all back, there. Normal, we're back to normal."
112,112,2,Jeremy,False,10,"It was a joke, Suze. I'm hitting the reset button."
113,113,2,Jeremy,False,2,Don't go!
114,114,2,Jeremy,True,19,"God, I only asked her to be a hooker. It's not like I wanted her to work in telesales."
115,115,2,Jeremy,True,22,"Here we go, Big Suze's place. If she won't take my calls, how about I hit her with some petrol station flowers?"
116,116,2,Jeremy,False,1,Johnson?!
117,117,2,Jeremy,False,5,What the hell are you-?
118,118,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Suze, what's he doing here?"
119,119,2,Jeremy,False,4,What do you mean?
120,120,2,Jeremy,True,6,He didn't even pay for her.
121,121,2,Jeremy,False,3,No I wouldn't!
122,122,2,Jeremy,False,32,"You can't treat me like this, Johnson! You owe me! I'll take this to the Citizens Advice Bureau, Yeah? How'd you like those guys on your ass? I don't give up, Alan!"
123,123,2,Jeremy,False,6,"Hey hey, it's me! Surprise visit!"
124,124,2,Jeremy,False,5,"I'm here to party, man!"
125,125,2,Jeremy,False,19,"No, no, God no. Maybe. Listen, I need to find Big Suze. There's no answer at her room, so..."
126,126,2,Jeremy,False,7,That was before we stopped going out.
127,127,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Exactly, duh. That's how love works, Mark."
128,128,2,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, Suze."
129,129,2,Jeremy,False,22,"Me, nothing. I was just passing through Kettering, and I thought, hey, I know someone who's gone to Kettering for the weekend."
130,130,2,Jeremy,False,30,"Honestly, I was always coming to Kettering. I like it here, it's a party town. Look, come on, Suze. I mean, let's sort this. What do you see in Johnson?"
131,131,2,Jeremy,False,7,Come on. Is it because he's black?
132,132,2,Jeremy,False,20,"Well, you're making a mistake, Suze, because he's terrible at being black. I'm a better black man than he is."
133,133,2,Jeremy,False,48,"Look, Suze, being black isn't about the colour of your skin. It's about vibe, about hanging out, kicking back, smoking a number, fighting prejudice and negative stereotypes wherever you find them, yeah? I'm down with all that. Is Johnson? I mean, what's Johnson done for black people lately?"
134,134,2,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, apart from that."
135,135,2,Jeremy,False,23,"I did not try to sell her body to another man. I tried to rent out her sexual organs, on a one-use basis."
136,136,2,Jeremy,False,10,So you didn't fancy a night out with the team?
137,137,2,Jeremy,False,6,Really? God. Men. Do you wanna...?
138,138,2,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh, go on. Before you get your booty locked up by Captain Corrigan."
139,139,2,Jeremy,True,32,She's so cool and nice. How did Mark even manage to get anything going with her? I guess she must have some massive character defect that only becomes apparent after a while.
140,140,2,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, pretty terrible. I mean, I came to try and win her back, but I don't even know if I like her, or..."
141,141,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Four? Oh, yeah."
142,142,2,Jeremy,True,16,"Jesus, I've had sex with more men than that and I basically only sleep with women."
143,143,2,Jeremy,False,16,"I mean, you might slip another one or two in just to get your average up."
144,144,2,Jeremy,False,9,"Oh, you're attractive. You're a hottie, Soph, you're hot."
145,145,2,Jeremy,False,5,"Well, here's to being hot."
146,146,2,Jeremy,True,56,"Shit, is this gonna happen? This is almost definitely a terrible idea. But I won't know for certain until I've actually done it. Nope, I was right, that was a terrible idea. That's probably the stupidest thing I've ever done in my life. Although, maybe actually screwing each other will kind of make it weirdly better."
147,147,2,Jeremy,False,16,"Cool, right, well. I'll probably head off. You know, get some sleep in the utility area."
148,148,2,Jeremy,False,32,"No, mate, no, no. No, I'm fine in the utility area. I've got it all set up, you know, a couple of bog rolls for a pillow, and a wicked big tarpaulin."
149,149,2,Jeremy,False,10,"You're a bloody good guy. God, you're a great guy."
150,150,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Isn't he a bloody good guy, Soph?"
151,151,2,Jeremy,True,26,"I feel so bad about betraying Mark. Still, another snog for Jez's snog book. Hmm, he looks terrible. Looks like he could do with a friend."
152,152,2,Jeremy,False,1,Mark?
153,153,2,Jeremy,True,10,"God, I really hope I don't still smell of Sophie."
154,154,2,Jeremy,False,7,"What's on the piece of paper, Mark?"
155,155,2,Jeremy,False,12,Is there something on that piece of paper that's made you sad?
156,156,2,Jeremy,False,12,Is it something to do with history? Have they stopped history books?
157,157,2,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, that's horrible, who sent you that?"
158,158,2,Jeremy,False,4,Let's have a look.
159,159,2,Jeremy,False,1,Shit.
160,160,2,Jeremy,False,5,Maybe you should run away.
161,161,2,Jeremy,False,30,"Well, I mean, people say it like it's a bad thing, you know, running away from your problems. But if your problems never catch up with you, what's the hitch?"
162,162,2,Jeremy,False,18,What do you care? You'd be in the woods playing the ukulele with the rabbits and the squirrels.
163,163,2,Jeremy,False,3,"Do it, man!"
164,164,2,Jeremy,True,39,"I think that was good advice. I mean, I didn't actually expect him to do it. Maybe I wouldn't have said it if I'd thought there was any chance of him actually doing it, but, yep, there he goes."
165,165,2,Jeremy,True,15,"Hiding out in a car park. He's not exactly Grizzly Adams, but it's a start."
166,166,2,Jeremy,False,22,"I know my rights. I've spoken to my friends at the Citizens Advice Bureau. Pay up, or I shall make a disturbance."
167,167,2,Jeremy,False,12,I'll take it. And you know what? This means nothing to me.
168,168,2,Jeremy,False,44,"I haven't got a penny in the world, Suze, but this means nothing to me without you. [Jeremy throws the cash out of the window] There, you see? Now do you see? That's how I feel. Now will you go back out with me?"
169,169,2,Jeremy,False,7,"In that case, if you'll excuse me."
170,170,3,Jeremy,False,19,Just doodles. It's a logo for when people are in touch about doing baseball caps with my initials on.
171,171,3,Jeremy,False,3,Who's Matt Townsend?
172,172,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Mark, are you having some kind of mental breakdown?"
173,173,3,Jeremy,False,25,"I don't need to pay money to join a gym. The world is my gym. The hills, the trees, the rivers, they are my gym."
174,174,3,Jeremy,False,17,It's her birthday. I'm going to pick the most savage ones and then post them to her.
175,175,3,Jeremy,False,27,"No, I have. This is how I've got over it. Right. Have you got any spare carrier bags? 'Cause I'm going out to collect some dog shit."
176,176,3,Jeremy,False,1,Mark?
177,177,3,Jeremy,False,24,"Oh, I got a bit drunk and posted that stuff to Big Suze, and then I sobered up and sort of had second thoughts."
178,178,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Oh, shit. Come on."
179,179,3,Jeremy,False,8,"What am I doing with my life, Mark?"
180,180,3,Jeremy,False,31,"I'm such a cock-ring. I drove Nancy away, Big Suze left me. I just wish something would work out for me, you know? Maybe my life's just on the wrong track."
181,181,3,Jeremy,False,16,I can't believe you saw her last night but waited till this morning to tell me.
182,182,3,Jeremy,False,6,She must be coming in soon.
183,183,3,Jeremy,False,1,Nancy!
184,184,3,Jeremy,False,14,This is so- wow! I didn't know you were even back in the country.
185,185,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Yeah, we should get together. You know, have a drink, reminisce?"
186,186,3,Jeremy,False,11,"Or the good times. You know, the Robin Williams DVD marathon."
187,187,3,Jeremy,False,14,"Or our wedding day. I mean, that was a happy memory. Remember that, wifey?"
188,188,3,Jeremy,False,21,"She's gone. Still, try again tomorrow, she'll probably feel a whole lot differently. So, can you give me another guest pass?"
189,189,3,Jeremy,False,2,It's important.
190,190,3,Jeremy,False,6,Who to? One of your friends?
191,191,3,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh come on, mate. How am I going to see Nancy again if you don't give me a pass? She clearly hates me."
192,192,3,Jeremy,False,12,I'm not giving up that easily. Faint heart never won fair maid.
193,193,3,Jeremy,True,28,"Perfect. Job at the gym. If me and Nancy are trapped together, she'll naturally start to fancy me. Just like the way people fuck each other in prison."
194,194,3,Jeremy,False,6,"That OK, I'm fine with that."
195,195,3,Jeremy,False,4,I like long hours.
196,196,3,Jeremy,False,6,"I like that, it sounds interesting."
197,197,3,Jeremy,False,5,I find that stuff interesting.
198,198,3,Jeremy,True,5,Don't want to seem overqualified.
199,199,3,Jeremy,False,3,What's a novel?
200,200,3,Jeremy,True,35,"Letting her go first, just as though she's the same as me, or even better. God, I'm amazing. I hope they get to go on the equipment free after hours, that'll be nice for them."
201,201,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Hi, Nancy."
202,202,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Yup, I work here now. Amazing coincidence, yeah?"
203,203,3,Jeremy,False,46,"Look, Nance, since we're gonna be work colleagues now, I think it's important that I clear the air about me cheating on you. That was a terrible, terrible thing to do and I am sorry. You know, I haven't even really had sex since you left."
204,204,3,Jeremy,False,14,"No, sure, maybe a bit of oral, but I could never really enjoy it."
205,205,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Exactly, we'll be friends, like the friends on Friends."
206,206,3,Jeremy,True,16,"Who were such good friends, they got bored of being friends and started screwing each other."
207,207,3,Jeremy,False,6,"So, what's new in your world?"
208,208,3,Jeremy,False,1,Great.
209,209,3,Jeremy,False,17,"Well that's what you should do, then. You should bone him. I'd like to watch. Only joking."
210,210,3,Jeremy,True,11,"Must remember, watching someone you love having sex isn't that fun."
211,211,3,Jeremy,False,1,No.
212,212,3,Jeremy,False,8,"Don't think so, she's not really my type."
213,213,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Poland isn't in the third world, Nance. They don't live in huts."
214,214,3,Jeremy,True,26,"Maybe I can use Eva as a decoy. ""Hey Nancy, I fancy your friend,"" then ""Oh shit, look, my lips have slipped and I'm kissing you."""
215,215,3,Jeremy,False,40,"You know, I'm the first white English person on the cleaning staff. I'm getting a whole new view of life, the other side of the potato. They have these sandwiches, but they don't come from shops, they make them themselves."
216,216,3,Jeremy,False,32,"It's like Titanic. You're upstairs in your starched collar, while I'm down below decks dancing a jig with the Poles and the Africans, having a better time than you could possibly imagine."
217,217,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Hey, Nancy!"
218,218,3,Jeremy,False,15,"So, I've been thinking about what we discussed, and I do actually, definitely, fancy Eva."
219,219,3,Jeremy,False,29,"Oh, Nancy, you know me, I don't really have a type. If it moves, I'll try and hump it. So tonight, why don't we all go to the cinema?"
220,220,3,Jeremy,True,1,Fuck.
221,221,3,Jeremy,False,27,"Yeah, but do you really wanna take the risk of asking him? There's a chance he might just laugh in your face and call you a slag."
222,222,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Great, OK! We'll set it up for the staff party on Thursday."
223,223,3,Jeremy,True,30,"Oh yeah, I'm awesome all right. I'm an awesome shit. I'm the cuckoo in the nest, the python in the toy box, and, quite possibly, the man of your dreams."
224,224,3,Jeremy,False,4,"It's Matt, isn't it?"
225,225,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Jeremy, yeah. I've got a message from Nancy on reception."
226,226,3,Jeremy,False,14,"Yeah, she says she's seen you looking at her and she thinks you're disgusting."
227,227,3,Jeremy,False,21,"Yeah, she says you stare at her like a sex offender. And, if you keep doing it, she'll call the police."
228,228,3,Jeremy,False,26,"I'll tell her. But she says if she sees you doing it again, she knows some bad dudes and they'll... do you even want to know?"
229,229,3,Jeremy,False,13,She says they'll rip your cock off and stuff it in your mouth.
230,230,3,Jeremy,False,8,Sorry to be the messenger. Don't shoot me!
231,231,3,Jeremy,False,7,"It's cool. I've got your back, dude."
232,232,3,Jeremy,True,12,And I've got your hairy plums in the palm of my hand.
233,233,3,Jeremy,True,22,"Staff party, Nancy, sauna, champagne. This is the kind of thing that should be happening to me on a daily fucking basis."
234,234,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, she went to chill out in the flotation tank."
235,235,3,Jeremy,False,27,"No, no. I made a joke about Lech Wałęsa and she took offence, then she started getting really snitty about UK hip-hop so things just fell apart."
236,236,3,Jeremy,True,5,Could use my sauna line.
237,237,3,Jeremy,False,7,"Cor, it's like a sauna in here!"
238,238,3,Jeremy,True,15,Classic line. That is just a great line. Got to manoeuvre more dates into saunas.
239,239,3,Jeremy,False,7,"So, how's it going? Enjoy the party?"
240,240,3,Jeremy,False,8,"As a matter of fact, I did, yeah."
241,241,3,Jeremy,False,5,I probably shouldn't tell you.
242,242,3,Jeremy,False,17,"He said he's not really into anything serious at the moment. He's looking for, quote-unquote, a fuck-monkey."
243,243,3,Jeremy,False,9,"Yeah, and not even the good kind of fuck-monkey."
244,244,3,Jeremy,False,39,"Men do and say horrible things. I know I have, but I'm lucky because I've been given another chance to be your friend. And I wouldn't trade a moment of that friendship for a lifetime of fuck-monkey jungle action."
245,245,3,Jeremy,False,2,What the-?
246,246,3,Jeremy,True,16,"The gooseberry's revenge! That hairy gooseberry, she couldn't just stay in her bloody punnet, could she?"
247,247,3,Jeremy,False,12,"I don't know, maybe some stoned weightlifter playing a prank or something?"
248,248,3,Jeremy,False,18,"Still, there are worse places to get trapped, right? I mean, you must be bloody relaxed by now."
249,249,3,Jeremy,False,15,"Er, the one affecting me, then I can have the one affecting you as dessert."
250,250,3,Jeremy,False,7,What?! What about all my fuck-monkey stuff?
251,251,3,Jeremy,False,10,"Oh, shit. That's disgusting. I'm depressed. What's your bad news?"
252,252,3,Jeremy,False,5,What's so bad about that?
253,253,3,Jeremy,False,1,Oh.
254,254,3,Jeremy,False,21,"But isn't it quite good if she does find out? I mean, you know, so you don't break both your hearts?"
255,255,3,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, yeah."
256,256,3,Jeremy,True,6,Like that's ever going to happen.
257,257,3,Jeremy,False,42,"Well, what am I going to do? Maybe I'll tell Nancy Matt's got AIDS. But then she'd say, ""Sorry,"" and he'd say, ""Why?"" And she'd say, ""Oh, I thought you had AIDS."" And he'd say, ""No."" And then they'd just start fucking."
258,258,3,Jeremy,False,1,Sorry.
259,259,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah, get rid of Matt. And fast, before Nancy asks him out."
260,260,3,Jeremy,False,11,Kill him? There's an incinerator round the back of the gym.
261,261,3,Jeremy,False,8,We could say he poos in the pool.
262,262,3,Jeremy,False,25,"He'd definitely get the sack for that. Plus, what kind of a freak would do that? It should screw his chances with Nancy for good."
263,263,3,Jeremy,False,19,"No, we just lie. Shame in a way, because I've always kind of wanted to poo in a pool."
264,264,3,Jeremy,False,7,"It'll be fine, just follow my lead."
265,265,3,Jeremy,True,7,"Not straighten out, sack the innocent man!"
266,266,3,Jeremy,False,5,There was that other thing.
267,267,3,Jeremy,False,12,"Yes, the other thing. Remember, what you told me? About your knob?"
268,268,3,Jeremy,False,12,You should have thought about that when you were touching his cock.
269,269,3,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, Nance, he's a pool poo-er. You know what that means? He poos in the pool."
270,270,3,Jeremy,False,6,"Oh, that's great, thanks a lot."
271,271,3,Jeremy,False,4,"Yeah, exactly. Fuck off."
272,272,3,Jeremy,False,9,"He really doesn't know us at all, does he?"
273,273,4,Jeremy,True,42,"Yeah, great night at the pub this is. Laura's caught in Super Hans's tractor beam. Kerry's being all lovely to Mike about his mum's thyroid thing. I've got no way out. Stuck with the newbie, Mr. Fucking Shirt. Got to say something."
274,274,4,Jeremy,False,6,So how do you know everyone?
275,275,4,Jeremy,False,1,Cool.
276,276,4,Jeremy,True,7,"Jesus, come on, throw me a bone."
277,277,4,Jeremy,False,9,So have you got any plans for the weekend?
278,278,4,Jeremy,False,2,Oh right.
279,279,4,Jeremy,False,32,"You're The Orgazoid? Oh my God, you're the- I thought you were just a man in a shirt sitting on a chair. Your first two CDs, I know every track. Borneo Function."
280,280,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Hans, this is- it's- it's not just a man. This is The Orgazoid."
281,281,4,Jeremy,False,5,Well why didn't you say?
282,282,4,Jeremy,False,6,Can I get you a drink?
283,283,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh right, I mean you've been as high as is possible to go."
284,284,4,Jeremy,False,10,And you've been as low as it's possible to get.
285,285,4,Jeremy,False,9,And what's it like when you're up that high?
286,286,4,Jeremy,False,9,And what's it like when you're down that low?
287,287,4,Jeremy,False,1,Wow.
288,288,4,Jeremy,False,4,Well that sounds amazing.
289,289,4,Jeremy,True,20,Orgazoid's handyman. This is a dream come true. Handyman to chauffeur to keyboard player. It's a very well-established career path.
290,290,4,Jeremy,False,13,"Oh man, my job is the nuts. I had a great first day."
291,291,4,Jeremy,False,31,"He's not a man, he's a band. He's one of the most brilliant techno pioneers of all time, and he's paying me five hundred quid a week, in advance, in cash."
292,292,4,Jeremy,False,20,It's not nothing. Making smoothies from a smoothie maker is not nothing. You should try cleaning one of those mothers.
293,293,4,Jeremy,False,33,Why does everything good have to be some horrible arrangement? Me and Russell are just two guys having a nice time. That's what life is supposed to be like in case you've forgotten.
294,294,4,Jeremy,False,2,Going out?
295,295,4,Jeremy,True,11,"What? He's not going out. He can't, he doesn't know how."
296,296,4,Jeremy,False,3,Where? Who with?
297,297,4,Jeremy,False,2,A nightclub?
298,298,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Mark, come on, what the hell's going on?"
299,299,4,Jeremy,False,6,They all hated you at Polefield.
300,300,4,Jeremy,False,2,The norms?
301,301,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Right, well this I have got to see. I could invite Nancy. Yeah, brilliant excuse to see her."
302,302,4,Jeremy,False,64,"Oh yeah, that's really gonna break his balls if I roll in an hour late. Mark, this is Russell Orgazoid. He's a creative, I'm a creative. We don't make steam engines out of pig iron in this country any more, yeah? We hang out, we fuck around on the PlayStation, we have some Ben and Jerry's. That's how everyone makes their money now, yeah?"
303,303,4,Jeremy,False,16,Hope Nancy gets here soon. This is gonna be perfect. She won't know anyone except me.
304,304,4,Jeremy,False,2,Hey Nancy.
305,305,4,Jeremy,True,7,She made some friends pretty fucking quick.
306,306,4,Jeremy,False,2,I'm sorry?
307,307,4,Jeremy,True,14,"Shit, this is just like school. Have to side with the powerful to survive."
308,308,4,Jeremy,False,5,Ha ha ha two hours!
309,309,4,Jeremy,True,28,"Oh yeah, making smoothies at The Orgazoid's house. This is the kind of job I deserve. I've paid my dues. All those years signing on every bloody week."
310,310,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, cheers, Russell. Yeah, maybe I will."
311,311,4,Jeremy,True,23,"Nothing dodgy about this. Just going for a swim in my trunks. I can't swim in a three-piece suit, so screw you, cynics."
312,312,4,Jeremy,False,3,Oh my God.
313,313,4,Jeremy,True,25,"Wow, Super Hans is gonna shit a brick when I show him this. Finally, something to beat that car battery he nicked off The Prodigy."
314,314,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Hi, honey, I'm home."
315,315,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, just a jumper Russell got for me."
316,316,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Nothing, Jesus. A squash racquet."
317,317,4,Jeremy,False,18,"He doesn't have anyone to play with. And two people can't share one bloody racquet. Case closed, Columbo."
318,318,4,Jeremy,False,11,The safari park? With that dickhead Foz? Have you gone mental?
319,319,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Oh, I get it. You're just another dirty dog like everyone else."
320,320,4,Jeremy,False,2,Your sheath?
321,321,4,Jeremy,False,17,"Fucking hell, what's going on? Are you trying to get your end away while Sophie's not here?"
322,322,4,Jeremy,False,18,"OK, if Sally was sitting here now, and she said, Mark, let's do it, what would you say?"
323,323,4,Jeremy,False,1,Yes.
324,324,4,Jeremy,False,16,You're disgusting. But I like it. It's like going to a strip joint with the Pope.
325,325,4,Jeremy,False,23,"Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it because of my job, but my boss was actually really cool about it."
326,326,4,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh yeah, what about this? Is that real enough for you?"
327,327,4,Jeremy,False,13,Well you're becoming a pain in the arse. How do you like that?
328,328,4,Jeremy,False,8,See how much money you earned this week.
329,329,4,Jeremy,False,12,"Not a lot in here, Mark, apart from a couple of moths."
330,330,4,Jeremy,False,2,"Oops, butterfingers."
331,331,4,Jeremy,False,6,You gonna go and get it?
332,332,4,Jeremy,False,8,Don't be a dick. Go and get it.
333,333,4,Jeremy,False,5,I'm not gonna get it.
334,334,4,Jeremy,False,24,"Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
335,335,4,Jeremy,True,18,"Wow, I'm getting big laughs off humiliating my best mate. How can something so wrong feel so right?"
336,336,4,Jeremy,False,20,"Well actually Russell had to go off to Norway this morning, so I'm just here. Is that all right, Dad?"
337,337,4,Jeremy,False,3,"Yes, I'm fine."
338,338,4,Jeremy,False,12,Is it OK if Nancy uses the computer to redo her CV?
339,339,4,Jeremy,False,5,"Your computer, the computer, whatever."
340,340,4,Jeremy,False,1,Why?
341,341,4,Jeremy,False,2,"No, why."
342,342,4,Jeremy,False,3,31 Bishop's Avenue.
343,343,4,Jeremy,False,15,"No, I don't particularly want to go to that place right now if I'm honest."
344,344,4,Jeremy,False,25,"No, you need me to do the alarms, and there's like six different alarms, but I'm just feeling a bit weird about the whole situation."
345,345,4,Jeremy,False,18,"Well, as it turns out, there were, there are certain additional duties which I was expected to perform."
346,346,4,Jeremy,False,6,"Well, you know, I'm his handyman."
347,347,4,Jeremy,False,11,"It's just, he did expect me to... give him a... hand."
348,348,4,Jeremy,False,4,I helped him out.
349,349,4,Jeremy,False,1,Yes.
350,350,4,Jeremy,False,43,"And now I don't know what to do. 'Cause on the one hand- one the one hand it's a really good job. But on the other, I don't really want to go back to that place or have anything to do with him."
351,351,4,Jeremy,False,29,"I got Super Hans to fill in yesterday. Said I was sick. There's loads needs doing before he comes back, but I just feel a bit dirty, you know."
352,352,4,Jeremy,False,20,"I don't think it is the same, Mark. I feel like my soul is being chipped away bit by bit."
353,353,4,Jeremy,False,18,"And you don't have to be a smackhead to wank off old geezers, but that probably helps too."
354,354,4,Jeremy,False,4,"Sorry, I didn't think."
355,355,4,Jeremy,False,4,Did you... do it?
356,356,4,Jeremy,False,5,No I haven't! It's not-
357,357,4,Jeremy,False,13,What do you mean that is so me? That is not so me.
358,358,4,Jeremy,True,28,"So I have to jerk him off, but at least I get a lift home. Never mind. Only a few hand shandies between me and a home studio."
359,359,4,Jeremy,False,2,Us? Yeah?
360,360,4,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, right, so can I stop doing it?"
361,361,4,Jeremy,False,22,It's just I don't really want to do it. Could I start wearing a mitten? Or maybe chuck a flannel over it?
362,362,4,Jeremy,False,30,"No, but the thing is I really like you too. I've been hiding my true feelings, even from myself, but now they're all coming out. What a lot of feelings!"
363,363,4,Jeremy,True,4,Home studio slipping away.
364,364,4,Jeremy,False,25,"No really, I mean it. I mean I like you. I mean fuck that, I love you. And I want to have sex with you."
365,365,4,Jeremy,False,19,"Come on, mate, let me have a go on the old gear stick. I'll take it up to fourth."
366,366,4,Jeremy,True,33,"So, as it stands, I'm failing to find work as a prostitute. That doesn't feel good. Still, got his house keys. If I keep working for him, he'll have to keep paying me."
367,367,4,Jeremy,False,1,Foz?
368,368,4,Jeremy,False,7,"Well, not servant really, more of a-"
369,369,4,Jeremy,False,8,That's just the normal ringing noise. That's normal.
370,370,4,Jeremy,False,14,"Cheer up, Mark. At least now you've got a funny story to tell people."
371,371,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Hi honey, you're home!"
372,372,5,Jeremy,False,11,"So, listen, you know how depressed you are about getting married?"
373,373,5,Jeremy,False,69,"It's in four weeks, Mark. It's going to happen. Look, no matter how unpalatable it may be, the fact is, I'm your best friend. And I know you don't wanna hear it but, I love you. And, in your own dried up, desiccated, weird and unfriendly way, you love me too. So, I've got together my last scraps of cash to give you the stag weekend of your dreams!"
374,374,5,Jeremy,False,73,"Yes. I've booked us a canal boat near an Iron Age area, and you can go and look at the Iron Age or whatever it is you do, and I'll make us some steaks. And I've sent off for a chess set and I'll learn how to play but, if I'm not good enough, then there's a computer setting. Or, I'll be pretending to play but really you'll be playing the computer. OK?"
375,375,5,Jeremy,False,1,Oh?
376,376,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Right, and yet you seem excited because...?"
377,377,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Oh yeah, the Stag Aquatic. So, come on, let's max out the engine a bit. Tear it up."
378,378,5,Jeremy,False,5,What if we hit trouble?
379,379,5,Jeremy,False,19,"Right, but this is just it? This is totally it? There's not gonna be any waves or mad shit?"
380,380,5,Jeremy,False,7,Can I water ski off the back?
381,381,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Jesus. Well let's stop here, then, and go for a drink."
382,382,5,Jeremy,False,28,"Well, what else are we gonna do? Just sit here freezing out nuts off, talking to each other? I mean, what the hell are we gonna talk about?"
383,383,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Sure, yeah, I suppose. So how do you feel now the wedding's back on track?"
384,384,5,Jeremy,False,16,"Oh, right, not that. Well, what then? I can't think of anything to say. You start."
385,385,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Oh, for God's sake. If we're gonna talk, let's talk about something proper, like films."
386,386,5,Jeremy,True,25,This weekend is gonna be one massive dry hump. Maybe the pressure will build to the point where we actually try to fuck each other.
387,387,5,Jeremy,False,16,"Yeah, well, I'm sorry. You can so tell this game is over a thousand years old."
388,388,5,Jeremy,False,6,I don't wanna play any more.
389,389,5,Jeremy,False,25,"No, not because you're win- I don't even know who's winning! Here, Mark, I'll tell you what. You piss in this bottle, I'll drink it."
390,390,5,Jeremy,False,6,"For a laugh, it's the stag."
391,391,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Oh, that is great. You wouldn't even let me drink your piss. I'm not trying to kiss you, Mark. It's liquid waste."
392,392,5,Jeremy,False,7,You wouldn't let me drink your piss?
393,393,5,Jeremy,False,3,For a laugh!
394,394,5,Jeremy,False,10,"I'm just bored, OK? I'd let you drink my piss."
395,395,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Oh, come on, let's get out of here. It's doing our nuts in. Let's go and get you some sweet punani action."
396,396,5,Jeremy,False,22,"Here, look, take it. And the horsey. Come on, man! Couple of pints, couple of hotties, yeah? Come on tiger, let's roar!"
397,397,5,Jeremy,False,14,I'm stagging you. I'm stagging you by the back door. This is your stag
398,398,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Two yards of ale, please. It's his stag."
399,399,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Hello. Check it out, Mark."
400,400,5,Jeremy,False,5,Let's go and say hello.
401,401,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Come on, man."
402,402,5,Jeremy,False,3,They want it.
403,403,5,Jeremy,False,2,Like what?
404,404,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Bollocks, they're hot and they want it. Come on."
405,405,5,Jeremy,False,25,"Hey there, we just wondered, if you don't mind hanging out with a couple of yardies, whether maybe we could join you for a drink."
406,406,5,Jeremy,False,3,Jez and Mark.
407,407,5,Jeremy,False,15,"Yep, so, listen, what can I get you two? How about a foot of wine?"
408,408,5,Jeremy,False,27,"Oh, right now we're called Various Artists, just to fuck over people with iPods. We think it'll set us back two or three years, which is cool."
409,409,5,Jeremy,False,6,"We're canalists, too, we love canaling."
410,410,5,Jeremy,True,8,He really knows how to murder a vibe.
411,411,5,Jeremy,False,10,"Mummy? Wow, doesn't your mum mind the dog being called-"
412,412,5,Jeremy,False,1,Right.
413,413,5,Jeremy,False,9,This is going great. Things are going to happen.
414,414,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Look, just forget about Sophie, all right? You're allowed a freebie on the stag. Like Pej in Estonia."
415,415,5,Jeremy,False,9,"It's what people do, just get on with it."
416,416,5,Jeremy,False,23,"Do you think Pej fancied that hooker? Of course he didn't. But he didn't let that stop him, he did the right thing."
417,417,5,Jeremy,False,20,"You can't go to bed, there are two of them, there has to be two of us, that's the law."
418,418,5,Jeremy,False,56,"You're not going anywhere, Mark. You can't say you're going to bed at nine in the evening. You're gonna sit there and smile, and talk about something funny you've seen on reality TV. And stop going on and on about the Euro. We're in it now, and there's nothing you can do about it, so just-"
419,419,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Morning, shipmate."
420,420,5,Jeremy,False,11,"Oh, just getting going. Couldn't let them get away, could we?"
421,421,5,Jeremy,False,5,"It's not, it's just friendly."
422,422,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Ahoy there, shipmates!"
423,423,5,Jeremy,False,3,Ha! You're on!
424,424,5,Jeremy,False,5,"Warp factor three please, Scotty."
425,425,5,Jeremy,False,17,"So I'm not in a relationship right now. I've just been hurt too many times, you know?"
426,426,5,Jeremy,False,28,"Yeah, it's like I've got a river of pain running through me, from here, right the way down to here. Kind of like Jim Morrison or Russell Brand."
427,427,5,Jeremy,False,3,"Sure, no sweat."
428,428,5,Jeremy,True,7,Four by four. Piece of piss. Probably.
429,429,5,Jeremy,True,7,"God, look at me drive. I'm Clarkson."
430,430,5,Jeremy,False,8,"Oh, trust me, these babies run on anything."
431,431,5,Jeremy,False,5,Just the two of us?
432,432,5,Jeremy,False,1,Cool.
433,433,5,Jeremy,True,35,"Oh, God, I think I love her. I think I'm falling in love. Or getting a bone on, which is basically the same thing when you get rid of all the Valentine's cards and bullshit."
434,434,5,Jeremy,True,32,"Oh yeah, pissed and stoned in a gas-guzzler. This is the life. Already given a quid to Greenpeace this year, so I'm golden. Not the dog, not the dog. Shit, the dog!"
435,435,5,Jeremy,True,25,"Oh, yeah, this is cool. Just don't think about the dead dog. If I don't think about it, there's always a chance it didn't happen."
436,436,5,Jeremy,False,1,Mummy?
437,437,5,Jeremy,False,7,Are you sure she was with us?
438,438,5,Jeremy,False,4,She must've run off.
439,439,5,Jeremy,True,12,"Except she definitely hasn't, 'cause I'm carrying her round in this bag."
440,440,5,Jeremy,False,22,"She is a wild animal, you know. The call of the wild? She might've become leader of a pack of foxes or-"
441,441,5,Jeremy,True,15,"Why did I put her in the bag? I should've thrown her, like a discus."
442,442,5,Jeremy,False,1,Mummy.
443,443,5,Jeremy,False,1,Mummy.
444,444,5,Jeremy,True,7,"Well, you're very close to finding out."
445,445,5,Jeremy,False,1,Mummy!
446,446,5,Jeremy,False,1,What?
447,447,5,Jeremy,False,2,"Right, so?"
448,448,5,Jeremy,False,1,No?
449,449,5,Jeremy,False,3,Couldn't she come?
450,450,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Brilliant, well done, mate."
451,451,5,Jeremy,False,4,"So, you'd just go?"
452,452,5,Jeremy,False,5,I could be your butler.
453,453,5,Jeremy,False,58,I could probably live like a king on a tenner a week. I'd do fuck all. Just lie around smoking dope and then maybe have a bit of a go on the washing up before you got home. I'd probably get a record deal just because I've been to Carnaby Street. I'll be the coolest man in India.
454,454,5,Jeremy,False,6,"All right, keep your voice down."
455,455,5,Jeremy,False,11,"I don't know, Mark, but there's no point shouting about it."
456,456,5,Jeremy,False,18,"Look, earlier, in the four by four, I had an accident. I mean, the clutch on that thing!"
457,457,5,Jeremy,False,21,I had to hid it. Aurora had me looking for it for about four hours. And she made me make posters.
458,458,5,Jeremy,False,20,"Mark, if I can just get rid of the dog corpse, there's a chance I still might get laid, here."
459,459,5,Jeremy,False,4,This doesn't feel great.
460,460,5,Jeremy,False,17,"There's no chance of it being traced back to us now, though, 'cause it might've been microchipped."
461,461,5,Jeremy,False,8,There's a hell of a lot of steam.
462,462,5,Jeremy,False,10,"I mean, it's going a bit, just not the legs."
463,463,5,Jeremy,False,23,"Oh, right! I have to put the legs back on. If you hadn't refused to pay for firelighters, it would've gone by now."
464,464,5,Jeremy,False,8,"How would you know? Shit, it's going out."
465,465,5,Jeremy,False,8,"We'll have to bury it, get the spade."
466,466,5,Jeremy,False,5,You didn't bring a spade?
467,467,5,Jeremy,False,17,"Oh, great! So we've got no fire, no spade. We'll just have to dig with our hands."
468,468,5,Jeremy,True,23,"I'll just take it to one of those massive council bins. Dump and run, just like my paper boy days. Screw you, Murdoch."
469,469,5,Jeremy,False,1,Hi.
470,470,5,Jeremy,False,9,"Yep, good, got rid of all of mine, too."
471,471,5,Jeremy,True,23,"Just keep lying till the kissing can start. I mean, it'd have to be a fucking good poster to get that dog back."
472,472,5,Jeremy,False,1,OK.
473,473,5,Jeremy,True,5,"Shit, gotta dump the evidence."
474,474,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Yeah, so I have. Thanks, honey."
475,475,5,Jeremy,True,12,"Just act normal. I'll tell her what happened, immediately after I've cum."
476,476,5,Jeremy,False,6,"Um, we're interrupting, we should probably-"
477,477,5,Jeremy,False,7,"Oh, Mark and I had a barbecue."
478,478,5,Jeremy,False,9,"No, no, not really, no, we were really hungry."
479,479,5,Jeremy,False,19,"It's really, really badly cooked, we didn't cook it at all well, Mark couldn't be bothered to get firelighters."
480,480,5,Jeremy,False,7,I really don't think it's a good-
481,481,5,Jeremy,False,5,It's turkey. It's turkey leg.
482,482,5,Jeremy,False,9,What can I tell you? I'm no Ainsley Harriott.
483,483,5,Jeremy,False,12,"Nothing, it's just turkey, look. You see? Mmm, just under-cooked, disgusting turkey."
484,484,5,Jeremy,False,6,Hey Mark! Would you like some?
485,485,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Here, eat some turkey!"
486,486,5,Jeremy,False,19,"I really feel, since I'm eating turkey, you should eat some turkey. It was your idea to barbecue it."
487,487,5,Jeremy,True,11,I'm eating dog leg. I have definitely reached a new low.
488,488,5,Jeremy,False,5,It's just a hairy turkey!
489,489,5,Jeremy,False,10,Mummy is probably the turkey's nickname! It could easily be.
490,490,5,Jeremy,False,4,"Aurora, I'll call you."
491,491,5,Jeremy,True,23,"God, probably good things didn't work out with her, she is totally overreacting. It's not like I ate her mum or her dad."
492,492,5,Jeremy,False,23,"I don't know, I keep wondering that. But, you know, in the moment, it really did feel like I needed to eat it."
493,493,6,Jeremy,False,9,"I know, one pretty amazing unofficial stag night, yeah?"
494,494,6,Jeremy,False,11,Did you slink off to bed before we did the melon-off?
495,495,6,Jeremy,False,16,"Two guys get hard-ons, they put melons on their dicks, first melon to fall off loses."
496,496,6,Jeremy,False,24,"Yeah. Lovely clean Nancy all over our filthy, horrible sofa. Things are looking up. Right, the farewell breakfast. I'm making you the last breakfast."
497,497,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Yup, sit down, I'm making toast. One brown, one white. White's the pudding, yeah?"
498,498,6,Jeremy,False,31,"Oh, one of Super Hans' quite menacing friends started burning faces in the Mighty White with cigarettes, so that's all gone. But, um, how about a cream cracker and a Ryvita?"
499,499,6,Jeremy,False,3,Bit the same.
500,500,6,Jeremy,False,19,"No, OK, sorry. Well, I'll just run out and get us some coffees and croissants and freshly squeezed OJ."
501,501,6,Jeremy,False,39,"Well I haven't got very much cash at the moment and no one round here really does that sort of thing. But I would, if you wanted. I mean, I will. I mean, obviously I can't, but I would."
502,502,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Hey, Nance, how was the sofa?"
503,503,6,Jeremy,False,2,Super Hans!
504,504,6,Jeremy,False,6,"So, looking forward to the wedding?"
505,505,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Why are you not coming, Nance? Too many memories?"
506,506,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Of us, of our wedding. Where we got married?"
507,507,6,Jeremy,False,6,"I know, I forget too sometimes."
508,508,6,Jeremy,True,24,"Shit, it's happening, she's out of my life, forever. What am I gonna do? Could pretend it's not happening. That's worked for everything else."
509,509,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Uh, Nancy, don't have the melon, that's not good melon."
510,510,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Bit tense, wedding nerves."
511,511,6,Jeremy,False,1,What?
512,512,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Uh, no, I don't think so, mate."
513,513,6,Jeremy,False,5,I don't really want to.
514,514,6,Jeremy,False,5,That isn't the reason why.
515,515,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Well, no, 'cause the truth is, there is no speech."
516,516,6,Jeremy,False,34,"Oh, come on, mate. We both know you're not gonna marry Sophie today. It's making you tense, nervous and unhappy. You're gonna stay here with me. I don't make you tense, nervous or unhappy."
517,517,6,Jeremy,False,67,"Oh, come on, not to nearly the same extent. And what's gonna happen to me? I mean, Nancy's going back to America. I mean, am I gonna live here, like, on my own? Who am I gonna go to the pub with? And who's gonna do the forms for, like, the TV and the gas and the water? Me?! Don't you see? None of this works, Mark."
518,518,6,Jeremy,False,43,"OK, so I thought I'd start with, ""I will now do my best to give Mark the six most uncomfortable minutes of his life. And the six most uncomfortable minutes of Sophie's life will be coming up later this evening, courtesy of Mark."""
519,519,6,Jeremy,False,10,It does not sound like you're going to attack her.
520,520,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Well, I'd have to pay for another opening joke."
521,521,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah, that was a ""risqué icebreaker"". Would you prefer a ""conservative icebreaker""?"
522,522,6,Jeremy,False,19,"OK, I'll do conservative icebreaker, met at college material, couple of middle-of-the-road inebriation gags. Bang, I'm out of there."
523,523,6,Jeremy,False,22,"Oh, yeah, he's on the dry heaves, so the upholstery should be fine. I don't think he'll die, he never normally dies."
524,524,6,Jeremy,False,6,"Are you all right, Super Hans?"
525,525,6,Jeremy,False,17,"You said you were on the dry heaves. That wasn't a dry heave, that was a wetty."
526,526,6,Jeremy,False,21,"You're really gonna do this, aren't you, you maniac? You're actually going to marry Sophie and leave me on my own."
527,527,6,Jeremy,False,13,"I know why you're doing this, Mark. You're marrying her to spite me."
528,528,6,Jeremy,False,25,This is you all over. You'd rather get married for the whole of your life than consider that maybe I might be right about something.
529,529,6,Jeremy,False,2,You OK?
530,530,6,Jeremy,False,12,"OK, right. That is maybe a sign that everything isn't totally groovy."
531,531,6,Jeremy,False,25,"Brilliant! Let's call this mother off. The El Dude brothers are back! One thing, you have left it pretty late, it will be a jilting."
532,532,6,Jeremy,False,10,I think anything on the wedding day is a jilting.
533,533,6,Jeremy,False,10,But that implies he could have jilted her somewhere else.
534,534,6,Jeremy,False,2,Nancy! Hello?
535,535,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Brilliant, all right, hold on. I'll be right there."
536,536,6,Jeremy,False,12,"OK, let's go. Fuck Super Hans, he'll be fine. Let's leave him."
537,537,6,Jeremy,False,13,"Well, obviously it's not what either of us would ideally like to do."
538,538,6,Jeremy,False,1,Exactly.
539,539,6,Jeremy,True,24,"Pretty straightforward conflict here, he wants us to go to the wedding, I want to see Nancy. But I'm the one holding the wheel."
540,540,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Oh, it's a short cut."
541,541,6,Jeremy,False,22,"All right, look, we're just making a little detour. Nancy wants to come to the wedding. We'll just nip over to Heathrow..."
542,542,6,Jeremy,False,6,Just tell her on the phone.
543,543,6,Jeremy,False,18,"I really don't think that's a distinction as big in reality as it is in your mind, Mark."
544,544,6,Jeremy,False,4,We're going to Nancy's.
545,545,6,Jeremy,False,12,You're a love rat. One hour isn't gonna make any fucking difference.
546,546,6,Jeremy,False,25,"Mark, we're in the middle of the road. You're gonna get us killed for the sake of your legacy. Stop it! You're not fucking Blair!"
547,547,6,Jeremy,False,14,"All right, fine, bloody hell. Let's go and give Sophie a nice timely jilting."
548,548,6,Jeremy,False,10,"For the record, Nancy's not bullshit. She does love me."
549,549,6,Jeremy,False,4,"No, of course not."
550,550,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Yeah, I'm glad we've cleared the air."
551,551,6,Jeremy,False,41,"Oh my God. Guess what? Nancy's coming after all, Super Hans is giving her a lift on Chemical Kev's moped. He's only bloody come through for me. Count the kisses, Mark. She's happy and she wants to kiss me, four times."
552,552,6,Jeremy,False,15,"Yeah, but on the plus side, Nancy's gonna be there, probably in a lovely dress."
553,553,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Well, you did basically arrange a wedding."
554,554,6,Jeremy,False,4,I know a reason.
555,555,6,Jeremy,False,21,"I've got a reason, for you not to marry Sophie. But you have to promise you won't be angry with me."
556,556,6,Jeremy,False,13,"No, God, something else. But you've got to promise not to be angry."
557,557,6,Jeremy,False,16,"OK. Well, actually, I did get off with her. I snogged her at the JLB conference."
558,558,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Well, I thought you might be angry."
559,559,6,Jeremy,False,5,"Look, I am very sorry."
560,560,6,Jeremy,False,3,"No, course not."
561,561,6,Jeremy,False,7,"Well, sorry, yeah, we did a bit."
562,562,6,Jeremy,False,22,"I mean, not really an actual affair. We had a snog. I mean, these things happen, Penny. We were both very drunk."
563,563,6,Jeremy,False,6,"A bit of tongues, not much."
564,564,6,Jeremy,False,11,"So, what do you reckon? Are you getting married or not?"
565,565,6,Jeremy,False,30,"It can't be moot, you can't have a moot wedding. You need to decide man. I mean personally I think we should leave a note and get the fuck out."
566,566,6,Jeremy,False,12,"Yeah, well, you need to decide 'cause I'm going for a piss."
567,567,6,Jeremy,True,81,"Oh, this is gonna be horrible. Obviously he's gonna get married, and he'll never let me forget the kiss, and Sophie will never forgive me for telling him. Am I actually going to piss on the church? It'd be quite a statement. Yeah, baby, here I go. Richard Dawkins walks the walk, but he does he actually follow through with an actual act of piss? Oh, shit! Sophie's dad! Didn't even get to bloody wee. Typical, it's all, him, him, him."
568,568,6,Jeremy,False,3,Sophie's dad's coming!
569,569,6,Jeremy,False,2,What? Why?
570,570,6,Jeremy,False,11,"But what about my piss? I really need to wee, Mark."
571,571,6,Jeremy,True,21,"Oh, ""Hold it in"", he says. This is like a Japanese game show. Next he'll put an octopus over my face."
572,572,6,Jeremy,False,5,Were you praying just then?
573,573,6,Jeremy,False,25,"God, I am dying for a piss. I feel like someone's inflating a balloon full of urine inside me, and not in a good way."
574,574,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Where's Nancy? Why still no lovely Nancy? Oh, fuck! Sophie!"
575,575,6,Jeremy,False,1,Twenty-eight.
576,576,6,Jeremy,False,9,"I really need to get to a urinal, Mark."
577,577,6,Jeremy,False,3,You are joking?
578,578,6,Jeremy,False,2,I'm excited.
579,579,6,Jeremy,False,3,Best of three?
580,580,6,Jeremy,False,3,Best of five?
581,581,6,Jeremy,False,9,"Great, let's get out of here. I am busting."
582,582,6,Jeremy,False,4,You're over-ruling the coin?
583,583,6,Jeremy,False,2,A text?
584,584,6,Jeremy,False,9,You want me to send all that to everyone?
585,585,6,Jeremy,False,15,"OK, fine, man, but first I can't go on any longer. My bladder, I'm busting."
586,586,6,Jeremy,False,7,Let me piss in that prayer bucket.
587,587,6,Jeremy,False,8,"OK, I'm gonna creep up to the bucket."
588,588,6,Jeremy,False,10,What am I gonna do then? I can't hold on.
589,589,6,Jeremy,False,6,You're telling me to piss myself?
590,590,6,Jeremy,False,6,Is this what it's come to?
591,591,6,Jeremy,False,17,Great and what shall I do after I've pissed myself? Fuck myself? Eat myself? You're such a-
592,592,6,Jeremy,False,41,"Yes, I'm doing it already. I'm so pathetic that as soon as you ordered me to piss myself, I started the procedure. This is what you've done. You've ground down my sense of self-worth over the years. I hope you're proud."
593,593,6,Jeremy,False,4,Not for a bit.
594,594,6,Jeremy,False,3,I can't stop!
595,595,6,Jeremy,False,14,"Oh, ""piss yourself"", ""stop pissing yourself"", it's not that simple! The floodgates are open!"
596,596,6,Jeremy,False,9,"You're being a real dick about this, aren't you?"
597,597,6,Jeremy,False,10,"Come on! He got married, didn't he? Leave him alone."
598,598,6,Jeremy,False,22,"OK. It'll be all right, mate. You can still come round. I'll keep your room just the same, like if you'd died."
599,599,6,Jeremy,True,42,"OK, it's happened, he's gone. I'm on my own. This is a disaster. I need to take stock. I need to reassess. I need to find someone who can sell me some weed. Where's Nancy? Her lovely face always makes- Oh, fuck!"
600,600,6,Jeremy,False,4,"Are you OK, man?"
601,601,6,Jeremy,False,5,Do you want some company?
602,602,6,Jeremy,False,20,"And your hat and shoes smell of puke. So I guess neither of us are exactly the king, are we?"
603,603,6,Jeremy,False,2,Drive on!
604,604,6,Jeremy,False,20,"No, she did. With Super Hans. So, that's nice. I think I might divorce her, see how she likes that."
605,605,6,Jeremy,False,22,"Yeah, I was pretty pissed off about that. But, I was thinking of waiting for a bit before I brought it up."
606,606,6,Jeremy,False,13,"It's fine, I'll just chuck it in with all my other mouldering resentments."
607,607,1,Mark,False,25,"Soph, it's the wedding list. If some dupe wants to buy us the gold standard of sugar bowls, I say milk them till they're dry."
608,608,1,Mark,True,28,"How the fuck did it come to this? I'm getting married to a woman I may not love, and I've got stupid fashionable hair all over my face."
609,609,1,Mark,False,5,"No, sure, of course not."
610,610,1,Mark,True,29,"It's only a sugar bowl. Hopefully, I won't even get married. If I do, eventually it'll get chipped or broken. Then I'll get the sugar bowl of my dreams."
611,611,1,Mark,False,5,"Um, some of my clothes."
612,612,1,Mark,False,20,"Soph, no need for new stuff. I've got three pairs of trousers and loads of shirts that aren't worn out."
613,613,1,Mark,True,4,I'm a bearded concubine.
614,614,1,Mark,False,8,"You do know who that is, don't you?"
615,615,1,Mark,False,19,"Exactly, the man was responsible for the deaths of sixty million people. I don't want him on my chest."
616,616,1,Mark,False,13,"It's not a competition, Soph. Although if it was, Mao would probably win."
617,617,1,Mark,False,11,This is just a zip. There's no pocket to this zip.
618,618,1,Mark,True,32,"That's the way things are these days. Let's just put a zip here, a swastika there, why not? Who knows what these things were once used for. Who the hell even cares?"
619,619,1,Mark,False,4,"Hi, guys, Super Hans."
620,620,1,Mark,False,14,Sophie bought it for me and I decided to wear it home. How funny.
621,621,1,Mark,False,2,"What, why?"
622,622,1,Mark,False,13,What's wrong with us wearing the same clothes? Are you embarrassed that we're-
623,623,1,Mark,False,10,"We're not clashing, we're matching. That's the opposite of clashing."
624,624,1,Mark,False,7,"No, it's new. I'm wearing it in."
625,625,1,Mark,False,6,"Sorry, but we'd better get going."
626,626,1,Mark,False,36,"Jeremy, a carton of Mars Bar milk, a small bag of marijuana and a pirated DVD of Anchorman is not ""important stuff"". She really wants you to come. You're sort of part of the family now."
627,627,1,Mark,False,14,"Look, I picked up ""Music Of The Royal Tournament"" for only £2.99 Pretty tasty."
628,628,1,Mark,False,70,"Look, I know I might have mentioned some doubts, but that was pub talk. You can't bring up pub talk in the cold light of day. You know how I get after the pub, like when I ordered the Abdominizer. Besides, she's good for me, Jez, she's dragging me into the 21st century, with its meaningless logos and ironic veneration of tyrants. It's all good, my friend. It's all good."
629,629,1,Mark,True,19,"Gotta make a good impression, hit my key features. I'm dependable, but not afraid of the occasional premium lager."
630,630,1,Mark,False,3,The feeling's mutual.
631,631,1,Mark,False,8,"Oh, thank you. You're obviously very attractive too."
632,632,1,Mark,True,13,"Oh, what next? Am I going to tell her she's got lovely tits?"
633,633,1,Mark,False,9,"So, how do you think I'm doing so far?"
634,634,1,Mark,True,6,"Of course, she would say that."
635,635,1,Mark,False,7,"How do you think it's going, Jez?"
636,636,1,Mark,False,1,Cool.
637,637,1,Mark,True,42,"Oh, God. The first fiancé challenge and I've got a gun. An actual gun. It's OK, it's perfectly normal, this is the country, this is what farmers do. They go around shooting crows and trespassers and eventually, because of the EU, themselves."
638,638,1,Mark,False,6,"Oh, do you not believe in-?"
639,639,1,Mark,True,7,"Don't ask why. Don't ask, don't tell."
640,640,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
641,641,1,Mark,False,16,"Jeremy, please, I need to make a good impression. Jamie's not such a bad guy. Stay."
642,642,1,Mark,False,8,Of course I'm not going to shoot you.
643,643,1,Mark,False,9,"I got it. I got one, I got one!"
644,644,1,Mark,False,4,"Oh, is that not-?"
645,645,1,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
646,646,1,Mark,False,3,"What, shall I-?"
647,647,1,Mark,False,2,Its neck?
648,648,1,Mark,True,29,"This is the ultimate good impression test. If I can do this, I'll never have to carve a chicken or discuss spark plugs or prove I love his daughter."
649,649,1,Mark,False,5,There's blood all over me.
650,650,1,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
651,651,1,Mark,False,5,"Oh, great, a whole evening."
652,652,1,Mark,True,4,"Oh shit, oh no."
653,653,1,Mark,True,26,I have very little to say to my closest friends. What the hell am I gonna say to a fully grown man for a whole night?
654,654,1,Mark,False,4,That's me all right.
655,655,1,Mark,True,1,Probably.
656,656,1,Mark,False,4,"Yes, I do, sir."
657,657,1,Mark,True,6,"Ugh, ""sir"". This isn't Tennessee, Mark."
658,658,1,Mark,False,5,"Right, yeah, that's good advice."
659,659,1,Mark,True,32,"Oh, God, here we go. He's got no-one else to talk to but the sheep and the trees. This is what happens if you live too far from proper franchised coffee outlets."
660,660,1,Mark,False,11,"Well, that's good, 'cause me and Soph, it's, you know... love."
661,661,1,Mark,True,22,"Or my fear of loneliness and her strong desire to get pregnant by almost anyone, so long as it happens this year."
662,662,1,Mark,True,6,"Goodbye beard, hello familiar, stupid face."
663,663,1,Mark,False,24,"Er, yeah, yeah. I think so. But it got me thinking about Sophie and the wedding and how I probably don't properly love her."
664,664,1,Mark,False,11,"Yes. I think... I think I'm gonna call it off, Jez."
665,665,1,Mark,False,1,Yes.
666,666,1,Mark,False,22,"Well I had to pretend that, even to myself. I mean, what sort of man would grow an unwanted beard to order?"
667,667,1,Mark,False,15,"I don't know, it's difficult. I mean, ideally, it would be somewhere with nice surroundings."
668,668,1,Mark,False,17,"Somewhere with flowers, coffee and sedatives, medical assistance. Maybe with music, but not too jaunty. Melancholy music."
669,669,1,Mark,False,17,"Oh shit! That'll be Sophie, looking for nookie. I can't see her now, pretend to be asleep."
670,670,1,Mark,False,25,"I can't do it now. You don't just declare war, Jeremy. You prime the press, you square the UN, you make up your reasons. Snore."
671,671,1,Mark,False,9,"No, just... practicing. I was showing Jeremy some techniques."
672,672,1,Mark,False,6,"Please, no. Please, tell me no."
673,673,1,Mark,False,13,"That, the smutty smile. Jeremy, please tell me that nothing's going on there."
674,674,1,Mark,False,9,Let's just say that nothing is going on there.
675,675,1,Mark,False,20,"Oh, my God, you didn't! You fucked her! Jeremy, you need chemical castration, you're out of control! That's Sophie's mother!"
676,676,1,Mark,False,47,"She's not out of Hollyoaks Jeremy! She probably had a ration book! Oh, you're a piece of work, aren't you! I'm down in the pub putting the hours in with the dad and you're back at the house banging the mum! That is not a good impression."
677,677,1,Mark,False,12,"Jeremy, please, don't smile like that. You're not James Bond. You're disgusting."
678,678,1,Mark,False,22,"No, it's fine. I mean, if I wasn't here I'd just be sitting around with Soph. I can see her any time."
679,679,1,Mark,False,4,"Shh, can he hear?"
680,680,1,Mark,False,29,"I don't know, maybe. I mean, she's so nice. So what if I don't really love her. Charles didn't really love Diana and they were all right. Sort of."
681,681,1,Mark,False,2,"What, no."
682,682,1,Mark,False,3,"No, I didn't."
683,683,1,Mark,False,19,"No, no, because of... distortion. There was probably a buzz. There might be an ancient Saxon coin right here."
684,684,1,Mark,False,13,"Yes, that's what I've actually been thinking. That's what I'm gonna tell her."
685,685,1,Mark,True,7,The good-impression thermometer is reaching absolute zero.
686,686,1,Mark,False,6,"For what it's worth, I'm sorry."
687,687,1,Mark,False,3,"Well, thank you."
688,688,1,Mark,False,30,"Ian, I just wanna say that I know that people can be very stupid and selfish but really, it's our fast-food culture of instant gratification you should be angry with."
689,689,1,Mark,False,6,"Er, well maybe we should just-"
690,690,1,Mark,False,25,Or you could just post something negative on the internet or blank him in the Post Office? That would send out a pretty horrible message.
691,691,1,Mark,False,11,And you're sure you're poking the right man in the eye?
692,692,1,Mark,True,30,"Well, this is not what I expected. You think you'll be playing Simpsons Monopoly and you end up an arsonist. Still, at least it's not me he's trying to incinerate."
693,693,1,Mark,False,27,"Right, so instead of you facing up to your responsibilities, poor old Dan's going to wake up with his barn burned, saying goodbye to his no-claims bonus."
694,694,1,Mark,False,26,"I suppose you're right. Plus, maybe burning stuff is... not normal but less of a big deal out here than it is in a major conurbation."
695,695,1,Mark,False,4,"Like scrumping, for apples."
696,696,1,Mark,True,8,"Oh God, I'm a firestarter. A twisted firestarter."
697,697,1,Mark,False,9,Happy birthday. I hope it'll be a memorable day.
698,698,1,Mark,True,17,Of course it's gonna be memorable. The day she's humiliated and broken in front of her family.
699,699,1,Mark,False,35,"Oh, that. When I was shaving, I sort of slipped and I tried evening it out but it just got smaller and smaller until I looked like an evil overlord, so I just lost it."
700,700,1,Mark,False,2,I know.
701,701,1,Mark,True,34,"Yes, your jurisdiction over my face is hereby rescinded. Shit. But can I really break it to her? Should I? I mean, she's lovely, she's attractive. She does irritate me, but everyone irritates me."
702,702,1,Mark,True,34,"Oh, my God. Nana probably needs the roof and brickwork looked at but apart from that, this is premium real estate. Quick sale, then a cottage in the Ardennes. Or a flat in Barcelona."
703,703,1,Mark,False,2,I know!
704,704,1,Mark,True,29,"Who cares if I don't know if I properly love her? She could have the flat in Barcelona, I can live in the Ardennes. We'd hardly see each other."
705,705,1,Mark,False,2,Happy birthday.
706,706,1,Mark,False,29,"Right, it's just, as a matter of fact, I've had a bit of a think and I'm not really sure I want to- I don't think I want to-"
707,707,1,Mark,False,16,"God, no, not because of Nana's cottage. Of course not, there are a lot of factors."
708,708,1,Mark,False,12,"Myriad factors, I can't just think off the top of my head."
709,709,1,Mark,False,3,"Oh, just metal."
710,710,1,Mark,True,9,And the fact that I don't really love you.
711,711,1,Mark,False,6,Anyone for a game of Risk?
712,712,1,Mark,False,1,Cranium?
713,713,1,Mark,False,1,Me?
714,714,1,Mark,False,7,"The truth? ""You can't handle the truth!"""
715,715,1,Mark,False,11,"Do you know, I fancy a nap. A nice relaxing nap."
716,716,1,Mark,False,7,That is a terrible thing to say.
717,717,1,Mark,False,20,The truth... the truth is that I love Sophie very much and am very much looking forward to marrying her.
718,718,1,Mark,False,13,"Well, I may be many things but at least I'm not a barn-burner."
719,719,1,Mark,False,34,"He did it. He made me and Jeremy watch, so we'd be accessories to the crime, but I'm breaking down your wall of silence, Ian. Even if you did threaten to break my fingers."
720,720,1,Mark,False,6,"I'm sorry, Sophie, that wasn't true."
721,721,1,Mark,False,10,"Yes, he has gone like a bit of a maniac."
722,722,1,Mark,False,12,"In fact, I think it's probably time you took your leave, Ian."
723,723,1,Mark,True,47,"OK, in a way, I've made a good impression. I mean, it wasn't me who set fire to the barn or screwed Penny. In fact, I'm winning. I'm getting half a rural cottage and all I have to do is enter a loveless husk of a marriage."
724,724,1,Mark,True,41,"Am I evil? I don't feel evil. It's a nice cottage. He did burn the barn. Maybe I've gone over the edge, I no longer know right from wrong. Maybe I'm capable of murder. It would certainly make life more interesting."
725,725,1,Mark,False,5,"See you in London, Soph."
726,726,1,Mark,False,4,I love you too.
727,727,1,Mark,True,24,"It's OK, everyone says it. I say I love Häagen-Dazs and my broadband provider, and I like Sophie more than them, in most respects."
728,728,1,Mark,False,7,Let's get the hell out of here.
729,729,1,Mark,False,2,Floor it.
730,730,2,Mark,False,10,"Hi, Alan, you wanted to talk about- oh, I'm sorry..."
731,731,2,Mark,False,2,"Ha, great."
732,732,2,Mark,False,3,Project Zeus? What's-
733,733,2,Mark,False,2,"Oh, right."
734,734,2,Mark,True,22,I do sort of like it when he's rude to me. Hopefully that's more a psychological defect than a weird sexual thing.
735,735,2,Mark,False,19,"I don't know Alan, thousands of reasons, but also kind of... none. But won't Marketing kick up a shit-storm?"
736,736,2,Mark,False,1,Christ.
737,737,2,Mark,False,1,OK.
738,738,2,Mark,True,18,"I'm going to be Johnson's queen. If the public will accept me, I'm going to be Johnson's queen."
739,739,2,Mark,True,28,My team. I'm going to be the most amazing boss ever. I'm going to have them eating out of my hand while I squeeze them by the balls.
740,740,2,Mark,False,5,Are you all right to...
741,741,2,Mark,True,9,That's not business-like. It's not even a proper disability.
742,742,2,Mark,False,39,"Right, well, thanks, guys, for coming to the first get-together of the Project Zeus work group. First up, remember, this is a brainstorm. I'm not judging, it's an ideas party, so before we start the pitter-patter of grey matter"
743,743,2,Mark,True,5,that is a brilliant jokette
744,744,2,Mark,False,5,I'll go get the pizzas.
745,745,2,Mark,True,8,Hot cheesy pizza to max out your stomach-acid.
746,746,2,Mark,False,29,"I'm just telling them it doesn't matter what they say tonight, when actually, I'll be keeping a rigorous note of every contribution. Jeremy, have you been eating my pizza?"
747,747,2,Mark,False,6,"Can you get that, please, Jeremy?"
748,748,2,Mark,False,1,Alan!
749,749,2,Mark,True,8,"Oh, he is good. Taboo-busting, semi-incomprehensible pep talk."
750,750,2,Mark,False,54,"So, finance, logistics, et cetera. These are the key tasks for you to get done for my presentation, and I just want you to have fun with these. Don't sweat it, go mental. But then go sane again and check and re-check, 'cause I'm gonna be the guy up there pitching this stuff, OK?"
751,751,2,Mark,True,17,"Tube up his nose, tube up his nose. He's a man with a tube up his nose."
752,752,2,Mark,False,8,"Yep, just relax and take your time, OK?"
753,753,2,Mark,True,25,"Ugh, Kettering. Got to force Sales and Marketing together with my bare hands, and all I've got to help me is this bunch of mooks."
754,754,2,Mark,False,41,"OK, well, Johnson will be here around three, so I just want to pull together your individual work ahead of the big presentation tomorrow, so what have you got? Have you got the logistics figures, Lisa? The finance projections, Katie? Jeff?"
755,755,2,Mark,False,6,"So, you're kidding? You've got nothing?!"
756,756,2,Mark,False,33,"Well, I didn't actually mean relax and take your time! Jesus, I'm giving the presentation tomorrow! Johnson will be here at three! Don't you get it? My balls are on the line here!"
757,757,2,Mark,False,16,"I don't care how you do it, as long as you fucking well do it, OK?"
758,758,2,Mark,False,60,"That sounds interesting. I tell you what, why don't I take that, 'cause I'm going to the loo in a minute, and I can have a look at it, and then I can wipe my fucking arse on it! If we're integrating two departments and it's a nightmare, how exactly is putting a third in gonna help? You dick pole!"
759,759,2,Mark,False,3,"But, you can't."
760,760,2,Mark,False,3,Well it's not.
761,761,2,Mark,False,3,"No, I didn't."
762,762,2,Mark,False,4,That was an accident.
763,763,2,Mark,False,43,"It could have been. I was careful to be sure that it could have been. Come on, Soph, you want us to enjoy the executive lifestyle together. I was nice to you, even when you gave me that shit about the earnings projection."
764,764,2,Mark,True,7,"Oh, sure, it's nice to be nice."
765,765,2,Mark,True,16,"Yeah, have your nice fancy dinner, till the bill comes and the bodies start piling up."
766,766,2,Mark,False,2,"OK, fine."
767,767,2,Mark,False,14,"Well, I guess it's just Gerrard and me from here on in, right, Gerrard?"
768,768,2,Mark,False,12,"I said it's just you and me from here on in, right?"
769,769,2,Mark,False,25,"Cool, cool, dude. Sit down, clear your tubes, 'cause you and me are gonna chow down on the biggest hairy motherfucking business shit-storm since Enron."
770,770,2,Mark,True,39,"Sales, Marketing, Marketing, Sales. All I'm doing is scrolling up and down this useless document, inserting words almost at random. I suppose I can always roll Gerrard out for the sympathy vote. He's my dark secret, my Elephant Man."
771,771,2,Mark,False,12,I can see it's you. What the hell are you doing here?
772,772,2,Mark,False,15,"You're following Johnson and Big Suze, aren't you? You're gonna do something disruptive, aren't you?"
773,773,2,Mark,False,17,Why do you even want to get back with her? She was really starting to annoy you.
774,774,2,Mark,False,15,"Oh, right, so now she's finished with you, suddenly you're in love with her again?"
775,775,2,Mark,False,1,Johnson.
776,776,2,Mark,False,4,"Yeah, this is Camilla."
777,777,2,Mark,True,25,"God, that's so humiliating. Why couldn't we have been Holmes and Watson? Or Ben and Jerry? Even Bernie Winters and Schnorbitz would've been an improvement."
778,778,2,Mark,True,2,Oh shit.
779,779,2,Mark,False,12,"Oh, it's going really well, actually. I think I've cracked it, Alan."
780,780,2,Mark,False,19,Although there are actually a few pesky I's to dot and a few T's for me and Gerrard to-
781,781,2,Mark,False,1,Alan-
782,782,2,Mark,True,13,"Oh, great. I'm going out with literally the worst men in the world."
783,783,2,Mark,False,7,Wasn't that last one a bit... thin?
784,784,2,Mark,True,15,"Oh my God, this is horrible. Urgh, she's touching the tube! That can't be hygienic."
785,785,2,Mark,False,7,"Oh, it is looking so good, Alan."
786,786,2,Mark,True,25,Maybe I can work in a back room. There must be a back room somewhere that isn't full of mobsters or sallow men getting wanked.
787,787,2,Mark,False,15,"No, Suze, I- I really don't think I really have time, and Soph and everything."
788,788,2,Mark,False,3,"Suze, I really-"
789,789,2,Mark,True,8,"I'm being forced into this, that's the line."
790,790,2,Mark,False,2,"Uh, Mar-tin."
791,791,2,Mark,True,105,"Oh great, here we go. I'm just another cock getting wired into the global economy. Urgh, how should I look like? Bond-like neutrality? As though I'm so used to real-life naked women? Or... don't want to be rude. Smiling encouragement? That's not a leer, is it? Got to avoid the leer at all costs. And the dribble. Oh God, she looks amazing. This really should not be allowed. This is what men want, and we shouldn't be allowed to have it, because it's horrible and it makes you feel sick. Oh great, now I'm getting an erection. How grimly predictable. When's the work gonna happen?"
792,792,2,Mark,False,20,"I'm very sorry, and you're a very attractive woman, but I have got a hell of a lot on, so..."
793,793,2,Mark,False,17,"No, no, you go ahead, you're obviously very talented, but I should just get on with this."
794,794,2,Mark,False,5,"Oh, just a proposal, so..."
795,795,2,Mark,False,23,"Right, this is a very complex business proposal, so I really don't think you could sum up all the aims in one line."
796,796,2,Mark,False,9,"Look, my aims are not too fucking diffuse, OK?"
797,797,2,Mark,True,9,"Great, now I'm getting an angry lap dance, brilliant."
798,798,2,Mark,False,6,Relaxed. I feel really very relaxed.
799,799,2,Mark,False,18,"Hello, just need to grab some files and some ProPlus and Nurofen. I'm pulling an all-nighter with Gerrard."
800,800,2,Mark,False,10,"Yeah, will you be OK? There's always the bathroom floor."
801,801,2,Mark,False,4,"Good, that sounds nice."
802,802,2,Mark,True,44,"Why are they being so nice? Maybe they've been having a big chat about me and they've suddenly realised that I was right about North Korea, I was right about the European Constitution, and by God, I think I'm right about the Congestion Charge."
803,803,2,Mark,True,27,"Oh my God, I feel terrible. I feel like my head's gonna explode. Relax, Mark, heads don't explode. It's much more likely you'll just get a tumour."
804,804,2,Mark,False,26,"So, half an hour till the board roll in and I pitch this mother. This is it, it's just you and me from here on in."
805,805,2,Mark,False,10,I said it's just you and me from here on.
806,806,2,Mark,False,83,"Yes, of course. OK, so, final analysis. What have we actually got, what am I gonna present to the board? Not that, that sounded good at 3am when we were high on Diet Coke. That's bullshit. That's just table talk, that's not fit for public consumption. This... is that it? Where's the actual sustenance, where's the beef? Gerrard, we've got... there's... nothing. I've got nothing, I've got fucking nothing here. We haven't got anything. We've spent all night doing nothing, Gerrard, you prick!"
807,807,2,Mark,False,6,"You cocksucker, you stomach-levels bullshit wanker!"
808,808,2,Mark,True,9,I've lost my Elephant Man. My beautiful Elephant Man.
809,809,2,Mark,False,18,"Jeff. Jeff, listen, Jeff. Your- your idea. Have you still got the printout, the idea, the three-department merger?"
810,810,2,Mark,False,14,"Yeah, except that wasn't actually that funny, was it? Have you got a copy?"
811,811,2,Mark,False,1,What?
812,812,2,Mark,False,9,"You know what this piece of paper says, Jeremy?"
813,813,2,Mark,False,9,This piece of paper says that I am fucked.
814,814,2,Mark,False,6,It's my plan for Project Zeus.
815,815,2,Mark,False,19,That's what I've got to go through that door and pitch to the entire JLB board in ten minutes.
816,816,2,Mark,False,19,I'm about to walk into a boardroom gangbang and get fucked by the biggest swinging dicks in corporate strategy.
817,817,2,Mark,False,3,"Right, thanks Jez."
818,818,2,Mark,False,9,"Right, well in this case, there would be repercussions."
819,819,2,Mark,False,6,I suppose I could run away.
820,820,2,Mark,True,49,"God, I'm running away. This is brilliant. Maybe I'll go to a KFC and have a whole bargain bucket. Or I could join Al Qaeda. Maybe I'll marry my lap dancer. I do think, in a weird way, we had a connection. Fuck the Blockbusters fine, I'm going clear!"
821,821,2,Mark,True,44,"Shit, this could be difficult to row back from. This isn't a misspelt email. This is going feral. I mean, rejecting society and seeking the company of wild creatures, that's not going to look good on my quarterly review. What's Jeremy stealing, hotel napkins?"
822,822,2,Mark,False,1,Soph!
823,823,2,Mark,False,13,"It doesn't work, Soph. Project Zeus, it's unworkable. What am I gonna do?"
824,824,2,Mark,False,23,"The truth? Soph, this isn't an advert, this is real life, where cocks get chewed off and arses get stuffed with compliance reports!"
825,825,2,Mark,False,4,Do you really think?
826,826,2,Mark,False,39,Maybe she's right. Maybe the truth does work. Maybe Iraq was a good idea. Maybe I am putting enough into my pension plan. Maybe computer games aren't a waste of time. Maybe OJ's innocent! Maybe everything's gonna be OK!
827,827,2,Mark,False,13,"Yeah, well, I don't play by the rule book, what can I say?"
828,828,2,Mark,False,6,Every window is also a door.
829,829,2,Mark,False,11,"Well, that depends. I mean, not tiny windows like lavatory windows."
830,830,2,Mark,False,1,Right.
831,831,2,Mark,True,10,"Here I go, palms dry, mouth dry, inter-buttock area moist."
832,832,2,Mark,False,68,"So, integrating Sales and Marketing, Project Zeus. The bad news is, it doesn't work. But, look, big picture, so what? Maybe we shouldn't be in the credit business at all. Maybe we should look at human rights or global warming. I mean, these are just ideas, but... where's the humanity? I suppose that's what I want to ask you today, if anything, where is the humanity? Old friend."
833,833,2,Mark,True,20,"Shit, I'm crashing and burning. That stupid bloody hippie sold me down the river. Plan B. What is plan B?"
834,834,2,Mark,False,21,"Right, OK, you can stop the murmuring. Please stop murmuring. Unless you think it's nice to murmur at someone who's... dying!"
835,835,2,Mark,True,10,Did I just say that? I did just say that.
836,836,2,Mark,False,43,"Yep, that's right, I've got brain cancer. Half my brain's been eaten away already, probably, but I think I did a pretty decent job for a man with a brain tumour the size of a pineapple who's gonna be dead within a month."
837,837,2,Mark,True,8,"Uh, plan C, is there a plan C?"
838,838,2,Mark,False,6,"My brain, my poor diseased brain!"
839,839,3,Mark,False,4,Yep. Everything all right?
840,840,3,Mark,True,34,"It's what I said about her trainers. She shouldn't have asked me if she didn't want to know. They are a bit clumpy. She's so moody. I'm marrying her, what more does she want?"
841,841,3,Mark,False,4,What are you doing?
842,842,3,Mark,False,32,"Right. Good to be prepared. Jeremy, is that post? Are you doodling on my post? When exactly were you going to tell me about this? Oh my God. It's from Matt Townsend!"
843,843,3,Mark,False,27,"He's only the best personal trainer is South London according to Johnson. He's got a window. Jeremy, he's got a window and he's opening it for me."
844,844,3,Mark,False,27,"Just joining a gym. Get some exercise and some time, not away from Sophie, just without her. You should join up too, you get a free pen."
845,845,3,Mark,False,28,"Yeah, well, the world is my gym too, it's just the bit of it that's actually a gym, that's going to be my gym. Is that Big Suze?"
846,846,3,Mark,False,13,So I take it you haven't got over her going off with Johnson.
847,847,3,Mark,True,11,My new life has begun. Everything is going to be different.
848,848,3,Mark,False,2,"OK, yeah."
849,849,3,Mark,True,17,That's probably exactly the kind of bullshit I'm going to need to believe in my new life.
850,850,3,Mark,False,2,My goals
851,851,3,Mark,True,6,Does hiding from my fiancée count?
852,852,3,Mark,False,16,"No goals, really. Apart from trying not to die and get in shape for my wedding."
853,853,3,Mark,False,1,Thanks.
854,854,3,Mark,True,29,"It's fine, just a couple of normal guys. Oh great, here comes the inevitable massive dong. Just look away. If I don't look at it, it can't hurt me."
855,855,3,Mark,False,7,"Oh no, God, I'm over the moon."
856,856,3,Mark,False,8,"Oh, uh, no. No, I shower at home."
857,857,3,Mark,False,15,"Sure, yeah I'm down with that. No, it's just at home I have a system."
858,858,3,Mark,False,32,"Yeah, it's complicated. I don't want to waste water so I have my own methods, but they're all totally normal. I'll explain them to you sometime over a beer. See you Friday."
859,859,3,Mark,True,29,"Oh, that was horrible. Now he probably thinks I'm embarrassed about the size of my penis, when in fact I'm not. I'm much more concerned about my misshapen scrotum."
860,860,3,Mark,False,16,"Oh my God, Nancy! I didn't know you were, I mean, I haven't seen you since-"
861,861,3,Mark,False,8,"Yeah, so what have you been up to?"
862,862,3,Mark,False,10,"Oh, right. Well, it's really nice to see you again."
863,863,3,Mark,False,10,"Oh, yeah. Cranking at the IMAX. Don't I know it."
864,864,3,Mark,True,81,"I've got to tell Jez about Nancy. This will blow him away, or could tip him over the edge. Maybe it would be kinder not to tell him. It would certainly give me a weird feeling of secret power. Jesus, what's that man doing? I should do something. If decent people like me do nothing, then what? Then they'll come for the trade unionists, although that, to be honest, wouldn't really bother me too much. Hey, I know that weird run!"
865,865,3,Mark,False,1,Jeremy?!
866,866,3,Mark,False,6,What the hell are you doing?!
867,867,3,Mark,False,19,"For God's sake, Jeremy, that's the post you set fire to, the Royal Mail. That's like burning a swan."
868,868,3,Mark,True,9,"I've already done running today, this is unnecessary exercise."
869,869,3,Mark,True,1,Finally.
870,870,3,Mark,True,18,"I should tell him about Nancy, but I don't want to distract him from this massive dawning realisation."
871,871,3,Mark,False,9,Last night you were in a very emotional state.
872,872,3,Mark,True,15,And by the morning the weird feeling of secret power had started to wear off.
873,873,3,Mark,False,16,"It's good though, isn't it, the gym? Kind of like being the member of a club."
874,874,3,Mark,False,7,"Excuse me, Eva? We're out of juice."
875,875,3,Mark,False,9,"Still, if it's unwritten... we do need more juice."
876,876,3,Mark,True,8,"Well, she's shitting on the gentleman's club vibe."
877,877,3,Mark,False,2,Another one?
878,878,3,Mark,False,21,"They're worth fourteen pounds each, I've only got three left, and I'd like the option to give one to someone else."
879,879,3,Mark,False,13,"Yes, one of my friends. Or, I might need one for an emergency."
880,880,3,Mark,False,9,"Well, maybe you should take that as a sign."
881,881,3,Mark,False,8,"Right, the epigram that starts the stalker's manifesto."
882,882,3,Mark,False,24,It's pretty much a clean bill of health. I did think I had ringworm once but it turned out to be a cigarette burn.
883,883,3,Mark,False,1,Sorry?
884,884,3,Mark,False,3,"Oh, right. Great."
885,885,3,Mark,True,40,"There isn't any chance at all I'm going to get an erection, is there? Oh my God, a man's hands all over my naked body. I'm so tense, I'm like Waterford Crystal, I'm going to smash into a thousand pieces."
886,886,3,Mark,False,3,"Yeah, kind of."
887,887,3,Mark,False,16,Well I- I suppose the truth is I'm not really sure I want to get married.
888,888,3,Mark,True,33,Urgh. It's like he's got one hand on my body and the other in my brain. Leave my brain alone. I get my brain training from Sudoku and Alain de Botton's weekly podcasts.
889,889,3,Mark,False,21,"I make my own sandwiches, Jeremy. Making your own sandwiches is not an indication of a gritty life on the never-never."
890,890,3,Mark,False,26,Just make sure you clean up in the changing room toilet. There's a big pool of rusty water by the urinals and it turns my stomach.
891,891,3,Mark,False,1,Hello?
892,892,3,Mark,False,13,"Oh, just hanging out in the gym. You know, pushing for the burn."
893,893,3,Mark,False,15,"Yeah, I'd love to, it's just I've got a session booked with Matt and uh..."
894,894,3,Mark,True,7,"Ha ha. Physical well-being, the perfect alibi."
895,895,3,Mark,False,4,"OK then, see you."
896,896,3,Mark,False,1,Sophie.
897,897,3,Mark,True,28,"Might as well pile on a few more spoonfuls. Who cares if I put on a bit of weight? I'm engaged to be married, mating season is over."
898,898,3,Mark,False,19,"This is just fuel for the engine, Soph. I'll burn this off on the treadmill in, like, a second."
899,899,3,Mark,True,2,Uh oh.
900,900,3,Mark,False,17,"Um, yeah. I mean, you've got to be realistic, we're no Edward and Mrs. Simpson, but, yeah."
901,901,3,Mark,True,7,I think that was a good answer.
902,902,3,Mark,False,1,Um...
903,903,3,Mark,True,3,Where's this going?
904,904,3,Mark,False,6,"Well, yeah, I think we do."
905,905,3,Mark,True,1,Shit!
906,906,3,Mark,False,6,"Oh, well, that would be... great."
907,907,3,Mark,True,26,"Brilliant, she's located my bunker and now she's invading. She's flushing me out with dogs and grenades, and a sincere desire to spend time with me."
908,908,3,Mark,True,23,Why do they have to park the bikes right in front of the sexualizer? Be so demeaning to get a bonk-on while exercising.
909,909,3,Mark,True,10,What am I meant to say? Can I say no?
910,910,3,Mark,False,3,I want it.
911,911,3,Mark,True,7,"He's broken me, I'll say anything now."
912,912,3,Mark,False,11,"Well, I was late in so, the fridge was bare, I..."
913,913,3,Mark,False,4,"Pizza, from San Marco's."
914,914,3,Mark,True,2,"Oh, God."
915,915,3,Mark,True,5,Could claim mine is better.
916,916,3,Mark,False,1,Yours.
917,917,3,Mark,False,6,Going to the pub with Jeremy.
918,918,3,Mark,False,2,Her? Why?
919,919,3,Mark,False,9,"Right, yeah, but be a bit quiet, maybe, Matt."
920,920,3,Mark,False,1,No!
921,921,3,Mark,False,28,"No, I don't want it, all right? Fuck off. You've made it too hard, I can hardly fucking pedal. No mountain is that hard, it's just not realistic."
922,922,3,Mark,False,23,"OK, I've got two bits of bad news, one affecting me, and the other affecting you. Which do you want to hear first?"
923,923,3,Mark,False,21,"OK, Nancy told me she spoke to Matt at Judo class and she's going to ask him out on a date."
924,924,3,Mark,False,21,"Yeah well, she said she decided it wouldn't be so bad spending all day eating bananas, and fucking with Matt Townsend."
925,925,3,Mark,False,6,Sophie's planning to join the gym.
926,926,3,Mark,False,11,Because I've told Matt I don't really want to marry her.
927,927,3,Mark,False,10,"She's getting dangerously close to my web of lies, Jez."
928,928,3,Mark,False,45,"No, she can't ever know! It's all arranged, Jeremy, it's an arranged marriage. My dad literally congratulated me, Jez. He sent me a greetings card with a pre-printed message expressing a good deal of happiness. This is my chance to be a proper human being."
929,929,3,Mark,False,25,"And now Matt's going to spill the beans to Sophie or to Nancy and then she'll tell Sophie. What am I going to do, Jez?"
930,930,3,Mark,False,13,"Jeremy, both of us can't pace. It's like a prison yard in here."
931,931,3,Mark,False,7,We need to get rid of Matt.
932,932,3,Mark,False,15,We need a clever plan. What would de Botton do? An evil Alain de Botton?
933,933,3,Mark,False,10,"De Botton wouldn't kill, we're not going to kill him."
934,934,3,Mark,False,7,That's not beyond the realms of possibility.
935,935,3,Mark,False,17,"Yes, could work. Although, I suppose, I mean, one of us would have to... in the pool."
936,936,3,Mark,False,8,Really? I did not know that about you.
937,937,3,Mark,False,8,"I really don't feel comfortable about this, Jez."
938,938,3,Mark,True,18,"Well this is going to be incredibly painful, but at least I'm doing the right thing. Sort of."
939,939,3,Mark,True,8,"Oh, my God! He actually- he couldn't resist!"
940,940,3,Mark,False,11,"Well, I didn't actually see him, but I have my suspicions."
941,941,3,Mark,False,10,He mentioned to me that he likes to do that.
942,942,3,Mark,False,8,"Yes, he said he loves to do that."
943,943,3,Mark,False,15,"Oh uh, yes. I didn't want to mention that but... Matt, he touched my penis."
944,944,3,Mark,False,1,Yes.
945,945,3,Mark,False,39,"Well, he was giving me a massage and he was going up my legs and my thighs, and then he touched my penis, and then he rubbed my penis quite a bit. I said stop, but he wouldn't stop."
946,946,3,Mark,False,3,Because it's true.
947,947,3,Mark,True,30,"Oh, God, this is all so horrible. Maybe it would have been simpler just to kill him. I should know how to kill someone by now, I've watched enough CSI."
948,948,3,Mark,True,36,"Maybe we'll be happy ever after. Maybe I'll look back and say Judo brought us together. Maybe we'll have a Judo-themed wedding, and get married in Judo suits, and I'll cut the cake with my hand."
949,949,3,Mark,True,21,"Shit, Matt. He wants to punch and kick me, and he's come somewhere where he's allowed to punch and kick me."
950,950,3,Mark,False,9,"Matt, I thought you weren't working here any more."
951,951,3,Mark,False,3,Leave me alone.
952,952,3,Mark,False,6,He is going to hurt me.
953,953,3,Mark,False,3,"He's here, too."
954,954,3,Mark,False,11,"It's all right, Jez. Use your woman as a human shield."
955,955,3,Mark,False,8,He thinks we can't stay hiding here forever.
956,956,4,Mark,True,15,"What a dud evening. Low quality takeaway, low quality detective drama, low quality sexual intercourse."
957,957,4,Mark,False,13,"So, Soph, do you fancy coming along to my school reunion on Saturday?"
958,958,4,Mark,False,45,"Yeah, but I thought it might be nice to go and, you know, show them all that I've got a job and a flat and a fiancée now. And I'm not in fact a gender bender, a mentaloid or a public leaning post after all."
959,959,4,Mark,False,2,What thing?
960,960,4,Mark,False,11,Jeff's going to Frankfurt? You're going to Frankfurt with your ex?
961,961,4,Mark,False,8,"No, no, no you did not mention it."
962,962,4,Mark,False,8,"Yes, I know now. But I didn't before."
963,963,4,Mark,False,2,All right.
964,964,4,Mark,True,12,"OK, definitely have a legitimate grievance here I reckon. Let's milk it."
965,965,4,Mark,False,2,"Yeah, sure."
966,966,4,Mark,True,57,"Maybe I should just go on my own. Sally Slater might be there. Mm, Sally, one of the few girls in my year to notice me and yet still not mock. It'd be good to see her again, and I'm sure Sophie won't mind. In fact, she's definitely not gonna mind 'cause I'm not gonna tell her."
967,967,4,Mark,False,14,"By your job, you mean being a handyman for a man called The Orgazoid?"
968,968,4,Mark,False,15,"What?! Come on Jeremy, nobody gets paid five hundred pounds a week to do nothing."
969,969,4,Mark,False,52,"No, there's got to be a catch. You're gonna be his drugs mule. He's gonna sell your organs or invite a German around from the internet to eat you. And where did you even meet him? The snooker club that used to be a public toilet? Seriously, I'm concerned about this arrangement."
970,970,4,Mark,False,8,"All right, whatever. Look, I'm going out so-"
971,971,4,Mark,False,4,Just to a nightclub.
972,972,4,Mark,False,21,"Yes, well as you're always saying, the Beastie Boys fought - and possibly died - for my right to party so..."
973,973,4,Mark,False,17,"All right, look, I've been invited to the Polefield School reunion at a school disco club, and-"
974,974,4,Mark,False,34,"Well, the vast majority, but there were some crumbs of comfort. The chess players, the musicians, the poor and the posh-voiced. We formed a substrata, a secret society below the radar of the norms."
975,975,4,Mark,False,7,"The normallows, the Norman forces, our oppressors."
976,976,4,Mark,False,7,Haven't you got work in the morning?
977,977,4,Mark,False,6,"Here they all are, my tormentors."
978,978,4,Mark,False,63,"That's Faizel Butt. He used to call me a flod. I think it was a mixture between a flid and a spod. That's Foz. He used to sit behind me in French and put bacon on my shoulders. That's Terry Carpenter. One of the more sophisticated bullies. Pretended I was Thatcher and he was Heseltine, and I needed ousting. I need a drink."
979,979,4,Mark,True,67,"Oh my God, there she is. Lovely Sally Slater. I should speak to her, but what the hell can I say? Anything that doesn't mention I masturbate over her memory is probably good. I mean I think that's a compliment, but women just don't seem to want to hear it. No, just spend the evening looking longingly at her from a distance, like the good old days."
980,980,4,Mark,False,31,"Yeah, I forget, are you Sally? Good to see you. I have a job and a flat of my own now, so... it's great to see you. God, you look great!"
981,981,4,Mark,False,3,"Oh, OK, great."
982,982,4,Mark,True,25,Maybe everything will be different now. Maybe all the parameters have shifted. Most of my rivals from school have probably perished in Blair's oil wars.
983,983,4,Mark,False,30,"Right, that's cool, I hoover sometimes because I bought my flat and that. From my job as an executive, I had plenty of cash left over to buy a hoover."
984,984,4,Mark,False,29,"No. I mean maybe a bit. Do you remember on that history field trip where you borrowed my Hitchhiker's Guide, and we both read it out in funny voices?"
985,985,4,Mark,False,14,I was thinking that was probably one of the best days of my life.
986,986,4,Mark,True,31,"Should I feel guilty? No, Sophie's probably doing it with Jeff to the brutal rhythm of the Oompah band. Why shouldn't I have some mild flirtation? A snog even? Or more?"
987,987,4,Mark,True,4,"Oh, great, bacon shoulders."
988,988,4,Mark,False,2,"Hi, Foz."
989,989,4,Mark,True,8,"Please don't hit me for any reason, Foz."
990,990,4,Mark,False,3,"Oh, right, great."
991,991,4,Mark,True,22,"Obviously, of course. Why didn't I just buy an anvil and smash my face onto it? It would certainly be less hassle."
992,992,4,Mark,False,5,So have you got kids?
993,993,4,Mark,False,33,"Oh, no reason. I mean, I love kids. Not in a bad way, in a nice way. I mean I'm not on the child protection register... yet! Which proves I'm not a paedo!"
994,994,4,Mark,True,7,This is going horribly. Need a joke.
995,995,4,Mark,False,7,Either that or I'm an incredibly-hard-to-detect paedo.
996,996,4,Mark,True,8,Just move on from the paedo area entirely.
997,997,4,Mark,False,7,"Jez, this is Foz and Sally, Jeremy."
998,998,4,Mark,True,43,"Oh, just like school. I have to sit and watch while the beautiful people dance at me. Except no, she wants me to call her. It's worked. All my references to how much above the national average income I earn have actually worked!"
999,999,4,Mark,False,7,"OK, well great chatting to you, Sally."
1000,1000,4,Mark,False,14,And good luck with Midnight's Children. Remember no one's ever actually finished it. Bye.
1001,1001,4,Mark,True,30,"Great call, friendly but flirty. Didn't overstep the mark. I could show Sophie the transcript. Maybe I should start taping my phone calls. No, Mark. That's how they got Nixon."
1002,1002,4,Mark,False,2,What's that?
1003,1003,4,Mark,False,11,He bought you a jumper? What else has he bought you?
1004,1004,4,Mark,False,13,"Jeremy, what's going on? Squash racquets are not a normal form of remuneration."
1005,1005,4,Mark,False,16,"So listen, I've organised a trip to the safari park on Saturday with Sally and Foz."
1006,1006,4,Mark,False,5,It's an ironical day out.
1007,1007,4,Mark,False,16,I am not a dirty dog. But I do need you to come. As my... sheath.
1008,1008,4,Mark,False,20,"Yes, as long as you are there, it's just four people having an apparently nice time at an outdated venue."
1009,1009,4,Mark,False,27,"Sophie has not called me once yet. So there is actually a perfectly valid excuse for what I'm almost certainly not going to try to do, OK?"
1010,1010,4,Mark,False,18,If she promised she wasn't a Glenn Close type and happened to have a recent clean AIDS certificate?
1011,1011,4,Mark,False,9,That's a hypothetical question. I don't answer hypothetical questions.
1012,1012,4,Mark,False,1,Exactly.
1013,1013,4,Mark,True,31,What exactly is my plan here? Lured them all to the safari park like a Bond villain. But what's the aim? Torture myself with contact with an unattainable woman? Or... what?
1014,1014,4,Mark,False,7,That's because it's not a real job.
1015,1015,4,Mark,False,8,"Don't flaunt your wad, Jeremy, it's not becoming."
1016,1016,4,Mark,False,1,Hey!
1017,1017,4,Mark,False,4,"Give it back, Jeremy!"
1018,1018,4,Mark,False,3,Give that back!
1019,1019,4,Mark,False,4,"Jeremy, for God's sake."
1020,1020,4,Mark,False,14,"Foz, stop the car. Stop the car, Foz. He's- he's thrown my wallet out."
1021,1021,4,Mark,False,7,"No, we need to call the... warder."
1022,1022,4,Mark,False,6,What if the lions eat me?
1023,1023,4,Mark,False,6,You should go and get it.
1024,1024,4,Mark,False,8,Why should I have to bloody get it?
1025,1025,4,Mark,False,2,Fucking hell.
1026,1026,4,Mark,True,41,"Shit, this isn't good. There are lions, there are lions everywhere. Where are they? Is there one behind that tree? Jeremy's literally thrown me to the bloody lions. What's next, crucifixion? Is he gonna have me actually nailed onto a cross?"
1027,1027,4,Mark,False,10,You bloody bastards! Stop! Let me in! You bloody bastards!
1028,1028,4,Mark,True,29,"Christ, what do you do to avoid lion attack? Soil yourself? Or is that grizzly bears? Hate to shit myself for no reason and get eaten. The final humiliation."
1029,1029,4,Mark,True,34,Still nothing from Sophie. Probably busy boning Jeff in Frankfurt. Highly unlikely but possible. I should at least try to feel jealous and betrayed. Then I'll feel less of a shit about pursuing Sally.
1030,1030,4,Mark,False,3,"Oh, hi Jez."
1031,1031,4,Mark,False,1,Nancy.
1032,1032,4,Mark,False,10,"You're here, I thought you'd be down at The Orgazoid's."
1033,1033,4,Mark,False,7,"Well, yeah, but are you all right?"
1034,1034,4,Mark,True,13,What's bothering him? He's thinking about something. He never normally thinks about things.
1035,1035,4,Mark,False,2,My computer?
1036,1036,4,Mark,True,1,Sally!
1037,1037,4,Mark,False,1,Sure.
1038,1038,4,Mark,False,1,Hello?
1039,1039,4,Mark,False,4,"Oh good, good thanks."
1040,1040,4,Mark,False,21,"Oh, don't worry, that's fine. It was funny, probably, if it hadn't been happening to me, it might have been funny."
1041,1041,4,Mark,False,6,"Oh right, well, I'd love to."
1042,1042,4,Mark,False,6,"Yeah, the flat, that sounds lovely."
1043,1043,4,Mark,True,24,"I can't invite her around here. Anyone could be here. Sophie will find out. Nothing's gonna happen, but nothing must remain a total secret."
1044,1044,4,Mark,False,8,"My address, hold on let me just check."
1045,1045,4,Mark,False,8,"Well, I do like to be totally accurate."
1046,1046,4,Mark,False,5,"Jez, what's Orgazoid- Russell's address?"
1047,1047,4,Mark,False,5,Just give it to me.
1048,1048,4,Mark,False,7,"Because I'm a dirty dog, all right."
1049,1049,4,Mark,False,4,"Hey, 31 Bishop's Avenue."
1050,1050,4,Mark,False,7,"Yep, see you there th- here then."
1051,1051,4,Mark,False,18,"All right, so Jez, do you think it'll be all right if I sort of borrowed Russell's house?"
1052,1052,4,Mark,False,15,"Well that's OK, if you'd prefer, you can just give me the keys and I'll-"
1053,1053,4,Mark,False,2,Yeah? Why?
1054,1054,4,Mark,False,3,"Duties, what duties?"
1055,1055,4,Mark,False,1,Yes.
1056,1056,4,Mark,False,5,You gave him a hand?
1057,1057,4,Mark,False,16,"You helped him out by giving him a hand. Wow, just to clarify, you do mean..."
1058,1058,4,Mark,False,1,Shit.
1059,1059,4,Mark,True,9,"I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!"
1060,1060,4,Mark,False,7,"God, that's a really a tough decision."
1061,1061,4,Mark,True,8,"Stay, stay so I can use the house."
1062,1062,4,Mark,False,26,"Mm-hmm, yeah. I know what you mean, I feel the same sometimes when I come back from JLB and I've had to do loads of spreadsheets."
1063,1063,4,Mark,False,21,"Welcome to the world of work, Jeremy. You know, you don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps."
1064,1064,4,Mark,False,23,"This is it. I call it a flat because I'm quite modest, but as you can see, it's actually quite a massive house."
1065,1065,4,Mark,True,16,"Shit, am I seriously hoping to have sex with Sally Slater? This is all very wrong."
1066,1066,4,Mark,True,14,"Relax, you don't go to adulterer's prison for drinking tea and playing Connect Four."
1067,1067,4,Mark,False,23,"There's not much else he can do in the real world, and I've been very lucky and I like to spread that around."
1068,1068,4,Mark,True,19,Glad I sprayed my nuts with aftershave though. You never know how things might turn out. I'm no Nostradamus.
1069,1069,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh, I just really appreciate the male form."
1070,1070,4,Mark,False,30,"Yeah, there is something beautiful about the male member. It's good to have a look at it now and again. A reminder of what can happen if you're not careful."
1071,1071,4,Mark,True,15,What am I saying? At least he's going. Don't need a witness to this fiasco.
1072,1072,4,Mark,False,34,"Here, Sally, I got you a present. Hitchhiker's Guide, it's the same copy we read from at Sutton Hoo. I got it signed by Douglas Adams when he came to the big WH Smiths."
1073,1073,4,Mark,False,35,"Our affair? OK, that sounds good. What sort of affair were you thinking of? The Dreyfus Affair or more like the Watergate Affair? 'Cause I can tell you right now I'm not burgling any Democrats."
1074,1074,4,Mark,True,42,"Oh my God, she's gonna kiss me. I'm such a bastard. I'm meant to be getting married. I'm out of my depth. I thought she was a frightened, little suburban mouse. But no, she's my nightmare. A liberated, sexually adventurous urban woman."
1075,1075,4,Mark,False,8,"Oh, Sally, Look, I'm really not sure I..."
1076,1076,4,Mark,True,31,"What am I doing? This isn't me, I can't have an affair. I'm not French. I'm the least French person on the planet. My favourite cheeses are Cheddar and Red Leicester."
1077,1077,4,Mark,False,67,"Look, no, I'm sorry Sally. I just don't know if I can do this. I mean, you've got your miserable relationship and the truth is I have got one of my own. And I just feel that, you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And even if it is broke, just ignore it and maybe it'll be sort of OK? Like the environment. Who's that?"
1078,1078,4,Mark,True,5,Is Russell back? Oh no!
1079,1079,4,Mark,False,1,Foz!
1080,1080,4,Mark,False,16,"Well, I mean, I suppose you are sort of trying to. Look, the door's locked and..."
1081,1081,4,Mark,True,3,"Great, thanks Jeremy."
1082,1082,4,Mark,False,8,"I can't hide, I'm not a good hider."
1083,1083,4,Mark,True,21,What the hell am I doing? I'm doing a Jeremy. This is a wake-up call. I've definitely hit a new low.
1084,1084,4,Mark,True,4,"Shit, now she calls."
1085,1085,4,Mark,True,6,Must hide more. Can't hide more.
1086,1086,4,Mark,False,15,"Er... yes, yeah that's what I'm doing. I'm spying on her and wanking over her."
1087,1087,4,Mark,False,4,"Uh-huh, I suppose so."
1088,1088,4,Mark,True,14,"Wow, he didn't hit me. Bit disappointing. I sort of deserve to be hit."
1089,1089,4,Mark,False,10,"Yes, no, I guess this is a pretty funny story."
1090,1090,4,Mark,True,14,"One that I'll never, ever tell anyone because of my deep and burning shame."
1091,1091,5,Mark,True,40,"Ugh, more data entry tonight. I guess the only good thing is that my life is so boring it feels like it might go on forever. Maybe I'll put on Big Bond Themes and pretend I'm data entering for MI6."
1092,1092,5,Mark,False,2,Hi Jez.
1093,1093,5,Mark,False,25,"What? Let's not drag that up now, I'm looking forward to it, that's the line. Besides, it's possible I might have found a way out."
1094,1094,5,Mark,False,1,Really?
1095,1095,5,Mark,False,22,"Well, well that's nice. That actually sounds fun. Unfortunately, as I said, I think I might not be getting married, after all."
1096,1096,5,Mark,False,16,"Yeah, Sophie's twigged something's ""not right"" and she's arranged for us to see a relationship counsellor."
1097,1097,5,Mark,False,55,Because it's all gonna come out! The whole disgusting mess. She'll wheedle it all out. It'll take hours to break me down but then it'll all spill out and Sophie won't be able to shout at me because there'll be a professional there. And none of it's even my fault! It's all my so-called subconscious.
1098,1098,5,Mark,True,15,"Oh yeah, here we are. The Field of Screams, the torture chamber. The emotional dungeon."
1099,1099,5,Mark,False,14,"Oh, she is good. Here it comes, let it all flood out. Just, gently."
1100,1100,5,Mark,False,10,"Me? Oh, I'm feeling pretty positive. Obviously, some tiny doubts..."
1101,1101,5,Mark,True,3,Don't overdo it.
1102,1102,5,Mark,False,4,...mainly about the catering.
1103,1103,5,Mark,True,48,"Hold on, is that it? Is that my go finished? Did she just believe what I said? What kind of counselling is that? She didn't wheedle anything out of me! How am I supposed to blow my emotional beans if she doesn't at least give me a wheedle?"
1104,1104,5,Mark,False,2,I'm sorry?
1105,1105,5,Mark,False,4,"Oh, right, are there?"
1106,1106,5,Mark,False,1,Unfilled?
1107,1107,5,Mark,False,28,"Right, well, I mean, I suppose I thought that maybe Sophie might be one of those women who find it difficult, or even impossible to attain- to achieve-"
1108,1108,5,Mark,False,1,Right.
1109,1109,5,Mark,True,5,This isn't gonna be good.
1110,1110,5,Mark,False,13,"Uh-huh. Thanks for that, Soph. Great, well, I'll make a note of that."
1111,1111,5,Mark,False,9,"Well, this has been great, just a great time."
1112,1112,5,Mark,False,3,"Really, forty-five minutes?"
1113,1113,5,Mark,True,23,"Oh great, so I'll be spending one pound a minute to hear how shit I am at sex. Now that's value for money."
1114,1114,5,Mark,False,6,So good to just get away.
1115,1115,5,Mark,False,6,"Actually, this is almost top speed."
1116,1116,5,Mark,False,14,"I don't think we're going to hit trouble on the Shropshire Union Canal, Jeremy."
1117,1117,5,Mark,False,1,No.
1118,1118,5,Mark,False,5,You're very welcome to try.
1119,1119,5,Mark,False,6,"Jez, it's ten in the morning!"
1120,1120,5,Mark,False,17,"I dunno, stuff! Banter, chat. Isn't that what you had in mind when you organised this thing?"
1121,1121,5,Mark,False,2,Not that.
1122,1122,5,Mark,False,5,"Hey, is that a kingfisher?"
1123,1123,5,Mark,True,17,"Ugh, films. Another hour of my life gone trying to explain to him what The Matrix is."
1124,1124,5,Mark,False,8,"Jeremy, you promised you'd play with apparent enthusiasm."
1125,1125,5,Mark,False,7,"Yes, it's very sophisticated. It's your move."
1126,1126,5,Mark,False,3,Because I'm winning?
1127,1127,5,Mark,False,5,What? What the hell for?
1128,1128,5,Mark,False,10,"No, Jez, if you drank my piss, I'd feel violated."
1129,1129,5,Mark,False,4,"I'm sorry, but no."
1130,1130,5,Mark,False,9,Why would you even want to drink my piss?
1131,1131,5,Mark,False,8,What the hell made you think of that?
1132,1132,5,Mark,False,5,"Well, thank you very much."
1133,1133,5,Mark,False,15,I don't want sweet punani action. I wanna take your bishop and grind you down.
1134,1134,5,Mark,True,18,"Oh, God, I wish I lived with the chess computer. The chess computer wouldn't make me do things."
1135,1135,5,Mark,False,15,"I don't want a hangover, Jeremy. I want to be almost asleep by eleven o'clock."
1136,1136,5,Mark,False,2,"Yards, really?"
1137,1137,5,Mark,False,4,"Oh, yeah. They're eating."
1138,1138,5,Mark,False,4,"No, let's definitely not."
1139,1139,5,Mark,False,7,"No, look, really, they're eating, we're drinking."
1140,1140,5,Mark,False,26,"Look, Jeremy, the whole world isn't Zoo magazine. Everyone isn't just walking around wanting it the whole time. People have a wide range of emotional states."
1141,1141,5,Mark,False,15,"Well, they might be feeling pensive or full of hubris, melancholic, amused, or just numb."
1142,1142,5,Mark,False,1,God!
1143,1143,5,Mark,False,3,I'm very sorry.
1144,1144,5,Mark,True,35,"Oh, God, this is awful. It's so obvious. We don't just want to chat, it's not just friendly. They know exactly what we're doing. And the horrible thing is, they don't even seem to mind."
1145,1145,5,Mark,True,9,"Come on, Mark, turn it on, play the game."
1146,1146,5,Mark,False,25,"Oh, naughty, you've combined metric and imperial. You might get an interdenominational, you know, from mixing the two measurement systems, a hangover of that kind."
1147,1147,5,Mark,True,12,"Just stay mute, Mark. You're a social freak. Remain in your compound."
1148,1148,5,Mark,False,7,"So, you've got a great canal boat."
1149,1149,5,Mark,False,14,"Right, the upkeep must be a nightmare. I mean, the mooring costs alone would..."
1150,1150,5,Mark,True,6,"Technically, a fiancée's not a girlfriend."
1151,1151,5,Mark,False,5,"Uh, you know, not really."
1152,1152,5,Mark,False,5,"Oh, right, and did he...?"
1153,1153,5,Mark,True,15,"Oh, God, vodka. It'll be an orgy. Great, disappoint three people instead of just one."
1154,1154,5,Mark,False,2,Nothing's happening.
1155,1155,5,Mark,False,16,"What, when he had sex with a prostitute and gave his wife that aggressive yeast infection?"
1156,1156,5,Mark,False,8,"I don't like her, I don't fancy her."
1157,1157,5,Mark,False,6,I just wanna go to bed.
1158,1158,5,Mark,False,5,I'm gonna go to bed.
1159,1159,5,Mark,False,25,"We are not in the Euro, Jeremy. So you can have your squalid little night. I'm gonna go and read Roy Jenkins on Winston Churchill."
1160,1160,5,Mark,True,30,"Dodged a bullet, there. Although, maybe not. My attraction to her is so minimal, for once, I might've been able to do it for hours. An endless, joyless fuck session."
1161,1161,5,Mark,True,35,"I'm not wearing them, they're Hitler's boots, I'm not wearing Hitler's boots. What the hell's going on? Why are we moving? Jeremy can't be up! Someone's trying to steal the boat! Pirates? I'm being shanghaied!"
1162,1162,5,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy, what the hell is going on?"
1163,1163,5,Mark,False,8,"Oh, this is a new one. Water stalking."
1164,1164,5,Mark,True,25,"Oh, great, I'm Scotty. He's off crossbreeding with the beautiful aliens, and I'm stuck down in the engine room with the probably cancer-emitting fuel cells."
1165,1165,5,Mark,False,5,"Uh, yes, that's my racket."
1166,1166,5,Mark,False,13,"God, you've got fingers in so many pies. How do you keep track?"
1167,1167,5,Mark,True,10,"I'm with the business elite, shitting on the little guy."
1168,1168,5,Mark,False,2,"Wow, brilliant."
1169,1169,5,Mark,False,6,"Oh, right, I'll have a think."
1170,1170,5,Mark,True,19,"Oh my God, India. Could be my way out. Goodbye Sophie, goodbye sexual humiliation, hello Corrigan the neo-colonial overlord."
1171,1171,5,Mark,False,11,I thought for a minute there you were gonna ask me.
1172,1172,5,Mark,False,3,"Not really, I'm-"
1173,1173,5,Mark,True,28,"Oh my God, I've entered an interview situation and there's a hand near my cock. This is like that dream I had about Alan Sugar and the badger."
1174,1174,5,Mark,False,7,I have experience of managing a team.
1175,1175,5,Mark,False,23,"Yes, but I've developed a portfolio of skills over the last three years which enable me to rise to new challenges with ease."
1176,1176,5,Mark,True,33,"Maybe this is a test. She can't actually fancy me. Or a trick. Maybe they're Johnson and Sophie wearing masks, and this is all being paid for by MTV and The Playboy Channel."
1177,1177,5,Mark,False,18,"And, in the last quarter at JLB, I personally presided over an increase of close to seventeen percent."
1178,1178,5,Mark,True,19,"Ugh, wealthy, lovely family. If only she wasn't such a horrible person, she'd be the woman of my dreams."
1179,1179,5,Mark,True,4,Does a marriage count?
1180,1180,5,Mark,False,18,"Nope, not that I can think of. Wherever I lay my hat, pending legal searches, that's my home."
1181,1181,5,Mark,False,2,"Oh, yeah."
1182,1182,5,Mark,True,9,I think she might have a borderline personality disorder.
1183,1183,5,Mark,False,4,I think she's lovely.
1184,1184,5,Mark,False,2,"OK, great."
1185,1185,5,Mark,True,22,"Maybe, instead of marrying Sophie, I should just marry Lucy. No, stop trying to marry everyone, Mark! No need to marry people!"
1186,1186,5,Mark,True,2,"Answerphone, yes!"
1187,1187,5,Mark,False,20,"Hey Soph, really sorry to have missed you. I'm having a great time on my stag. Bye! Let's speak soon!"
1188,1188,5,Mark,True,16,"Although, probably not, because I know when you're busy, and that's when I always ring you."
1189,1189,5,Mark,False,3,"Guess what, Jez?"
1190,1190,5,Mark,False,10,Malcolm's head-hunting for a co-manager of his Indian call centre.
1191,1191,5,Mark,False,28,"There's a chance, a slight but very definite chance, that I could be off to India. And you know what that means. Won't be able to get married."
1192,1192,5,Mark,False,15,Of course not! Sophie couldn't ask me to turn down the opportunity of a lifetime.
1193,1193,5,Mark,False,25,"Oh, no, there'd be visa issues, endless complications. No, I'm afraid to say, this could put a great deal of strain on the whole relationship."
1194,1194,5,Mark,False,26,He's nibbling but he hasn't bitten yet. So I'm just gonna get Gerrard to email through my CV and then wow him with a big pitch.
1195,1195,5,Mark,False,18,"Oh, Jez, don't look like that. You could always come. You could start again, find a new career."
1196,1196,5,Mark,False,12,"That could work. I'd be the Maharaja, you'd be my white concubine."
1197,1197,5,Mark,False,8,And maybe we can get one small servant.
1198,1198,5,Mark,True,31,"We'll need a servant. These leftovers are from two nights ago and he never empties the bin. Oh God, I bet it's bursting at the seams with used condoms and porn."
1199,1199,5,Mark,False,12,"Fuck! Ah! There's a... there's a dead beast in our bin, Jeremy!"
1200,1200,5,Mark,False,10,A dead dog in our bin! How has this happened?
1201,1201,5,Mark,False,7,"Well, why not? Jeremy, is this... Mummy!?"
1202,1202,5,Mark,False,16,"Oh, right, brilliant. You've killed Mummy. Well, what the hell is it doing in our bin?!"
1203,1203,5,Mark,False,14,"But, the bin, Jeremy! The bin's for household waste, not beloved pets, et cetera!"
1204,1204,5,Mark,False,15,"Oh, right, this is sort of like a disgusting version of The Great Egg Race."
1205,1205,5,Mark,False,6,"It's not great, Jez, that's why."
1206,1206,5,Mark,False,19,"Exactly. No, all things considered, my career prospects, your sexual desperation, this is probably the best thing to do."
1207,1207,5,Mark,False,12,"Yeah, as it turns out, dogs do seem to be mostly water."
1208,1208,5,Mark,False,13,"Well, put the legs back on in the middle, maybe it'll burn better."
1209,1209,5,Mark,False,9,"You shouldn't need firelighters to burn a dog, Jeremy."
1210,1210,5,Mark,False,12,"Look, I've got to get my pitch sorted before I see Malcolm."
1211,1211,5,Mark,False,2,What spade?
1212,1212,5,Mark,False,11,Do you think I'm some kind of freelance dog-murdering mafia man?
1213,1213,5,Mark,False,40,"Jeremy, there are many things I would do to help you, but digging a hole in the wintry earth with my bare hands so that you can bury the corpse of a dog you killed, is not one of them."
1214,1214,5,Mark,False,26,"And, as you can see, I've been in the top ten percentile of performers at JLB for the last three financial years in a row, so..."
1215,1215,5,Mark,True,4,"Shit, I'm losing him."
1216,1216,5,Mark,False,19,"And, if you look at the bottom, you'll see that my hobbies include history and going to the movies."
1217,1217,5,Mark,True,23,"Of course you do, everyone does. Man seeks woman, must be interested in film, breathing oxygen, and converting protein intake into muscle energy."
1218,1218,5,Mark,True,16,"Fucking hell! He's got Mummy! He's brought a dead dog into my pitch, the stupid bastard!"
1219,1219,5,Mark,False,23,"Uh, yes, as I was saying, I love cinema, especially the films of Spielberg, Lucas, and the man who did The Usual Suspects."
1220,1220,5,Mark,False,14,"Well, just keeping a handle on the purse strings, there. A-B-C, always be cost-cutting."
1221,1221,5,Mark,False,2,"No, thanks."
1222,1222,5,Mark,False,6,"No, Jeremy, it's not my turkey."
1223,1223,5,Mark,False,10,"I really don't feel like eating turkey, Jeremy. I'm full."
1224,1224,5,Mark,False,7,"Look, I'll email through my references, Malcolm."
1225,1225,5,Mark,True,14,Guess not fitting my CV onto one side of A4 is basically irrelevant now.
1226,1226,5,Mark,False,7,Did you actually have to eat it?
1227,1227,6,Mark,True,41,"OK, here we go, wedding day. I am heading for a wedding. How do I feel? Empty? Check. Scared? Check. Alone? Check. Just another ordinary day. Ha ha. Very funny. Oh, great, I didn't expect a freshly ironed shirt, but him?"
1228,1228,6,Mark,False,13,"Super Hans, it's my wedding day. I need to get into my bathroom."
1229,1229,6,Mark,False,6,"God, Jeremy, this place is disgusting."
1230,1230,6,Mark,False,11,"Yes, I'm so glad I didn't attend almost any of it."
1231,1231,6,Mark,False,6,"I believe so, what exactly is-"
1232,1232,6,Mark,False,14,"Right and who won, Gore Vidal or Dr. Jonathan Miller? Is that, Nancy stayed?"
1233,1233,6,Mark,False,4,"Shit, the last breakfast."
1234,1234,6,Mark,False,2,That's right.
1235,1235,6,Mark,False,6,A cream cracker and a Ryvita?
1236,1236,6,Mark,False,4,That's my wedding breakfast.
1237,1237,6,Mark,False,1,Really?
1238,1238,6,Mark,False,4,"That's very kind, Jez."
1239,1239,6,Mark,False,3,"Oh, right, OK."
1240,1240,6,Mark,False,6,"Yup, yeah, a very exciting day."
1241,1241,6,Mark,False,7,"No need to rub it in, Nance."
1242,1242,6,Mark,False,3,"Well, not really."
1243,1243,6,Mark,False,17,"Fine, no, I agree, it's great, it's massive. I'm really looking forward to it, all right, satisfied?"
1244,1244,6,Mark,False,10,"Jez, I need to have a look over your speech."
1245,1245,6,Mark,False,9,"The best man's speech, I need to fact-check it."
1246,1246,6,Mark,False,27,"I don't mind it being risqué, Jeremy. I just wanna make sure it's at least accurate. Also I will veto any jokes about mucus, vomit or excrement."
1247,1247,6,Mark,False,23,"Come on, Jez, I'm feeling very tense and nervous and unhappy and I think maybe worrying about your speech is the reason why."
1248,1248,6,Mark,False,8,"Yes, well, can I please just see it?"
1249,1249,6,Mark,False,1,What?
1250,1250,6,Mark,False,3,"Yes, you do."
1251,1251,6,Mark,False,20,"Look, Jez, it's my wedding day and you need to write a speech 'cause I am going to get married."
1252,1252,6,Mark,False,17,I don't like it. I don't like it at all. It sounds like I'm gonna attack her.
1253,1253,6,Mark,False,7,"No, Jez, it's blue, put something else."
1254,1254,6,Mark,False,15,"Pay? Jeremy, is that from the internet? Are you doing my speech from the internet?"
1255,1255,6,Mark,False,36,"Yes, that sounds perfect, now can we please get going? I've allowed us a generous four hours to get to the church, but I don't want to eat into our margin of safety by yakking here."
1256,1256,6,Mark,False,32,"Yes, good. You know, I actually find it quite comforting that our entire relationship can be reduced to an online speech template. I mean, Kenneth Halliwell and Joe Orton couldn't do that."
1257,1257,6,Mark,False,5,Is he gonna be OK?
1258,1258,6,Mark,False,12,"My shoe, my wedding shoe! First my hat and now my shoe."
1259,1259,6,Mark,False,8,"Jeremy, do not pull over, that's an order."
1260,1260,6,Mark,False,11,"You'll have to be sick in this, we're on a schedule."
1261,1261,6,Mark,False,10,"Jeremy, he's by my cummerbund. Pull over, pull over immediately!"
1262,1262,6,Mark,False,25,"Right, so me, hat and shoes. You, speech. Let Super Hans keep retching till he's chundering fresh air. Meet back in twenty minutes max, OK?"
1263,1263,6,Mark,False,2,"Well, yes."
1264,1264,6,Mark,False,3,Don't be ridiculous.
1265,1265,6,Mark,False,24,"Listen, Jeremy, just get yourself to an internet cafe to cut and paste some appropriate sentiments about me from the world wide web, OK?"
1266,1266,6,Mark,True,16,"I'm not marrying out of spite, I'm marrying out of fear. There's a very big difference."
1267,1267,6,Mark,True,46,"Oh, this is not how I imagined it, scrubbing my puke-stained wedding wear in a coffee shop toilet. Still, none of it's how I imagined it. Just wish I felt a tiny bit excited, not like I was marching to the Gulag for an undetermined crime."
1268,1268,6,Mark,True,25,"God, look at her. I would break my own fingers just to spend one night with her. Jenkins on Churchill, she is the perfect woman!"
1269,1269,6,Mark,False,9,Can I get a filter coffee to take away?
1270,1270,6,Mark,True,4,Might as well ask.
1271,1271,6,Mark,False,5,"Yes, will you marry me?"
1272,1272,6,Mark,False,10,"You probably don't want to, I just thought I'd check."
1273,1273,6,Mark,False,5,"OK, that's fine, no biggie."
1274,1274,6,Mark,True,109,"God, what's happening to me? Am I really gonna get married? Don't want to, but calling off the wedding at the last minute? Don't want to hurt lovely Sophie. Need time to think. How can I buy some time? Contract TB? But where from? No badgers. Try to get beaten up? I could say, he's got a fat head. Call him a jizz-cock? Not actually an insult, all cocks are jizz-cocks really. Be like calling him a piss-kidney. Road traffic accident? Yeah, that'd kick everything into touch for a few months. Shit, could I? Here it comes. Come on, Mark, take the hit. Keep your eyes on the prize."
1275,1275,6,Mark,False,5,"Sorry, I didn't see you."
1276,1276,6,Mark,True,3,Must get injured!
1277,1277,6,Mark,False,8,"Well, you should be more careful, you jizz-cock."
1278,1278,6,Mark,False,9,"You could have had my legs off, you piss-kidney."
1279,1279,6,Mark,True,8,"Arsehole, yep. Nice insult. Clean, clear and insulting."
1280,1280,6,Mark,False,25,"Yeah, yeah, fine, but bit of a wobble. I just proposed to a woman in a coffee shop and tried to get myself run over."
1281,1281,6,Mark,False,13,"I think... you're right. I shouldn't marry Sophie, I should call it off."
1282,1282,6,Mark,False,24,"Oh, no, God, no, no, it's not a jilting. I'm gonna tell her right away. A jilt is at the altar, I'm not jilting."
1283,1283,6,Mark,False,10,"Nope, at the altar. ""He jilted her at the altar."""
1284,1284,6,Mark,False,10,"Come on, we need to get Super Hans and go."
1285,1285,6,Mark,False,15,"Do you think we can leave him in that toilet, lying in his various liquids?"
1286,1286,6,Mark,False,22,"No one wanted to drop the bomb on Hiroshima, but in the end it probably saved more lives than if they hadn't."
1287,1287,6,Mark,False,4,"Jez, wrong way, mate."
1288,1288,6,Mark,False,3,That's not possible.
1289,1289,6,Mark,False,8,"Nancy? No Jez, I need to see Sophie."
1290,1290,6,Mark,False,22,"Oh, no. Cancelling the wedding on the day is one thing. Doing it over the phone, that's over the line. That's despicable."
1291,1291,6,Mark,False,7,"Jeremy, we are going to see Sophie."
1292,1292,6,Mark,False,8,"Look Jez, Nancy's bullshit, she doesn't love you."
1293,1293,6,Mark,False,17,"It is, I'm not gonna be known as Mark the jilter for the rest of my life."
1294,1294,6,Mark,False,4,"Jeremy, release the wheel."
1295,1295,6,Mark,False,2,Thank you.
1296,1296,6,Mark,False,8,"OK, sure, and I'm not a love rat."
1297,1297,6,Mark,False,6,"Still, good to clear the air."
1298,1298,6,Mark,False,3,"Lovely, clear air."
1299,1299,6,Mark,False,8,"So, here we are, the House of Pain."
1300,1300,6,Mark,False,11,"Brilliant, except of course, I am about to cancel the wedding."
1301,1301,6,Mark,False,18,"Oh, God, look at it, Jez. Look at all the wedding stuff. Everyone's getting ready for a wedding."
1302,1302,6,Mark,False,23,"Shit, Jez, I don't think I can do it. I don't think I have a good enough reason to call off this wedding."
1303,1303,6,Mark,False,1,What?
1304,1304,6,Mark,False,9,What is it? Did you get off with her?
1305,1305,6,Mark,False,6,"OK, I promise. Release the gold."
1306,1306,6,Mark,False,35,What? You're kidding! You're my best friend and you copped off with my fiancée? You lovely bastard! This is dynamite! This is the perfect excuse! Why the hell didn't you tell me about this earlier?
1307,1307,6,Mark,False,17,"I am angry, very angry, but also incredibly relieved. It's difficult to express both emotions at once."
1308,1308,6,Mark,False,19,"You're not just saying this? You wouldn't just make this up, would you? To try to keep me happy?"
1309,1309,6,Mark,False,17,"Oh, this is sweet. I am out of this, no questions asked. You shitty, faithless, backstabbing beauty."
1310,1310,6,Mark,False,4,"Hello, Penny. Where's Sophie?"
1311,1311,6,Mark,False,6,I just need to see her.
1312,1312,6,Mark,False,6,I need to see her immediately.
1313,1313,6,Mark,False,5,Something massive has come up.
1314,1314,6,Mark,False,5,You can't. Let me through.
1315,1315,6,Mark,False,19,"Sophie was unfaithful. She had an affair, with Jeremy. I need to talk to Sophie about the whole wedding."
1316,1316,6,Mark,False,19,"Well, in my eyes, I'm afraid she's been unfaithful. She broke a sacred bond, sort of like a... whore."
1317,1317,6,Mark,False,6,It was a breach of trust.
1318,1318,6,Mark,False,1,Nevertheless-
1319,1319,6,Mark,False,5,See you at the church.
1320,1320,6,Mark,False,18,"Why couldn't you at least have said you'd fucked her, eh? Would that have been so very hard?"
1321,1321,6,Mark,False,15,"How the hell has it come to this? This is wrong, this is terribly wrong."
1322,1322,6,Mark,False,43,"I don't know. I don't wanna end up on my own, like Miss Havisham, wanking into a flannel. But I do feel very strongly that it's not right. There are strong arguments on both sides. It's a moot point. This wedding is moot!"
1323,1323,6,Mark,False,5,"I just don't know, Jez."
1324,1324,6,Mark,False,2,"Shit, hide!"
1325,1325,6,Mark,False,42,"I need to think. I can't talk to the dad, Jeremy. I'm wrestling with the biggest fucking decision of my life and he's gonna wanna talk about buttonholes and the parking situation, which to be fair, is a bit of a nightmare."
1326,1326,6,Mark,False,6,"Forget it, Jez. Hold it in."
1327,1327,6,Mark,False,5,"OK, we're safe up here."
1328,1328,6,Mark,False,13,"No, of course not. I was just kneeling. Having a nice little kneel."
1329,1329,6,Mark,False,45,"Shit, there's Mum and Dad. Maybe I should, It would still be OK to go down there now, just, wouldn't it? I could say I was looking for God up here. It might not be bad to look like I've gone a tiny bit mad."
1330,1330,6,Mark,False,17,"Oh, my God. There she is. She looks so beautiful. How many missed calls have you got?"
1331,1331,6,Mark,False,29,"That's bullshit, I've got seventy-three. Right. Shit, I need to sort this. I mean, what am I gonna do? What's gonna happen here? 'Cause personally, I have no idea."
1332,1332,6,Mark,False,27,Do you know what? I think I might toss a coin. I think tossing a coin might be the best available route open to me right now.
1333,1333,6,Mark,False,40,"Why not? I don't seem to have any other ideas. OK so, heads, I marry, lifetime of potential grinding resentment. Tails, I stay here, become a social outcast and turn my back on the woman I may very well love."
1334,1334,6,Mark,False,13,"I'm kind of excited too, so... Urgh, it's marry. I'm gonna marry, shit."
1335,1335,6,Mark,False,9,"Yes, exactly, best of three. Oh, heads again, shit."
1336,1336,6,Mark,False,5,"No, the coin has spoken."
1337,1337,6,Mark,False,5,"No, I'm not getting married."
1338,1338,6,Mark,False,35,"Well, the coin isn't actually the boss of me, Jeremy. And how I felt when it told me to marry makes me think I definitely shouldn't. So, text everyone, text everyone to tell them that."
1339,1339,6,Mark,False,79,"Yup, tell them, tell them I'm doing a Stephen Fry. We're in Brussels. I'm eating chips and mayonnaise. I'm on the edge. You found a blanket under the garage door and I'm wearing an overcoat and no one should approach me. And I'll be back in a couple of weeks and everything's fine. Maybe we'll have a wedding in a couple of weeks. But I'm on the edge, stress that. Everyone needs to be kind to me. Text that."
1340,1340,6,Mark,False,4,I'll cover the cost.
1341,1341,6,Mark,False,10,"Well I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, is there?"
1342,1342,6,Mark,False,11,Prayer bucket? There's no such thing as- that's just a bucket.
1343,1343,6,Mark,False,6,"No, no, no, you can't move."
1344,1344,6,Mark,False,14,"If you really can't hold it in, then you'll just have to piss yourself."
1345,1345,6,Mark,False,8,"Yes, if you've got to go, piss yourself."
1346,1346,6,Mark,False,5,"Yes, and do it quietly."
1347,1347,6,Mark,False,5,Are you doing it already?
1348,1348,6,Mark,False,5,When are you gonna stop?
1349,1349,6,Mark,False,9,"Stop, Jeremy. Stop it, it's going down the cracks."
1350,1350,6,Mark,False,1,Stop!
1351,1351,6,Mark,False,5,I'm ordering you to stop!
1352,1352,6,Mark,False,22,"Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit! Oh, my God! This has gotta be a dream. Nothing this bad could ever happen in reality."
1353,1353,6,Mark,True,8,What am I gonna do? Throw myself off?
1354,1354,6,Mark,False,12,"Surprise! Hello, it's me. Look, I've surprised you. What a brilliant joke."
1355,1355,6,Mark,False,12,"Of course, of course I want to do this, this is great."
1356,1356,6,Mark,False,21,"I wasn't hiding, Sophie. It was a stag thing and it really, really worked. Everyone was so surprised, especially you. Brilliant."
1357,1357,6,Mark,True,7,"Oh please, someone, save me! Jeremy? Spacemen?"
1358,1358,6,Mark,True,40,"He's ladling it on now. Is that the proper thing? He hasn't just put that in to needle me, has he? Oh, great, now she's crying and I probably look like a wife beater. It's not fair! I'm unhappy too."
1359,1359,6,Mark,True,21,"Hortensia? Oh, this is a fucking disaster. Look at me, I'm one of those men women read about in their magazines."
1360,1360,6,Mark,False,3,I- I will.
1361,1361,6,Mark,True,18,"That's it, I've ruined it. I've ruined my life. You only get one life and I've ruined mine."
1362,1362,6,Mark,True,5,Please don't say I will.
1363,1363,6,Mark,True,1,Ugh!
1364,1364,6,Mark,True,23,"Tears of joy, they're tears of joy. That's the line we both stick to, now and for the rest of our miserable lives."
1365,1365,6,Mark,True,25,"So, I've done it, I'm married. If only New Labour hadn't abolished the tax advantages, I'd have something positive to cling on to right now."
1366,1366,6,Mark,False,13,"Ow, look, you could really- some of it's going on Sophie, guys, please!"
1367,1367,6,Mark,False,9,"Thanks. Thanks, Jez. I'll see you at the reception."
1368,1368,6,Mark,False,11,"Well, that was... that was one to tell our grandchildren about."
1369,1369,6,Mark,True,4,"Oh, God, more crying."
1370,1370,6,Mark,False,18,"Oh come on, Sophie. You're worried about the caterers, aren't you? Not everyone will go for the tuna."
1371,1371,6,Mark,False,11,"Don't say that, Sophs. It's done now. We're over the hump."
1372,1372,6,Mark,False,19,"It's not that easy, Soph. That was the Church of England marriage service, not applying for a Nectar card."
1373,1373,6,Mark,True,28,"That's it, I'm alone. Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up in my bed alone. Unless, I hire a prostitute, just for the night? Kind of like a wedding present."
1374,1374,6,Mark,False,7,"Me? Yeah, good. No, feeling pretty good."
1375,1375,6,Mark,False,13,"That'd be nice. You know, you do smell really quite strongly of piss."
1376,1376,6,Mark,False,7,"So, what now? Back to the flat?"
1377,1377,6,Mark,False,7,"So, Nancy, did she not show up?"
1378,1378,6,Mark,False,14,"Well, I suppose I should apologise for not letting you go and get her."
1379,1379,6,Mark,False,5,"Oh, that's nice. Thanks, man."
1380,1380,6,Mark,False,6,"Exactly, stick it on the bill."
