9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, Mark, I know what you're getting at, but the fact is, that day with Dobby I had a... a medical brain attack. I've got a note from the doctor, somewhere. If I could find the bloody thing.",Kitchen

9,1,Molly,Jeremy,"Jeremy, is it true?",Super Hans' Flat

9,1,Jeremy,Molly,Because he took it off me.,Super Hans' Flat

9,1,Mark,Johnson,"Uh, no?",Met City Bank
9,1,Johnson,Mark,"I got something up on my visual display unit this morning, Mark. I thought it was a high-definition photo of some dog shit. Then I took a closer look, and I realised it was actually your sales record.",Met City Bank

9,1,Jeremy,Mark,Mark?,Met City Bank
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I felt a bit bad about the other night, so I got you a biscuit. I mean, they call them cookies, but I know you prefer me to call it a biscuit.",Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Uh-huh. The good thing is that to get, say, three thousand pounds, you'd pay just twenty-one percent APR.",Met City Bank
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,Is that good?,Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"It's pretty good, yeah. And you'd only need to repay two percent of the capital a month.",Met City Bank

9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Three grand, free?",Met City Bank

9,1,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Met City Bank
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So basically, it is free, really.",Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, you've winkled me out. It is basically free. And the interesting thing about you is that you'd actually qualify as an F6.",Met City Bank
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,That sounds good.,Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,It's a credit rating especially for people like you.,Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Mark,The terminally ill and criminals who might flee to Thailand.,Met City Bank
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Ooh, I've got a credit rating.",Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, you have, Jez. You have. And to qualify for this loan, all you need is a reference from a landlord or a former landlord.",Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Mark,Would you like to play capitalism?,Met City Bank
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Great. And now I'm all signed up, could we have a chat about living arrangements? Yeah, I've moved out of Hans'. So yeah, I'm considering something really exciting, a night in one of the Royal Parks. Unless...",Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Mark,"Homeless Jeremy. No, harden the heart, I'm moving on.",Met City Bank
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, Jez, you wouldn't want to live with me and Jerry. We're stick-in-the-muds who like nothing better than watching Civilisation with Kenneth Clark whilst eating artichokes and sea bream.",Met City Bank

9,1,Mark,Jerry,"Um, yeah, brilliant.",Living Room
9,1,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, more William Morris. Wallpaper and workers' rights. God, this is like the Dark Ages. Centuries and centuries with nothing to look forward to except the slim possibility a Viking might break down the door and rape me.",Living Room
9,1,Mark,Mark,"Crush, crush the candy. So relentless, so satisfying yet unsatisfying. Like Cleopatra, Candy Crush makes hungry where most she satisfies. Crushing candy, quoting Shakespeare, hiding in a toilet of my own home. This is the confused high point of Western civilisation.",Bathroom
9,1,Jerry,Mark,"Are you OK in there, Mark?",Bathroom
9,1,Mark,Jerry,"Oh, fine, thanks, Jerry. Shouldn't be too much longer now.",Bathroom
9,1,Jerry,Mark,"Take your time, mate, I've paused it.",Bathroom

9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Quite like to get back to my reading, so...",Kitchen

9,1,Mark,Mark,"Fucking Facebook! Zuckerberg's fucked me again, that arsehole.",Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.,Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,I don't think you know your settings very well. You're pumping out invites every time you play.,Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,Perhaps I was hacked.,Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,That happens a lot.,Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,It could.,Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Mm, it just tends to happen to people who have just sent pictures of their cock on Twitter. They're all hacked.",Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, I can't think of any other explanation.",Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, the problem for you is I'm your friend. I know you, Mark. I know you like to pretend that you're this stuffed shirt who reads incredibly boring books about dead people killing each other with bayonets and typhoid, but I know the truth. I've watched Grand Designs with you. That smile when some eco-glass gets delayed on its way from Antwerp and the nice couple gets pushed over budget. That's the real you.",Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Mark,"It wasn't Antwerp, it was Freiburg.",Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"You're this pathetic human who likes Twirls and Downton and Bond and burgers, so don't come the big guy with me, because it won't fucking wash.",Kitchen

9,1,Jerry,Jeremy,"Well, if you are going to stick around, you might want to get a book out.",Living Room
9,1,Jeremy,Jerry,"Yeah, well, I haven't got Mr. Nice with me.",Living Room
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,You're reading Mr. Nice again?,Living Room
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"There's a hell of a lot to it. And when I read it I'm usually extremely high, which makes it better, but also means that I've forgotten most of it, which is actually great because then it never gets boring.",Living Room
9,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Come on, nerd, raise the drawbridge. King Jeremy's coming back to his castle.",Living Room
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,Lovely and warm in here.,Living Room

9,1,Mark,Jerry,"Right, who wants a nice cup of the Kenco?",Living Room
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Jerry said he doesn't want coffee. He said he'd make his own later. He said, like he was joking, that your coffee tastes like horse piss. But I don't think he was really joking.",Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Try a bit harder, Jeremy.",Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,And then he hit me.,Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,He did not hit you.,Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, Mark, you need to face facts. Jerry's a wanker. Kick him out and kick me back in.",Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,No.,Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,Why not?,Kitchen
9,1,Mark,Jeremy,No reason.,Kitchen
9,1,Jeremy,Mark,Is this the Dobby thing?,Kitchen

Shit, I don't really know either of their names. There's Dobby. She doesn't like pasanda and quality TV drama. She likes hitchhiking and terrifying actual drama. We don't fit.

It's been a long road and now, as you've found Molly, er, and I don't really want to get into this, but I've started it now, but I'm going to bring it round, so don't worry. People said Molly wasn't right for you. That she was a downer. But you know what? If someone loves someone, he just loves them. And if that person is considered to be a downer, or even a yawn-a-thon, who cares? And even if someone loves another man, or, what's in a name? Or gender? Is it possible to love two people at once? Three? Four is surely the limit. But is it? What is love anyway? Is it, er, an act, or a feeling or, who am I to speak? Who are you to listen? Why is a marriage a marriage? But society says it's wrong for two men to love one another even though now it says it says that now it's OK? Is it OK because society says it's OK? What next? Dogs getting married? Could I marry my own son? No. Possibly not? Correct. Or is it? What I'm trying to say is that people should do whatever they want to do, at a temperature that suits them, within limits.

9,5,Mark,Jeremy,April. It's gotta be April.,Kid Kave
9,5,Jeremy,Mark,Exactly.,Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Me and Sophie and Ian, it was a crazy scheme. It would probably do him so much harm, living between warring parents.",Kid Kave

9,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Only downside is, the snake escaped.",Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Kid Kave
9,5,Jeremy,Mark,I can't believe it would do that. So sneaky.,Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah. Who could believe a snake would be so duplicitous? They're so famously reliable, snakes.",Kid Kave
9,5,Jeremy,Mark,"The good news is, I googled it and it's totally not venomous.",Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Mark,So reassuring.,Kid Kave
9,5,Jeremy,Mark,What are you doing?,Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Jeremy,"It's Ian. I can't find him anywhere. So many bloody kids. I need to somehow get them all cleared out. Maybe shout ""fire"" or I could tell the staff that you were a famous paedo. That would clear the place like Jaws at the beach.",Kid Kave
9,5,Jeremy,Mark,A famous paedo?,Kid Kave
9,5,Mark,Jeremy,"What? You're very famous and easy about labels. You don't mind a bit of a ""bad boy"" rep. I need to talk to Sophie.",Kid Kave

9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Good, because I told Joe I'll be thirty-nine tomorrow.",Kitchen
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Why?,Kitchen
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't know. Forty is basically fifty, and fifty is dead. Whereas thirty-nine is like thirty-five. Thirty-five is practically thirty. Thirty is twenty. You know?",Kitchen

9,6,April,Mark,"Well, no, you just ran round the corner after me.",Outside
9,6,Mark,April,"No, right, I mean, I just... look, could we grab a coffee for five minutes? I've got a couple of things I need to say.",Outside
9,6,Mark,Mark,Got the coffee. Disregard the price. The price of the coffee is irrelevant.,Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,"Thanks, Mark.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,"No biggie. I mean, God knows how they can charge so much. They're certainly not spending it on lampshades.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Hello, dad. You're living inside me now, are you?",Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,"Yeah, so the flight's at midnight, to Athens. The ferry leaves tomorrow. All the islands, except Corfu.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,"Oh, not Corfu. Why not Corfu?",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,He asked innocently.,Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,Cause that's where Angus had his affair.,Coffee Shop

9,6,April,Mark,It's fine.,Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,"Anyway, what I wanted to say, just before you go, and if you want me to stop, just say, but yeah, I basically think that you're just so funny, and clever, and brilliant, and I really am sorry if that makes things difficult, but I think it's only fair that you should know that I think we'd be great together. I mean, I know I'm not perfect. In fact, I'm not even probably average. I'm a misshapen potato, an oddball.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Feel free to disagree, April.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,"I'm mean-spirited and I only really like hearing about other people's holidays when they've been disastrous. But I really, really like you. In fact, in all honesty, I... I love you.",Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,"Look. It was really weird, the last time we saw each other. You burying your wife in a pit of balls.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,"Ex-wife and more hiding than burying, but point taken.",Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,The truth is I- I do have feelings.,Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,Feelings!,Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,"And it's not all been easy with Angus. Just had a mini-row because he didn't want to spend an extra three hundred pounds on cabin with a porthole. If you're gonna be on a boat for three months, you want a porthole.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,Of course you do. Who wouldn't?,Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Three hundred quid pissed straight out the porthole? Correct call, Angus.",Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,Wow. OK. Wow.,Coffee Shop

9,6,April,Mark,"It's Angus. He's been ""having a think"" and he's not sure we should go on this cruise.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,April,"Oh, oh right.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,Furrow the brow. Furrow the brow to hide the smile.,Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,"Apparently now he wants to go to Ibiza, alone.",Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,Alone?,Coffee Shop
9,6,April,Mark,See you. Do what the fuck you want. Goodbye.,Coffee Shop
9,6,Mark,Mark,I've won. It's like I'm Napoleon invading Moscow and the Tsar's fucked off to Ibiza! I've conquered the whole of Russia! I've only gone and won.,Coffee Shop
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark. How's it going, you lovely rotter?",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Everything's coming up roses. April and I just had an overpriced coffee and did it in the toilets.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Excellent.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"April loves doing it in toilets. In fact, a hundred percent of the times we've done it, we've done it in toilets. I can't wait to do it in the bed.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,It'll be amazing.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"But the big news is that Angus texted to say that he's fucked off to Ibiza, of all places, leaving the coast clear for me to go off with his wife on, the cruise. Me and April, April and me!",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Man, that is so great. I am really happy for you. You deserve that.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I just wanted to say I know things have been a bit difficult between us over the last day or so, what with the punching and the blanking, but you're a good friend, although I still haven't totally forgiven you, mate.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I wouldn't have expected you to, mate.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Eh! Eh!,Hall

9,6,Super Hans,Angus,Shut it!,Jez's Room
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,What the fuck have you done?,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I know it's my birthday, not yours, but I got you a lovely present, to say sorry. For making you lose your job, and never paying you any rent, and for falling in love with Dobby, for everything.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Mark,Fuck. Angus.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Angus,"Jesus. Angus, are you OK?",Hall
9,6,Angus,Mark,It's fine. I wanted to come.,Jez's Room
9,6,Angus,Super Hans,Could I possibly get a glass of water?,Jez's Room
9,6,Super Hans,Angus,Yeah.,Jez's Room
9,6,Angus,Mark,They said they were gonna chop my penis off and put it into another orifice.,Jez's Room
9,6,Jeremy,Angus,"Oh Angus, shush. Bants, mad bants!",Hall
9,6,Angus,Mark,"They said they had a sock with a rock in it. They made me drink urine, Mark, human urine.",Jez's Room
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,He greedily gulped from a bedside bottle that happened to be from the golden source.,Hall
9,6,Angus,Mark,"Let me go, Mark. Will you let me go please?",Jez's Room
9,6,Mark,Angus,"Angus, you must know I had nothing to do with this.",Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Angus,"Here you go, you naughty monkey. Drink it nicely this time, not gulpy.",Jez's Room
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Did you send the texts?,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Yes. I was worried Ibiza was too much. Was it too much?,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"What the fuck have you done, Jeremy?",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,I've done a good one. I've cleared the coast. The coast is clear.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,The coast is not clear. We're all going to prison. You've gone totally loopy. You kidnapped Angus!,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Or, did I invite an unstable oddball for a lift in Hans' van, then back to here for a snifter, then he accidentally got locked in my room for a few hours? It's our word against his.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,This is bad. This is really bad.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,This is brilliant and it totally worked. You're back with April.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, until she finds out. I mean, what's the long term plan?",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,The long term plan is sucky fucky.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Sucky fucky is not a long term plan!,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, how long's the cruise for? Months. Chuck her phone off the boat first day. Butter fingers. Then work on her, cement things. You're in pole position.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Hmm, she does hate her phone.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Exactly.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,I think we let him go and I take the hit.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, Mark. Sail off into the sunset and let your love butler take care of business.",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Fuck it! All right. Leave him in there for now.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Correct decision. There's always a dark side of love. Someone's always gonna get a little bit kidnapped. Who's that?,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,Oh. Er... surprise!,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh for fuck's sake, Mark! I told you I didn't want a fucking surprise party!",Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,I thought you were just hiding your true feelings.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,When have I ever hidden my true feelings?,Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,History man's getting a bit wriggly. I think he needs restringing.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Give him a poke.,Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,I'm not giving him a poke. I'm not a fucking hired goon. Who's on shift?,Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Mark,Mark?,Hall
9,6,Mark,Super Hans,I'm not doing a shift. This is insane.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Relax. Everything's gonna be fine. You're the British people. We're Blair and Bush. We'll do the rendition. You just have a glass of wine and pretend nothing's happening.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"All right, gag him, Hans.",Jez's Room
9,6,Mark,April,April?,Hall
9,6,Mark,Mark,Tell her we're leaving.,Hall

9,6,Mark,Megan,Come on in. Thanks for coming. Put that in the fridge if you want.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,Why did you invite her? She hates me. I stole her boyfriend.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Sorry, but when I was doing the invites, it became clear that you've betrayed everyone you've ever been close to. I think that's why the majority declined.",Hall
9,6,Molly,Jeremy,"Hi, Jeremy.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Molly,"Oh hi, Molly.",Hall
9,6,Molly,Jeremy,Happy birthday. I guess that's what you're meant to say.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Molly,Go on through.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I wouldn't say we were scraping the barrel, but well, you've just not been great at keeping in touch.",Hall
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,"Hey, Jez. You look tired.",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,"Yeah, well, I'm definitely not.",Hall
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,So I got you a present.,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,Tickets?,Hall

9,6,Jeremy,Joe,"Stay up for a week. Oh right. So what, no sleeping at all?",Hall

9,6,Joe,Jeremy,But you said you were thirty-eight turning thirty-nine.,Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,"Did I? Yeah, maybe. I forget. Yeah, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, in that area.",Living Room
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,"You definitely said you were turning thirty-nine, the big three-nine.",Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,It's not a big deal. Whatever.,Living Room
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,"So, why lie?",Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,I didn't. I just misspoke.,Living Room
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,"It's fine. It's just, it's weird that you wouldn't think it's fine.",Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,"Look, Joe, I'm sorry, but the truth is I'm forty, and I don't want to go raving for a week. I want to stay up till about one and then go to bed and listen to my Mr. Nice audiobook.",Living Room
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,Bed at one? One isn't even the night.,Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,"It is, Joe. Look, I can't rave all day and fuck all night. And honestly, I don't even like drinking my own piss.",Living Room
9,6,Joe,Jeremy,You drink your own piss?,Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Joe,"Yes. I eat cashews and I drink my own piss and it doesn't work. I'm never gonna be young, dumb, and full of cum ever again and that's that.",Living Room

9,6,Mark,Mark,Here goes. Quick speech and then cruise.,Living Room
9,6,Mark,Others,"Jeremy, what can I say? A man I know very well indeed.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Mark,That's probably as far as I can truthfully go on the endearment stakes.,Living Room
9,6,Mark,Others,"Um, he's not a great man. He's not a wise man. He's not always a good man.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Mark,"OK, where am I going?",Living Room

9,6,Others,Jeremy,Speech. Speech.,Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Um, thanks, Mark.",Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Others,"We're quite a gang obviously, us two. Brains and the funny one. The old stick up his arse, boring jumper one, and the sexy, pep up the party, acid in the punch bowl one.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Mark,He loves triggering mental illness.,Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Others,"But we get on pretty well. I mean, we have our ups and downs like any couple.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Hold on. If Hans is here, who's with the hostage? Oh God, I've got an unattended hostage!",Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Others,"...and a boring bastard sometimes, but at the end of the day, we've lived together for shit long and it's been... all right.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh fuck, got to keep the attention.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Others,"Yeah, and if I could just say one more thing. Um, Jeremy, Jez, please always keep on being you.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Mark,Totally meaningless. I'm going to get rumbled.,Living Room

9,6,Angus,April,He said he was gonna cut my willy off and put it into my bottom.,Hall

9,6,Molly,Super Hans,Simon?,Hall
9,6,April,Mark,"What's going on, Mark?",Hall
9,6,Jeremy,April,This has nothing to do with Mark or Hans. It's all my doing.,Hall
9,6,April,Jeremy,It's all your doing?,Hall
9,6,Jeremy,April,"Angus wanted stuff done to him. I wasn't into it. It's all pretty disgusting. I don't want to go into details, but it's complicated. We'll probably never fully understand, like Stonehenge.",Hall
9,6,Angus,April,Mark knew. Mark saw it all. They got me outside the travel agency.,Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Molly,Molly. For fuck's sake.,Hall
9,6,Mark,Mark,Who could have possibly predicted that falsely imprisoning a love rival would turn out so badly? Only a genius.,Hall
9,6,Mark,April,"April, don't go!",Hall
9,6,Mark,Mark,"A real night to remember, like the Titanic.",Hall
9,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Right, well, it's over with Molly. Apparently I'm not even allowed to do a little fucking naughty kidnap. So bollocks to it. I'm gonna van it to Macedonia. Finally set up the moped rental.",Living Room

9,6,Mark,Jeremy,"What next? Bring back smallpox? We all had fun with the smallpox, didn't we? Is it time smallpox had a reboot?",Living Room
9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, will you pull me off?",Living Room

9,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Sure, whatever. I just thought it might be comforting.",Living Room
9,6,Mark,Jeremy,What about I read to you from Napoleon's correspondence?,Living Room
