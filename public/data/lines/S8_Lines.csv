8,1,Jeremy,Super Hans,Cheers man.,Jez's Room
8,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Not the bag, never Hans' bag.",Jez's Room
8,1,Super Hans,Mark,"And Mark, just so you know, guys at the showroom are looking for more hands on deck. Money's tasty, and you get to work with toilets which is obviously funny. And showers, which are sexy.",Jez's Room

8,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Why didn't I get the job tip? We could have been the Chemical Toilet Brothers.,Jez's Room
8,1,Mark,Mark,"So great that Dobby's agreed to move in. Just got to close the deal. Get her into the flat, and get her locked down like Fritzl. No, not like Fritzl. Like a nice, normal, loving guy who knows where she is at all times. Which at no point would be locked in the cellar.",Dobby's Flat
8,1,Mark,Dobby,Good time at Gerrard's last night?,Dobby's Flat

8,1,Dobby,Mark,He's not in a great way. Poor guy can barely move.,Dobby's Flat

8,1,Mark,Mark,I bet some parts of him can move very well.,Dobby's Flat
8,1,Mark,Dobby,"Looks like I've got a job interview lined up, bathroom supplies. Incredibly flat management structure, which is cool.",Dobby's Flat

8,1,Mark,Mark,"I've got a tin-opener, why is she buying a new tin-opener? Fuck, she's not gonna move in. This is no pound shop-tin opener. This is a luxury tin-opener! She's gonna use this to open her single tins, and then somehow get the sexual satisfaction from it I so obviously can't give her.",Dobby's Flat
8,1,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, uh, Dobs, just because I need to do a form, when do you think you might be moving in?",Dobby's Flat

8,1,Mark,Dobby,"Ah, cool.",Dobby's Flat
8,1,Mark,Mark,"The getting together of the shit. Could take a night, could take five years.",Dobby's Flat
8,1,Dobby,Mark,"Shit, nuke this, will ya?",Dobby's Flat
8,1,Mark,Mark,"Need more information. The tin opener isn't conclusive. Could ask her straight how she feels. Ha ha ha. Yeah, right. What if I broke the microwave? Test case, if she buys a new one, then I'll know she's never moving in. Hmm, can I? Yeah. Maybe a good old waggle in there. Take that, mechanism! You weren't built for the screwdriver, were you? You don't like that in there, do you? Ha ha. No macaroni for us tonight. Sorry, microwave.",Dobby's Flat
8,1,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, Dobs, it looks like your bloody microwave's bust or something. Still, I've got one at mine, so...",Dobby's Flat

8,1,Gerrard,Dobby,"Hi Dobs, thanks for coming over.",Gerrard's Place

8,1,Gerrard,Dobby,"Oh, I feel awful.",Gerrard's Place

8,1,Dobby,Gerrard,"Where's your inhaler, G man?",Gerrard's Place
8,1,Gerrard,Dobby,"Maybe in the spare room? Ken took the last of his stuff. It feels funny to be all alone. To be honest, if I could just find a pal, I'd ask then to move in rent free.",Gerrard's Place
8,1,Gerrard,Mark,"Don't worry, Mark, I'll take good care of her. Very, very good care indeed.",Gerrard's Place

8,1,Mark,Jeff,"Don't think so, mate.",Hall
8,1,Mark,Mark,"Maybe Ian won't remember I gave him away to another man. If he does, he'll be some kind of memory genius. ""Yeah, my son hates me, but he can remember a full deck of cards, and that's why he lives in Vegas.""",Hall
8,1,Jeremy,Mark,Jeff?,Hall
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,I think it's OK. Or do you think there's any chance he's trying to kill all my offspring? Like Herod?,Hall

8,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, stocking up.",Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Right. It's just, Dobby might well have moved in before we eat all these horrible lentils.",Kitchen
8,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, I've just got the feeling maybe I'm gonna get to finish these lentils.",Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,"She is moving in, you know? I'm getting a firm date. Why have you got cat food?",Kitchen
8,1,Jeremy,Mark,"To confuse them. Fucking Nectar inspectors. That's why I got the denture cleaner, to throw them a weird one. ""Who are these guys?""",Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Great, so now they'll think we're a couple of guys with our booze, and our pizzas, and a cat we starve, and an old man we've kidnapped whose dentures we periodically deign to cleanse.",Kitchen

8,1,Dobby,Mark,Hey.,Kitchen

8,1,Jeremy,Mark,It is a good plan.,Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,I know.,Kitchen
8,1,Dobby,Jeremy,"Listen, my mate Alice is seeing a shit-hot therapist. He's sorted her right out. Work, relationships, her OCD about visiting every mainland Holland & Barrett, everything.",Kitchen
8,1,Jeremy,Dobby,"God, I'd love to do therapy. Get someone's hands in my brain, have a root around. I just can't afford it.",Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,"You know what, Jez? If you like, I could pay for you to have therapy.",Kitchen
8,1,Jeremy,Dobby,"It's not with electric, is it?",Kitchen
8,1,Dobby,Jeremy,"No. He's really amazing, and it's only five hundred for an intensive course.",Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,Why don't I give you that? Your deposit? Since you're moving on.,Kitchen
8,1,Jeremy,Mark,Really? Are you sure? What about the stain?,Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,It's a goodbye gift. Fuck the stain.,Kitchen
8,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Dude, I thought you were going to wheedle me for ages about the stain.",Kitchen

8,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I like you, too, Jez.",Kitchen
8,1,Dobby,Mark,It's Gerrard.,Kitchen

8,1,Dobby,Mark,I could be there and back in three quarters of an hour. He might have got worse.,Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Dobby,It looks like there's someone on The Apprentice who I think we're both going to really loathe. A real specimen.,Kitchen

8,1,Mark,Dobby,"Look Dobs, sometimes you need to draw a line.",Kitchen
8,1,Dobby,Mark,Whoa! You manhandled my phone. That's pretty Fifty Shades of fucking Grey.,Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Dobby,You know you wanted me to.,Kitchen
8,1,Dobby,Mark,"Right. Well, this bloke better be a solid gold twat.",Kitchen
8,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Right. Therapy. What do I really want from therapy? A harsh, unremitting stare at the bare facts of my actual life. Oh, fuck that, he's eating a Twix! I can't take him seriously.",Therapist's
8,1,Others,Jeremy,Mr. Usbourne?,Therapist's
8,1,Jeremy,Others,"Sorry, I'm Mr. Smith, wrong house, I'm not coming back, goodbye.",Therapist's

8,1,Mark,Mark,Interview advice from the disordered mind of the crackhead.,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Mark,Super Hans,Right.,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah. You should be like, ""no mate, let me stop you there. This interview's gone on long enough. I need a shit, and a glass of water. I'll be back in five."" Then march out, stroll around the block, back in, he'll love all that.","Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Mark,Super Hans,A shit and a glass of water?,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"

8,1,Mark,Mark,"Wow, I can't believe I got a second interview! If I can only remember my own name at the next one, I might be in with a chance. Hang on, this is prime therapy time. Oh, I get it, the lady doth eat bhaji too much, methinks. I've seen behind the curtain. Ahoy there, moral high ground. He's wasting fice hundred of my pounds, and it feels fantastic.",Outside
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Hi, Jez, how was your session?",Living Room
8,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, good. Yeah, amazing. Reckon I'll be cured soon.",Living Room
8,1,Mark,Jeremy,Cured? Did they use that phrase?,Living Room

8,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Me and Doctor Bhaji.,Living Room

8,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Ooh, he's gone over the edge there.",Kitchen
8,1,Mark,Mark,"Jesus. Life. Spinning past. Every second, every single fleeting moment till we're gone. I'm taking a look at my phone tariff. I've got a very strong feeling I'm being fucked in the arse.",Kitchen

8,1,Grayson,Mark,"Oh, Mark, come on in. OK, so, for the second stage, we thought we'd take a different approach. A joint interview. Test your group decision making, and personnel skills. Good?","Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Mark,Grayson,Great. Survival of the slickest.,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Grayson,Mark,Exactly. So you should all have had time to look at the task.,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Others,Grayson,"Yeah, it's a great task. But I think we should really try and think outside the box on this one.","Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Mark,Mark,Just leave that to hang like the bad fart it is.,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Mark,Others,"If I may, perhaps we should pool our skill sets by subdividing into working groups. How about you guys look at the logo, and web strategy, while Hugh has a think about the rebrand?","Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Others,Mark,OK.,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Mark,Mark,Fucking my rival with the dildo of the impossible rebrand.,"Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"

8,1,Mark,Mark,"He said self-effacingly, as he definitely secured the job.","Baths, Bathrooms and Fittings"
8,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Hmm, he looks OK. Wonder what's wrong with him? Mistook his wife for a hat? Mistook his hat for a Child Called ""It""?",Therapist's
8,1,Others,Jeremy,Mr. Bendicks will be with you in five minutes.,Therapist's
8,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Mr. Bendicks, is that a joke? Maybe it's a test. If you tell him that his name makes you think of bendy dicks, he knows that you need the electric? Relax, just take it quick, and easy. Whip through a couple of my issues.",Therapist's
8,1,Mark,Dobby,"Hey, hey hey, this place is great! What a find!",Church

8,1,Mark,Mark,"God, I feel so upbeat!",Church
8,1,Dobby,Mark,"Yeah, well he was a nice guy.",Church
8,1,Mark,Mark,This is a mega funeral. It was a mega interview. Hugh was the only real rival. But look what's happened to Gerrard. This is what I do to rivals. I put my rivals in the ground.,Church
8,1,Johnson,Others,"Hi guys. My first memory of this great little guy in the big old box here, was when Gerrard's cheeky little face poked round my door at JLB. He was sniffing around for a raise that, given what I don't think anyone will mind me saying, were his very limited attributes was bloody outrageous! Look, nothing can make today all right. But maybe we can take some comfort from the brutal reality that the weak must make way for the strong. Evolution marches on, the scythe is remorseless. I hope the scythe's remorseless swing can bring some comfort to you all. OK.",Church
8,1,Others,Johnson,"Thank you very much, Alan, for those inspiring, yet challenging words.",Church

8,2,Jeremy,Mark,They're asking you to pay?,Living Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"It's a totally standard deal, for first time authors. But, the poor guys, I'm absolutely killing them on the big unit deals.",Living Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Does J.K. Rowling pay to have Harry Potter books published?,Living Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"That's different. Harry Potter books are about wizards, for children. My book is about pharaohs, for adults.",Living Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Right. OK.,Living Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"In fact, it was the unluckiest day of J.K. Rowling's life when she got picked up by a publishing house. Greg, from British London, was saying ""imagine if she'd self-published!""",Living Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,British London? Doesn't that sound a bit...,Living Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,Too patriotic for your liking?,Living Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Made up?,Living Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"So what if it's made up? Do you think Penguin was founded by a penguin? In a sense, everything's made up.",Living Room
8,2,Super Hans,Mark,I don't like the way these percentiles are looking at me.,Living Room
8,2,Mark,Super Hans,"Right, well, thanks for that, Hans, but I really wouldn't worry. It's a gentleman's agreement.",Living Room
8,2,Super Hans,Mark,It looks like you've agreed these gentlemen can arse-fuck ya.,Living Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Just, um, be careful, OK, mate?",Living Room
8,2,Mark,Mark,Jeremy is the voice of reason and Super Hans is giving me legal advice. Doesn't feel great.,Living Room
8,2,Dobby,Mark,I went around to see Trish and Simon and everyone in the new office.,Cafe
8,2,Mark,Mark,No doubt their office is a converted warehouse full of smoothie makers and basketball hoops and rim jobs.,Cafe
8,2,Dobby,Mark,"I was like, fuck it! Why not? So I handed in my notice at the council yesterday!",Cafe
8,2,Mark,Dobby,Oh... wow... that's... amazing.,Cafe
8,2,Dobby,Mark,I know!,Cafe
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you failed. She's done exactly what she wanted.",Cafe
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"I tried, but it's difficult. Spirit crushing comes much more naturally to you.",Cafe
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,This won't work. You should have told her the truth. Dreams crumble to dust.,Cafe
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Your motto? You should put that on your business cards. Anyway, chill out. If you love something, set it free.",Cafe
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, what if I love a black mamba? Should I set that free? Is that what you and Sting want? A venomous killer loose on the streets of South London?",Cafe
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"So, thinking about the book launch. Cash bar, but I might provide nuts. Salted, or dry roasted though? Salted, a classic, everyone loves salt, but expensive in the quantities I want to provide. It's tricky.",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Aren't London British paying?,Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"British London. No, not in the current climate. OK, time to hit go. Make the transfer. Let BL fire up the printing press.",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Mark! Two thousand pounds?!,Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"The situation in Denmark is deteriorating! That's a fact! Ink shortage! But if I move quickly, BL might be able to get me some. They have a guy in Hamburg!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh my God, he's actually going through with it! He's cracking his nest egg and frying it up to make these arseholes a delicious breakfast.",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,Hey!,Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, I can't let you do this.",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Return my mouse, Jeremy! That's my property! You're censoring me! I'm calling amnesty!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Go ahead, I'm sure they'd be fascinated but the mouse is staying with me. I'm doing an intervention on you.",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"All you're doing is preventing an important work of world literature from going to press! Why don't you intervene on Ian McEwan, or Tony Parsons?",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm gonna say two words that you don't want to hear, ""vanity publishing"".",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"You're just jealous because I'm a successful author, and you're an unemployed dope smoker who even after twenty years of doing it, still can't roll very good joints!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"I just think you need to be realistic about your targets, aims and expectations.",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,Are you trying to life-coach me?,Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,Maybe.,Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm the one who should be doing an intervention. On you! Because, my friend, you are a vanity life coach!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"My course is a proper qualification! It's not a pretend book from a pretend publishers, getting printed on pretend paper!",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, well, even if you complete your ludicrously short course, you're never going to be a life coach. It's just another dream, like being a pop star, or a front bottom inspector!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"That wasn't a career, that was a T-shirt!",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, well, a front bottom inspector is still a more realistic career option for you, than life coach!",Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Mark,"I threw that T-shirt out months ago! You know why? Because it was tasteless. I was embarrassed to wear it in public. That's the Jeremy you're dealing with now, that's how much I've grown as an individual.",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Hey, Jeremy, do you wanna life coach this into the washing up bowl?",Mark's Room
8,2,Mark,Mark,You're not stopping my book launch. Kneel before Pharaoh Corrigan and his pyramid of peanuts.,Mark's Room
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,"So, uh, listen, what the hell's going on?",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Celia,Jeremy,How do you mean?,Life Coaching Class
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,"Everyone... everyone passed. Is it some sort of administrative error? I mean, Hilary, whose UKIP membership card fell out of her purse, are you really suggesting people go to her to get coaching? Is my certificate different? Is it better?",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Celia,Jeremy,You don't have a certificate.,Life Coaching Class
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,"What do I get? A couch? Or... a conch? Or a cro- not a crown, that would be odd.",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Celia,Jeremy,I can't put my reputation on the line by certifying you as a life coach.,Life Coaching Class
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,What?,Life Coaching Class
8,2,Celia,Jeremy,"You have a poorly developed ego system, and... sexual issues.",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,"Oh, yeah? OK. Well, let me give you a little tip about foreplay. You were waggling around on my guy like it was the cranking handle on Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang.",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Celia,Jeremy,"You're a sexual pervert, Jeremy.",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,"Do you mean, in a bad way? 'Cause of what I said?",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Celia,Jeremy,Yes. It was disgusting.,Life Coaching Class
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,"Oh, ""Mrs. Severed Cocks"" thinks I'm disgusting!",Life Coaching Class
8,2,Celia,Jeremy,Cut all my hair off and eat it?,Life Coaching Class
8,2,Jeremy,Celia,"I was busking, I was vibing, you were cutting things off, I thought... hair! I mean, it's not cocks!",Life Coaching Class

8,2,Mark,Jeremy,"No, uh, it's gonna be a good night, I reckon. Yeah? So, Jez, listen, I'm just gonna go home out the fire escape or the window, but would you ask the pub man if I can have my deposit back, and would you tell everyone I've made a horrible mistake? Goodbye.",Pub Function Room

8,2,Mark,Others,"Ahem. Hi. Ahem. Hi, everyone. Thanks... thanks for coming. Um, I- I just wanted to say, vanity, all is vanity. Like Pharaoh Khufu, I have built a great tomb. But, tonight, I'm not gonna bury you in it with me. Except with the admittedly generous mounds of peanuts that you'll see I've provided. No, tonight I just want to say that this book is a disaster! It's a travesty! It's proof of a broken promise. But, I want to announce here that I will be aggressively pursuing British London in the small claims court. Therefore proving the wisdom of my seventh chapter, ""Make UK company law into your Anubis."" Or, as the BL spell check has rendered it, ""Make UK Company Law Your Omnibus.""",Pub Function Room

8,2,Mark,Greg,"Not that it's any of your beeswax, but I was thinking about doing something on Napoleon and the internet.",British London
8,2,Greg,Mark,"Now that sounds amazing. How about that, and a second run of BS of the Ps. Correct the errata, no up front payment, you would just put in a small bridging loan.",British London

8,3,Neil,Mark,Are they a band?,Cottage
8,3,Mark,Neil,Of course they're a band.,Cottage
8,3,Neil,Mark,"OK, clue, they're warm, very warm. Nation's favourite food.",Cottage

8,3,Mark,Neil,T'Pau.,Cottage

8,3,Neil,Mark,Hot Chip.,Cottage
8,3,Mark,Neil,"Ah, yeah, OK. I thought it might be Hot Chips.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Round one to you, Simon. Next time we do a quiz, it'll be on Napoleon, and while you might scrape through a few Waterloo questions, when I pin you down on the emperor's domestic reforms, I will fuck you very hard in the mouth.",Cottage
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,"When I woke up, Dobby was already having a coffee and a joint with Simon.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,They found some dope?,Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Jeremy,"My dope. I drove to Brighton at seven thirty to buy some. Half an ounce of hash for a blim of approval. God, I hate myself.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Super Hans,"You shouldn't hate yourself, man.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Stop life coaching him, Jeremy.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,I'm not.,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,"Hey, guys.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"At last, military strategy. You're on my turf, music geeks.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"All right, Neil?",Paintballing
8,3,Neil,Jeremy,No. I've left thirty-six messages for Alice.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Neil,"Great. Well, that's clearly all part of your particular process, so well done. That's all normal and good.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Possibly.,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,We sorted out the teams. You're reds.,Paintballing
8,3,Trish,Mark,It's ten minutes to scatter. Then let the death hunt commence.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Trish,Death hunt?,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Mmm, the death hunt. That sounds relaxing and fun.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Mark,"Sorry, Mark, I'm yellow. Look out for the grenades.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Dobby,Grenades? Can we have some grenades?,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,This is private stash.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Simon,We want one of those. I'm happy to pay.,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,Pay? Who you gonna pay?,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Simon,"I don't know, the... men.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,"There aren't any men here, dude. It's just us.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,No men? Not even a man?,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,We're going off-road.,Paintballing
8,3,Trish,Mark,There's no rules. Just take out every member of the opposite team to win.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"By that, she means me.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,Death hunt!,Paintballing
8,3,Others,Mark,Death hunt!,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Dobby,"Dobs, this isn't fair. Look at us.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Others,"Yellow team, move out.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,Holding hands? That's not military. I'm pretty sure Rommel never held hands.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Why does there have to be a death hunt, Mark? Why does war even exist? Why can't we all just have a game of footie like how England beat Germany for the first world war?",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know how to answer that, Jeremy.",Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,Hmm.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Ah, this is a paintballing nightmare. Must escape, must not die. Enjoy the relaxing game. Keep girlfriend from ex sex.",Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Others,"We're coming to paint you, shitheads!",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Ah, yes, a ditch. I should burrow further and further into the earth like the worm that I am.",Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Mark, it's me.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Hans?,Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,I think I've just spotted some kind of bunker.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Brilliant.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Wonder if Simon found a bunker. I wonder if he's in there with Dobby. Oh, God.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Probably. War makes people horny. Yalta. Yalta was hardcore. Stalin and Roosevelt sandwich. Churchill sat on the side, wanking. Yeah?",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,Can we hide with you?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,We're not hiding. We're in a holding pattern.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Hmm, the lifeboat is getting overcrowded.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Mark,Hi.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Deena,Hi.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Yes, it's more the merrier in the lifeboat. You can't have too many people in a lifeboat. That's what they never, ever, ever fucking say.",Bunker
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Is this allowed? Just run away from the war?,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,The action of the sane man through the ages.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,They were forming a kill squad 'cause of Alice. Kill squad. That's not a nice squad.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Don't sweat it. Alice is a doom-monger. Long term, Neil's gonna be very happy he chucked her.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"That was my hunch, 'cause, you know, well, I'm bound by strict confidentiality, but I think it's OK to tell you because you know him a bit. Neil likes to get handcuffed and then pulled off with gloves on.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Does he?,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Yeah. This is all confidential, and I wouldn't be telling you unless it was interesting. That would be unprofessional, but she wouldn't wear the gloves even at Christmas.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Bloody hell.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Can you keep a secret?,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,I don't know.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,He sucked a guy off at college and thinks he might want to do it again.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Wow, OK. What about the football coaching thing?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Yeah.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,What was the football coaching thing? There was something about his job. He really liked his job or something.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"I really think I've said enough, to be honest.",Paintballing
8,3,Others,Jeremy,"Hey, gaylord, you gonna bum the lesbo?",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Others,What's that?,Paintballing
8,3,Others,Dobby,Lesbo.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Others,"Yeah? Eat this, motherfucker.",Paintballing
8,3,Others,Dobby,Fuck's sake.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Others,"And if I was gay, why would I want to bum her? That doesn't even make sense. Taste my logic gun, bitch man.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"God, this is so frightening and boring, just like a real war. Cowering in a foxhole for months. I could've got this sensation of anxiety and fear at home by drinking three cafetieres of coffee and then lying under my bed and calling my dad after ten PM.",Bunker
8,3,Trish,Simon,They went this way. Scour the area.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Charlie,"Guys, look, they're onto you. There are too many of us here.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Deena,"All right, what about this? Matches. Two longies, two shorties. Pick.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Super Hans,OK.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Deena,"Short, you're going, sorry.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Super Hans,Shit.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,Mate. Long. Mark.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, one short, one long.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Short, congratulations.",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,But-,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,"Yeah, first short goes, first long goes, and the last one is long, so I'm good. Bad luck, guys.",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,Is that right?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,"Yeah, yeah, of course it's right-",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"innit, Mark?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Mm, a bit horrible, but-",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Charlie,"That's right, sorry.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Charlie,"Hey, we don't make the rules.",Bunker
8,3,Charlie,Super Hans,"Well, you did make the rules.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Charlie,I think that you might be OK.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,You won't be OK.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Deena,Yeah?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Deena,"Listen up, Hall and Oates, you're going for a little walk, and you may be some time.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Fuck, it worked. Maybe I should use the matches to get Jeremy to move out. Long, he leaves, short, he leaves.",Bunker
8,3,Deena,Trish,"Ow, fuck.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Jesus, they're painting those poor bastards like the Forth Bridge.",Bunker
8,3,Trish,Simon,"All right, bunker cleared. Moving on.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Thank God.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, they're lucky they didn't get hit by the snitch.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,The snitch?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Golden snitch. Apparently, the yellows like to mix it up a bit, chuck a ball bearing in the paintball pot to make things interesting.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,A ball bearing? But that would- that'd kill you!,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"No, no. I mean, it would go in you.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,It'd go in you?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, it'd go in you a bit, wouldn't it? From one of those guns. A fucking ball bearing?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Oh, God.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Splat an eyeball, take out your windpipe. Take a nut off like that. You'll be all right, unless you get hit in a sensitive area.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"But I'm covered in sensitive areas. I can't see a single part of me that I would nominate to be smashed with a high-velocity ball bearing. Hans, I'm really sorry, but I think I need to do a poo.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"You're not pooing in the bunker, Mark.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,You had a wee.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, a little bit of wee compared to a great big poo? You're not pooing in this bunker. If you poo in the bunker, I will shoot you.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Could keep it in. But then, what if I get into a combat situation and my valves go floppy?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Oh, for God's sake.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"The charge of the shit brigade. Uh, force ten poo from Navarone. I thought humanity had evolved beyond this. This is a really fun weekend. Could it be any worse? Maybe. If Dobby and Simon came round the corner humping and then shot me with my pants down. Started this war as Napoleon, but I'm reduced to wiping my bum with his biography. Although I am able to pick a section I've already read. Plus, it's not like Napoleon is wiping his bum with pages of my biography, so I am, to an extent, maybe, winning.",Bunker
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Simon. Wants to know if I'll join him in his bunker for a party.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Yeah, Hitler put the bad vibe on the bunker party, like he did with so much else.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"I really shouldn't be talking to you about this, should I?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"It's cool. I am a professional life coach, remember. Everything you say will be strictly confidential.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"What's Mark like, to live with?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Well, I hate living with him, but I never want it to end. Why is that? Is it like the Stockholm syndrome where you want to go and live in Stockholm with a dick or something?",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,That is quite a long wait. Is he a secret paedo or something?,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"No, obviously, no.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,She's asking for it. She's begging for... a life coaching.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,How are you feeling about moving in with him?,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Well, you know Mark. He's brilliant. Sour and funny and cynical and anxious and screwed up.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Keep going.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"But sometimes, I wonder, is he enough fun?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Right, yeah.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Fun means good at sex. Everyone knows that. Basic life coaching.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,Drugs. He'll probably start hallucinating I'm a yellow. Or a sexy female hostage.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"I'm going Ewok, mate. Full-on fucking furball. I've got hairy ears poking out me noggin.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Maybe not too much more speed?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"They think I'm a drugged-up scumbag. They're all the same, the yellows. The empire, we're 22-carat Ewok.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,Right?,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"We should get one of them in here, take a knife to him.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,You don't mean a real knife. You mean a paint knife.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"That's a paintbrush, Mark. I'm just talking Swiss army. Cut one up. What do you say to that?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"I say, let's definitely not do that.",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Forget the knife. Let's get one of them down on the floor, yeah? Strip him, paint his arsehole from point blank range. What do you say?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"I'd say you've moved from attempted murder to violent sexual assault. Which is probably, technically moving in the, quote, right direction. How about we just surrender? Make my boxers into a makeshift white flag, march into their bunker with my boxers on a stick and say, ""What the hell's going on here?""",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Still living the boxer short dream, Mark, eh? You need to get some ball support before your nuts start dragging like iron eggs in a pair of Grayson Perry's tights.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Mm, locked in with a mad commanding officer. Only problem is, if I shoot him, he won't actually die.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Do you think Simon is really getting it on with Dobs in the bunker, or is it just me being paranoid?",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"No, mate, of course you're not. Yellows, fucking yellow bellies. Yellow fever! Boning your bird? Classic yellow.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,Probably not the most reliable spirit level to test my paranoia against.,Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Seriously, I've had it up to here with the yellows' shit. If you want to belt up and bust out, Mark, I am in.",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Well then, as Napoleon once said-",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Hmm, what's a goodie?",Bunker
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"""Laws which are consistent in theory often prove chaotic in practice.""",Bunker
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,Fuck yeah.,Bunker
8,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, he's gonna kill someone, with paint. I might've inspired a paint war crime.",Bunker
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"I think the truth is, basically, I've been bored ever since 9/11.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Yeah?,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"I mean, I was watching the news with Mark the other day, and he was like, all up in my grill about the Euro. And I was like, ""Ooh, the Italians might leave the Euro, big wow."" It's not exactly planes smashing into buildings, is it?",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Yeah, that was good news. Not good news, obviously, but ""good"" news.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"It was amazing news. You know, in terms of events and consequences, it was just huge news.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,Maybe I've been bored since 9/11.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"They set their standards too high with 9/11, the news.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,They can't top it.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Exactly.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I love you. Holy fuck, where did that come from?",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Simon again. Last year, he was all, ""It's just not working."" Now I'm with Mark, he's all, ""Ooh, I forgot what nice calves you have"", ""Let me put my dobbin in your noggin.""",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,Right.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Get your dobbin out of her noggin. There's a queue here. Mark, me, dead Gerrard, then you at the very back of the queue.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Jez, are you OK?",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just thinking about... how weird it is that things, and also people, er, can sometimes be... di- different.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Yeah, I'd love to agree, but you're spouting gibberish. Come on, let's rejoin the troops before we get Court-martialled.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This is bad. I've done a lot of bad shit, but falling in love with her is the worst, or at least the most recent, bad thing I've ever done.",Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,The yellow bastard's gonna be in there right now doing your missus. We need to get in there.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"OK, OK, let's think this through. How about we outflank, and try a Napoleonic ""manoeuvre de derriere"", eh?",Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,I'm gonna give them an art lesson. I'm gonna Jackson Pollock these motherfuckers.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Super Hans,"Yeah, or-",Paintballing

8,3,Mark,Mark,"Right, into the bunker to save Eva Braun and cockblock the führer.",Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Simon,Where's Dobby? I thought Dobby was in here.,Paintballing
8,3,Simon,Mark,Been trying to get her to come in to talk some sense into Neil.,Paintballing
8,3,Mark,Mark,"No humping, brilliant. So, just gotta get her to stay faithful for another forty years when we have very little basic compatibility.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Yeah, screw Simon. I'll just move in with Mark and give it a go.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Great, and if it doesn't work out, just move in with me. Ha! Just joking, just a stupid joke about something that wouldn't happen.",Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"That would never work, Jeremy. We're too similar.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,I know.,Paintballing
8,3,Dobby,Jeremy,We'd never get out of bed.,Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Cause we'd be doing it, and doing it, and doing it, and then have a doobie, and then do it, and watch TV, and then maybe we'd have dinner, and just fuck the world, and that would be our whole thing.",Paintballing
8,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Easy, Romeo. Lay off the doing it.",Paintballing
8,3,Super Hans,Mark,"Argh! Argh, I've got the snitch! I've taken the fucking snitch up the jacksie! This is bullshit, Mark. I want revenge.",Paintballing

8,4,Dobby,Mark,Do it when we get back. We're not emigrating to the moon.,Outside

8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I just think now's the time for a big statement. Show her how I really feel. I'm going to pop the question in the Quantocks on the weekend. Dobby's driving. She's stopping off to see Gerrard's sister and her depressing laundry outlet in Reading.,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"The Quantocks? Where you accidentally proposed to Sophie? Is that where you have to ask women to marry you, by law?",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, do you think it's a good plan? Show her how I feel?",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, honestly...",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,This is the moment. Got to tell him the truth. Tell him I love Dobby. Grasp the nettle and get stung to fuck and face the firing squad and get shot to bloody pieces.,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, good plan.",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Thanks, Jez. Good to talk it through with a mate. Ah!",Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Ah!,Jez's Room
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Didn't grasp the nettle, obviously. Who would grasp a fucking nettle?",Jez's Room
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"It's very good of you to help me, Jez, but it's not the 1830s. I, I think I'll survive the terrifying train experience.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Got to tell him I love Dobby. That's the honourable way. Tell him, then tell Dobby. Dobby will say she needs to think about it. but I'll be able to tell she really does love me, probably. And we buy Mark a cake and all have a right old laugh?",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, well, er, thanks. See you Monday.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Hope everything goes well.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Thanks, mate.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,Got to say it. Got to say something.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"The train's gonna leave, Jeremy.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. So, apologies, but I think you should know I'm in love with Dobby.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm sorry, what the fucking hell are you talking about?",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I thought it was only fair for you to know. Goodbye. Sorry, can I just get past?",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Before my best friend kills me with a tuna baguette. Oh, my fucking God, this train is running on time. This is unprecedented. Oh, no. Oh, fuck! Oh, back to the scene of the crime to face the music and dance, like some mad musical murderer. How the hell am I gonna play this? Just going to totally fucking ignore it. It never happened.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So, I'm back. Oh, look, an interview with the new USA national football coach, Jürgen Klinsmann.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What in the name of holy fuck is going on?,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, I'm really, really sorry but Dobby... I mean, she's just so lovely.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I know she's lovely. That, sadly, appears to be one thing that we agree on.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I feel terrible. I do. I've been carrying around this weight for months.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, you thought it was about time to drop it on my head?",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You don't understand, Mark. I'm in love with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. The love tap is gushing.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, turn it off.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I can't. I've tried.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, try harder. Put some fucking elbow grease into it.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"How am I supposed to do that when there's no such thing as elbow grease? Look, Mark, I knew how much this would hurt you, how angry you'd be. That's why I planned to tell you and then get off the train right afterwards.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,How incredibly noble.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"God, this is so stressful. I feel terrible.",Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Others,"Tickets, please.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I don't suppose you'd lend me some money for a drink? Bit of lager?,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I am the very last person on this train who would lend you money, Jeremy. Currently, the very thing that would solve all my problems is you dying of thirst.",Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Jeremy,"Tickets, please.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,"Yeah, I wasn't meant to be here. I was just helping him with his luggage.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Not by request.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,And then the doors closed. I- I've come on the train by mistake.,Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Jeremy,"Standard single, that's, er, £34.60.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, would you mind?",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, I would mind.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, for God's sake, it's thirty quid, I'll pay you back.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,"Look, I'm sorry about this, but this is really between you two rather than me. I mean, we're friends, we live together.",Train
8,6,Mark,Ticket Inspector,"No, we don't.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,We're on a weird one. He's got the money. Ask him why he won't pay.,Train
8,6,Mark,Ticket Inspector,The situation is perfectly simple. There's a passenger without a ticket who refuses to pay for one. You should remove him from the train.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,She can't throw me off a moving train in the middle of nowhere! What if I walk on the tracks? I might die.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Here's a tip, Jeremy. Don't walk on the tracks.",Train
8,6,Ticket Inspector,Jeremy,I'm going to have to ask you to leave the train at the next station.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Ticket Inspector,"Great with me, that's where we're going.",Train
8,6,Mark,Ticket Inspector,That's your punishment of last recourse? Free travel?,Train
8,6,Mark,Mark,Probably off to get him a complimentary fare-dodger's colouring book.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I can't believe you're actually thinking of coming.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I need to tell Dobby. I told you, like an honourable man.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,An honourable man would have become a monk or chopped his nuts off or gone to Morocco and become a paedo or a charity worker.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"That's as may be, but by my own code of ethics...",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Incredibly shitty ethics.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"...I think I've done the right thing. So, now, I'm going to come with you and tell Dobby how I feel. I mean, you've got to admit, me and Dobby are a better fit than you. We click.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I haven't heard any clicking.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, the clicking is continuous! That's why you haven't noticed it. Click, click, click, click, click, click.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, me and Dobby make a great team. Opposites attract.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, they don't. Not really. That's just something that scientists and people in horrible relationships say. I mean, be honest, the things you always moan about Dobby. I mean, you know, the DJ bars, the dope smoking, the poorly arranged finances. Don't they remind you of someone?",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I told you all those quibbles in a different era. You can't use them against me now in this kangaroo court of love.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Me and Dobby don't quibble.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Because you never spend any time together!,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, I'm really, really serious, Mark. I can't see a way out of this. I think maybe... like... like one of us should kill ourselves.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"The life coach speaks! Maybe the reason you think you're in love with Dobby is that she's the woman you've been spending most time with recently. If you'd spent the same amount of time with, I don't know, her, then you might fall in love with her instead.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Do you think I'm some kind of sex duckling who'll follow anyone around who's got breasts and a vagina?,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,No.,Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I love Dobby, Mark! And I know it's true love because I'm prepared to sacrifice my closest friendship for it. I'm gonna tell her.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I think we need a cooling-off period. Just go back to London, find out what Nancy's up to, watch some pornos, have a couple of gay flings and then, at the end of two weeks, if you still feel the same, then maybe you can say something.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"By which time, you've got her all married like a trussed-up hog.",Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"If you agree to hold off, then I could perhaps promise not to ask Dobby to marry me for a couple of weeks.",Train
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,OK. Deal?,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Deal.,Train
8,6,Mark,Mark,Two weeks to find the nicest ring for under two hundred pounds.,Train
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, mate. Next one to London's at 12:14. See you later.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. Actually, thinking about it, I don't know if I am gonna go back. Hi.",Train Station
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What the fuck? That was the agreement.,Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I know. I've just got this quite strong feeling you're gonna break the agreement and propose.,Train Station
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I just said I wouldn't.,Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, I know. The thing is, I don't trust you.",Train Station
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What if I say you can't?,Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"If you say that, I might be forced to say something too.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Hey, Dobs.",Train Station
8,6,Dobby,Jeremy,"Hey, Jez.",Train Station
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Er, yeah, I just thought it might be nice if Jeremy joined us for the weekend. Hope you don't mind.",Train Station
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Oh, no, that's totally fine.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Don't mind me. I'll just be hanging out, staying close to my buddy here.",Train Station
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Cause we look after each other. You watch my back, I watch yours. Isn't that right, dude?",Train Station
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"What's going on, Mark?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"I'm really sorry, but I had to bring him. It turns out there's something I need to tell you about Jeremy. I should have told you a long time ago but there's a reason why he's such a dickhead.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Yeah?,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"It's ironic with the life coaching, but it turns out he's a drug addict.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,I won't be long! I'll be very quick!,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Right, OK.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Also, he can't get an erection unless he thinks about something... disgusting. I don't want to say what. Plus, he thinks he might be gay. He's eighty percent certain.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Eighty, nice. No need to overdo it.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"So he's dealing with that, which I think is great, and I'm being very supportive over.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"I always thought he might be a bit gay, but more like thirty percent, if I'm honest.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"He's incredibly unstable. So, it was either bring him along or risk getting home to find him, you know. Yeah.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Right, it's just... our special weekend away?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,Change the subject.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"One sugar, Jez?",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, please.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,I gave him one without sugar the other day and he got really angry with himself and smashed up a CD case and tried to eat the pieces.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,He'd better not have bloody said anything or there will be repercussions. Extremely romantic repercussions.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,So did I miss anything?,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Jeremy,I had half a Scotch egg.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,Brilliant.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,"I need a wee too, but I will continue resisting. My bladder is not so easily the master of me, young Jedi.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Pie, Mark?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"No, I'm fine, thanks, Dobs, but I'll cut you a slice.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"He doesn't want any delicious pie? Normally, he loves pie. Suspicious. Very suspicious. He did spend a long time in the kitchen preparing the picnic. Of course! A ring! He's smuggled the bloody engagement ring into the pie!",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Sorry, Dobs, just need to check something.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,What the hell are you doing?,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm wise to you, my fine feathered friend.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,He's gone mad. Now to stigmatise the mentally ill.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Apologies. All good. Great picnic, though, Dobs.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Yeah, it's just a shame Jeremy put too many olives in the salad.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, I bloody didn't.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Dobby doesn't like olives. If you knew her better, you'd know that.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Jeremy,I don't mind them so much these days.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"Yes, you do, you hate them.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, so now you're calling Dobby a liar? That's charming!",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, I'm not, I'm saying she's hiding the truth to be nice. There's a very big difference.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,"Look, I really don't mind about the olives. See? Mmm! Olives! Lovely, greasy, bitter, horrible olives!",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I told you.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,She was being sarcastic. Can't you tell?,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Simon,"Hi, Simon.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, Simon.",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Simon,"Yeah, about thirteen olives.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,What part of ex-boyfriend doesn't he understand?,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Simon,"No, I'm just on a picnic. I'll spit these olives out, hang on.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,This is horrible.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well why don't you go back to London, then?",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, so you can ask her to marry you?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,That's what we agreed.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Fuck the agreement.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, great, that's brilliant. Fuck the agreement. Fuck the Geneva Convention. Fuck Parliamentary democracy. Fuck everything. Is that your great new idea?",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You know how weak my powers of self-control are. Normally I can't wait five minutes before having a wank or a spliff or a chocolate biscuit. I've restrained myself for nearly three hours. That's got to stand for something. I'm sorry, but I'm going to tell Dobby how I feel about her.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK. Well, in that case, I'm going to ask her to marry me.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, you're fucking not!",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, I fucking am.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,You can't ask someone to marry you without a ring.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, shit, you got me! Except, no, you totally haven't, you dickwad. Of course you can.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You can't propose, it's against the agreement.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"The agreement's already broken, because you already broke it!",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, fuck you!",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,Dobby!,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jeremy!",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,Dobby!,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,What the hell are you doing? That fence is electrified like a motherfucker.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jeremy.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,I know what you're thinking.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, really?",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Is this about the bloody olives?,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,"No, Dobby. It's about something else.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,Argh!,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Jeremy,What the hell did you do that for?,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,"Because, Dobby, there's something I need to say to..",Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Mark,Will you two stop electrocuting each other?,Quantocks
8,6,Dobby,Simon,"Hi, Simon.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,What's a step up from electric? A nice big stick.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, we're allowed sticks now, are we? It's come down to sticks. Is that what it's come down to?",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"As a matter of fact, it has.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, how about rocks? Are rocks invited to the party?",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Come on, then. Rock me, Amadeus. You know you want to.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, you'd love that, wouldn't you? ""Dobby, the bad man threw a rock at me.""",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, if you don't throw that rock at me, I'm going to hit you with this stick. Those are the available options.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh my God, she's gone. Where's she gone?",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, good one. Distract me, then crush my skull. I'm not falling for that one, old friend.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Dobby,Dobby? Dobby!,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,Fucking hell!,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Shit.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,See? She's gone. You've driven her off. Happy now?,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,Ow!,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"You were asking for that, Jez. Don't tell me you weren't, because you know you were! Dobby!",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,Please be Dobby.,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, fuck.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,She's flying to New York tonight with Simon. She's... she's taking the job.,Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"""Was hoping this weekend would be a chance to make up after all the weirdness."" She means you spying on her. You've fucked it, you idiot.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Mark,"No, I bloody haven't.",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"""But clearly the fact that you brought J, Jeremy, proves that you can't handle intimacy."" You fucked it, not me.",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Hang on, why does it say here that I'm eighty percent gay?",Quantocks
8,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Argh! Argh! I'll kill you, Jeremy, for trying to steal Dobby and electrocuting me and destroying my fucking pie!",Quantocks
8,6,Jeremy,Dobby,Dobby!,Quantocks
