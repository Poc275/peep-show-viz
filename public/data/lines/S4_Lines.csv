4,1,Sophie,Mark,Do you mind?,Department Store
4,1,Mark,Sophie,"No, sure, of course not.",Department Store

4,1,Sophie,Mark,"So, what are you going to wear for my birthday?",Department Store

4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Sixty million, that's more than Stalin, isn't it?",Department Store
4,1,Mark,Sophie,"It's not a competition, Soph. Although if it was, Mao would probably win.",Department Store
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, these are nice. Try these on.",Department Store
4,1,Mark,Sophie,This is just a zip. There's no pocket to this zip.,Department Store
4,1,Sophie,Mark,So?,Department Store
4,1,Mark,Mark,"That's the way things are these days. Let's just put a zip here, a swastika there, why not? Who knows what these things were once used for. Who the hell even cares?",Department Store
4,1,Jeremy,Super Hans,But what's Blair going to do?,Living Room
4,1,Super Hans,Jeremy,Maybe he'll become an ethical porn star.,Living Room
4,1,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Ha. Or a super group? Blair on guitar, Bono on vocals, Clinton on sax?",Living Room
4,1,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah, that is definitely gonna happen. Geldof's gonna shit.",Living Room
4,1,Mark,Super Hans,"Hi, guys, Super Hans.",Living Room

4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Just take it off. We'll talk about why after you've taken it off.,Living Room
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,What's wrong with us wearing the same clothes? Are you embarrassed that we're-,Living Room
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"No, not that. Just, we're clashing!",Living Room
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"We're not clashing, we're matching. That's the opposite of clashing.",Living Room
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"It's exactly the fucking same as clashing, all right? Just take it off.",Living Room
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"No, it's new. I'm wearing it in.",Living Room
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"All right, fine. If you're taking this down to the wire, fine. I blink, you win, OK? Jesus.",Living Room

4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I picked up ""Music Of The Royal Tournament"" for only £2.99 Pretty tasty.",Living Room
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Or are you just gonna bury your doubts until they erupt as a massive stroke and I have to carry you around on my back for thirty years?,Living Room
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I know I might have mentioned some doubts, but that was pub talk. You can't bring up pub talk in the cold light of day. You know how I get after the pub, like when I ordered the Abdominizer. Besides, she's good for me, Jez, she's dragging me into the 21st century, with its meaningless logos and ironic veneration of tyrants. It's all good, my friend. It's all good.",Living Room
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Gotta make a good impression, hit my key features. I'm dependable, but not afraid of the occasional premium lager.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Sophie,Penny,Mummy!,Chapman Homestead

4,1,Mark,Ian,The feeling's mutual.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Mark,You look different from your photo. Is the beard new?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Sophie,Penny,"I thought it would give him a bit of edge. We're thinking of going short with the hair soon, too.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Mark,"Makes you look handsome, like a policeman.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Penny,"Oh, thank you. You're obviously very attractive too.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, what next? Am I going to tell her she's got lovely tits?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Sophie,"So, how do you think I'm doing so far?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Relax, Mark, they like you.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Of course, she would say that.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"How do you think it's going, Jez?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Pretty good, seven out of ten. Just keep hitting those key features.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,Cool.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Poor bastard. The women are gonna make marriage mincemeat out of him. He's like a wedding burger and they're the buns.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"So I loved ""Outrageous"".",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,I'm sorry?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"Your track. ""This is Outrageous!"" Soph played it to me.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"Oh, right, that. Shit.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,You ever been to the Big Chill?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"Uh, no.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"Yeah, I went the year before last. But it was a bit much. Well, I took four cans with me, then this guy from security came up, and he said he was from security, but I don't think he really was from security. Anyway, then Dad came and picked me up.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"OK, that's an interesting story.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Great, I'm sitting at the children's table. I'm with the kids. I'm not part of the family at all, I'm the rubber toy brought along for the weirdo to chew on.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Everybody behind me, keep your guns low.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God. The first fiancé challenge and I've got a gun. An actual gun. It's OK, it's perfectly normal, this is the country, this is what farmers do. They go around shooting crows and trespassers and eventually, because of the EU, themselves.",Woods
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"...then I went to Warwick, but I left after a term. They were all a bunch of fakers. I still got the bag from the Freshers' Fair, though. Pretty cool bag. I'll show it to you later, if you want.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"Mm-hmm, Jamie, where's your gun?",Woods
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,Jamie doesn't shoot.,Woods
4,1,Mark,Jamie,"Oh, do you not believe in-?",Woods
4,1,Jamie,Mark,I'm not allowed.,Woods
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Don't ask why. Don't ask, don't tell.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Jamie,"Oh, right.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"No, of course he's not allowed 'cause he's Mark Chapman in the making and I'm very much a 21st century Lennon.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So, I'm Jamie's bum boy, is that it? I'm the fluffer. I'm going home, Mark.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, please, I need to make a good impression. Jamie's not such a bad guy. Stay.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,And what if I don't? Are you going to shoot me?,Woods
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,Of course I'm not going to shoot you.,Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"If you shoot me, I'll shoot you straight back. You do realise that?",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"OK, here we go. Remember, tight against the shoulder.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"I got it. I got one, I got one!",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Congratulations, you've killed a sentient being.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Well done, Mark, but you only winged it.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Oh, is that not-?",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Nope, you've gotta finish it off.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Oh, right.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"No, don't shoot it. God!",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"What, shall I-?",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Don't stamp on it, Jesus. Wring its neck.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,Its neck?,Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Yes, wring its neck, it's suffering.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Mark,"This is the ultimate good impression test. If I can do this, I'll never have to carve a chicken or discuss spark plugs or prove I love his daughter.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Now, be careful you don't- oh, Mark, you've pulled its bloody head off.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,There's blood all over me.,Woods
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Teas, coffees for the huntsmen.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Sophie,"No teas for the beast-master, thanks. He feasts on the blood of his prey.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"There you go. It's got a bit of a head on, but I'm sure you'll see to that in a hurry.",Pub
4,1,Sophie,Ian,"Oh, Dad, don't go one about it. It was horrible. OK, well I'll leave you two together.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Sophie,I'm sorry?,Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,Sophie and Penny thought it might be nice if you and I had an evening together.,Pub
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Oh, great, a whole evening.",Pub
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"I'm taking Jamie to Guildford. There's this gig in a pub and he thinks maybe they'll let him play at the end. Who knows, maybe they will. OK, see you boys later.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh shit, oh no.",Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,So...,Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,I have very little to say to my closest friends. What the hell am I gonna say to a fully grown man for a whole night?,Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,You're the man who's going to marry my Sophie?,Pub
4,1,Mark,Ian,That's me all right.,Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,Probably.,Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,And you love her?,Pub
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Yes, I do, sir.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, ""sir"". This isn't Tennessee, Mark.",Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Because that's all I care about. Because if there's one little crack of doubt, after thirty years... well, never get older, that's all I'm saying.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Right, yeah, that's good advice.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, here we go. He's got no-one else to talk to but the sheep and the trees. This is what happens if you live too far from proper franchised coffee outlets.",Pub
4,1,Ian,Mark,"You need the love, Mark. Because the physical stuff, that goes, inevitably. That all goes.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Well, that's good, 'cause me and Soph, it's, you know... love.",Pub
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Or my fear of loneliness and her strong desire to get pregnant by almost anyone, so long as it happens this year.",Pub
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Hello.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, alone with the mum. Just act normal. She doesn't know I'm not wearing any pants.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"Jez, I'm so delighted about you and Jamie. He hasn't had a proper friend since he was thirteen.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Oh, right, yeah. I mean, we only watched the Lion King and his Fatboy Slim DVD.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"Listen, I've been thinking, what with Ian's mum passed away, we've got the Volvo and the Subaru. Maybe you could have her old Golf.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Wow.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"You could come and see us, and Jamie.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Right, well, brilliant.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"One Jezmobile. No strings attached. I mean, obviously loads of strings but just ignore the strings.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"So, whatcha making, Mrs. C?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Just some Blair resignation jam.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Oh, right, Blair, yeah. I see, nice.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"I theme my jams, it makes them more fun.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Cool, very cool.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Do you like jam?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Um, yep.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"Yes, sometimes I feel like I could do with a friend out here.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Yeah. It's good to have a friend.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Have a proper taste.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Suck Mummy's finger. Do I suck the finger?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Good?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Mmm, very good. I mean, I've got a girlfriend.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Try the Diana Memorial strawberry.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, I'm finger sucking. Is this wrong? Maybe this is totally normal. Maybe this is what they do in the country.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Good.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"You like it, don't you?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Yes, I do like it.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,Try this.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Maybe she just likes having her finger sucked. I mean, I don't mind, but eventually it's going to get cloying.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,I expect you've noticed Ian's a little older than me. He used to enjoy doing lots of things that he doesn't like doing any more.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"No, yeah, I'm sure.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"So, there you are. I'm a woman.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,Indeed.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,And you're a man.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Penny,"Technically, mm-hmm, yes.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Jeremy,"So, what are you gonna do about that?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, it's not gonna be just the jam. So what am I gonna do? It's almost like a moral decision, but not really, 'cause no one will find out.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Goodbye beard, hello familiar, stupid face.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,So how did it go down the pub? Make a good impression?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Er, yeah, yeah. I think so. But it got me thinking about Sophie and the wedding and how I probably don't properly love her.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes. I think... I think I'm gonna call it off, Jez.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Wow. That's... I'm impressed, Mark.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Could go for a high five. Probably not the most appropriate time.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So, is that why, the beard?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,I thought you liked the beard.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Well I had to pretend that, even to myself. I mean, what sort of man would grow an unwanted beard to order?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So, when are you gonna call it off?",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know, it's difficult. I mean, ideally, it would be somewhere with nice surroundings.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Somewhere with flowers, coffee and sedatives, medical assistance. Maybe with music, but not too jaunty. Melancholy music.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Right. So where are you planning to find this magical musical break-up hospital?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh shit! That'll be Sophie, looking for nookie. I can't see her now, pretend to be asleep.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Why don't you just finish it now?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I can't do it now. You don't just declare war, Jeremy. You prime the press, you square the UN, you make up your reasons. Snore.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Mark,"I heard you snoring, but you're not asleep.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Penny,"No, just... practicing. I was showing Jeremy some techniques.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Penny,Mark,"I'm sure Jeremy's got plenty of his own techniques. I just wanted to check you were back OK Mark, and say how lovely it is to have you both here. Night.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Please, no. Please, tell me no.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"That, the smutty smile. Jeremy, please tell me that nothing's going on there.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,Nothing is going on there.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,Let's just say that nothing is going on there.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. Actually, I did want to tell someone. I mean, it was so cool. She had all this jam-",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, my God, you didn't! You fucked her! Jeremy, you need chemical castration, you're out of control! That's Sophie's mother!",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,She's hot.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"She's not out of Hollyoaks Jeremy! She probably had a ration book! Oh, you're a piece of work, aren't you! I'm down in the pub putting the hours in with the dad and you're back at the house banging the mum! That is not a good impression.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't know, I think I made a pretty good impression.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, please, don't smile like that. You're not James Bond. You're disgusting.",Chapman Homestead
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,I am James Bond.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Ian,Mark,"I'm sorry you have to be out here with me watching this. Just me walking about, basically. Penny wanted us out of the house and what Penny wants, Penny gets.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"No, it's fine. I mean, if I wasn't here I'd just be sitting around with Soph. I can see her any time.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So come on, Mark, why haven't you told her yet?",Woods
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Shh, can he hear?",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,He can't hear.,Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"Can you, you big fox-hunting, badger-baiting tweed-shirt bumfuck homophobe? Oh, shit.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,Bottle cap. Another one for the collection.,Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So come on, are you having second thoughts?",Woods
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know, maybe. I mean, she's so nice. So what if I don't really love her. Charles didn't really love Diana and they were all right. Sort of.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,You don't really love Sophie?,Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"What, no.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,That's what you said.,Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"No, I didn't.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Yes, you did.",Woods
4,1,Mark,Ian,"No, no, because of... distortion. There was probably a buzz. There might be an ancient Saxon coin right here.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Stop it, Mark. I heard every word.",Woods
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,"And for the record, Jeremy, I may be a homophobe but I'm no badger baiter.",Woods
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"So, I like your barn, Ian.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,It's full of crap no-one has any use for. Maybe that's why I feel so at home here. Ha.,Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Mark, if you don't love Sophie, you shouldn't marry her.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Yes, that's what I've actually been thinking. That's what I'm gonna tell her.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Mark,The good-impression thermometer is reaching absolute zero.,Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"For what it's worth, I'm sorry.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"You know what, I'm glad. I'd rather you came clean now than start something that's not right. That actually takes balls.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Well, thank you.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"Sometimes, I wish I had the guts to say something. Do something. What would you do if you were trapped in a loveless marriage? If you knew your wife was cheating on you?",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Shit!,Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"You know what, I'd probably just leave it. Let it slide. So, what's the best bit of metal you've ever detected?",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,"I know my wife. And I know who the culprit is, Jeremy.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh my God, that's why he brought us out here. He's gonna kill me. Can you kill someone with a metal detector?",Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Ian, I just wanna say that I know that people can be very stupid and selfish but really, it's our fast-food culture of instant gratification you should be angry with.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"No, Dan. Fucking Dan Walker.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, thank you, Dan, whoever you are.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,"Penny's probably been doing his curtains all day. Out you lot go, I'm ramming Dan. Oh, yeah, it was Ramadan at his place today, but he's no Muslim.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,Dan. What a filthy-,Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,Maybe it's time I did something. Show Dan who the lord of the manor is around here. What do you think?,Ian's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,"Er, well maybe we should just-",Ian's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"Yeah, let's get Dan. Punish Dan.",Ian's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"There it is, Dan's barn.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,Or you could just post something negative on the internet or blank him in the Post Office? That would send out a pretty horrible message.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,"This is the law of the jungle, this is an eye for an eye.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Ian,And you're sure you're poking the right man in the eye?,Dan's Barn
4,1,Ian,Mark,Light it.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Well, this is not what I expected. You think you'll be playing Simpsons Monopoly and you end up an arsonist. Still, at least it's not me he's trying to incinerate.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,What was all that about? Trying to get him to poke me in the eye? Let him poke Dan in the eye.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, so instead of you facing up to your responsibilities, poor old Dan's going to wake up with his barn burned, saying goodbye to his no-claims bonus.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, stop moaning. We're out with a man who owns guns. You're chucking his daughter, and I've screwed his wife. Tonight is going, if a bit weird, extremely fucking well for us.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I suppose you're right. Plus, maybe burning stuff is... not normal but less of a big deal out here than it is in a major conurbation.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Exactly. I nick your milk, you burn my barn.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Like scrumping, for apples.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Ian,Jeremy,That'll teach him to put his dick where it's not wanted.,Dan's Barn
4,1,Jeremy,Ian,"Yeah, take that, barny.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh God, I'm a firestarter. A twisted firestarter.",Dan's Barn
4,1,Penny,Sophie,You ready for your big birthday surprise?,Outside
4,1,Sophie,Penny,Yeah.,Outside
4,1,Penny,Mark,Keep up everybody.,Outside
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I'm a motherfucker, that's literally what I am.",Outside
4,1,Mark,Sophie,Happy birthday. I hope it'll be a memorable day.,Outside
4,1,Mark,Mark,Of course it's gonna be memorable. The day she's humiliated and broken in front of her family.,Outside
4,1,Sophie,Mark,So what happened with the beard? We didn't get a chance to speak.,Outside
4,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, that. When I was shaving, I sort of slipped and I tried evening it out but it just got smaller and smaller until I looked like an evil overlord, so I just lost it.",Outside
4,1,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, the new look.",Outside
4,1,Mark,Sophie,I know.,Outside
4,1,Mark,Mark,"Yes, your jurisdiction over my face is hereby rescinded. Shit. But can I really break it to her? Should I? I mean, she's lovely, she's attractive. She does irritate me, but everyone irritates me.",Outside
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"So, I was wondering if you'd listen to my track. It's probably shit but you can smoke a joint and it might sound all right.",Outside
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"Mmm-hmm, great.",Outside
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,"So, it must be amazing, London. What's it like down the King's Road?",Outside
4,1,Jeremy,Jamie,"Oh, cool. It's got a Pret, it's got a Virgin Express, it's got a Gap and a massive Cafe Nero.",Outside
4,1,Jamie,Jeremy,Cool.,Outside
4,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,He thinks I'm his way into the music biz. Forget it. Music's full.,Outside
4,1,Penny,Sophie,Ta-da!,Outside
4,1,Sophie,Penny,Nana's cottage?,Outside
4,1,Penny,Sophie,It's yours and Mark's. To do whatever you want with.,Outside

4,1,Ian,Penny,Sod you all.,Chapman Homestead
4,1,Mark,Mark,"OK, in a way, I've made a good impression. I mean, it wasn't me who set fire to the barn or screwed Penny. In fact, I'm winning. I'm getting half a rural cottage and all I have to do is enter a loveless husk of a marriage.",Chapman Homestead

4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"Nice to meet you, Martin.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh great, here we go. I'm just another cock getting wired into the global economy. Urgh, how should I look like? Bond-like neutrality? As though I'm so used to real-life naked women? Or... don't want to be rude. Smiling encouragement? That's not a leer, is it? Got to avoid the leer at all costs. And the dribble. Oh God, she looks amazing. This really should not be allowed. This is what men want, and we shouldn't be allowed to have it, because it's horrible and it makes you feel sick. Oh great, now I'm getting an erection. How grimly predictable. When's the work gonna happen?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"I'm very sorry, and you're a very attractive woman, but I have got a hell of a lot on, so...",Lap Dancing Club

4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"Oh, just a proposal, so...",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"Well, you haven't written very much, have you? You should try and sum up all your aims in the first line.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"Right, this is a very complex business proposal, so I really don't think you could sum up all the aims in one line.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"If you can't sum up all your aims in the first line, then they're too diffuse.",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Mark,Lap Dancer,"Look, my aims are not too fucking diffuse, OK?",Lap Dancing Club
4,2,Lap Dancer,Mark,"Fine, Jesus. They just might be too diffuse, that was all I was saying.",Lap Dancing Club

4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Oh, go on. Before you get your booty locked up by Captain Corrigan.",Kettering Hotel Room
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,She's so cool and nice. How did Mark even manage to get anything going with her? I guess she must have some massive character defect that only becomes apparent after a while.,Kettering Hotel Room

4,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Oh, pretty terrible. I mean, I came to try and win her back, but I don't even know if I like her, or...",Kettering Hotel Room

4,2,Mark,Gerrard,"Yes, of course. OK, so, final analysis. What have we actually got, what am I gonna present to the board? Not that, that sounded good at 3am when we were high on Diet Coke. That's bullshit. That's just table talk, that's not fit for public consumption. This... is that it? Where's the actual sustenance, where's the beef? Gerrard, we've got... there's... nothing. I've got nothing, I've got fucking nothing here. We haven't got anything. We've spent all night doing nothing, Gerrard, you prick!",Kettering

4,2,Jeremy,Mark,Maybe you should run away.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, thanks Jez.",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, I mean, people say it like it's a bad thing, you know, running away from your problems. But if your problems never catch up with you, what's the hitch?",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, well in this case, there would be repercussions.",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,What do you care? You'd be in the woods playing the ukulele with the rabbits and the squirrels.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Jeremy,I suppose I could run away.,Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Do it, man!",Kettering
4,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I think that was good advice. I mean, I didn't actually expect him to do it. Maybe I wouldn't have said it if I'd thought there was any chance of him actually doing it, but, yep, there he goes.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,"God, I'm running away. This is brilliant. Maybe I'll go to a KFC and have a whole bargain bucket. Or I could join Al Qaeda. Maybe I'll marry my lap dancer. I do think, in a weird way, we had a connection. Fuck the Blockbusters fine, I'm going clear!",Kettering

4,2,Jeremy,Big Suze,"In that case, if you'll excuse me.",Kettering
4,2,Mark,Mark,"Shit, this could be difficult to row back from. This isn't a misspelt email. This is going feral. I mean, rejecting society and seeking the company of wild creatures, that's not going to look good on my quarterly review. What's Jeremy stealing, hotel napkins?",Car Park

4,2,Mark,Sophie,Do you really think?,Car Park
4,2,Sophie,Mark,Of course.,Car Park
4,2,Mark,Sophie,Maybe she's right. Maybe the truth does work. Maybe Iraq was a good idea. Maybe I am putting enough into my pension plan. Maybe computer games aren't a waste of time. Maybe OJ's innocent! Maybe everything's gonna be OK!,Car Park

4,2,Mark,Board Member,"So, integrating Sales and Marketing, Project Zeus. The bad news is, it doesn't work. But, look, big picture, so what? Maybe we shouldn't be in the credit business at all. Maybe we should look at human rights or global warming. I mean, these are just ideas, but... where's the humanity? I suppose that's what I want to ask you today, if anything, where is the humanity? Old friend.",Kettering

4,2,Mark,Mark,Did I just say that? I did just say that.,Kettering
4,2,Mark,Board Member,"Yep, that's right, I've got brain cancer. Half my brain's been eaten away already, probably, but I think I did a pretty decent job for a man with a brain tumour the size of a pineapple who's gonna be dead within a month.",Kettering

4,3,Jeremy,Mark,It's her birthday. I'm going to pick the most savage ones and then post them to her.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,So I take it you haven't got over her going off with Johnson.,Living Room

4,3,Mark,Matt,My goals,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,Does hiding from my fiancée count?,Gym

4,3,Matt,Mark,A system?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Yeah, it's complicated. I don't want to waste water so I have my own methods, but they're all totally normal. I'll explain them to you sometime over a beer. See you Friday.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,See you.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, that was horrible. Now he probably thinks I'm embarrassed about the size of my penis, when in fact I'm not. I'm much more concerned about my misshapen scrotum.",Gym

4,3,Mark,Nancy,"Oh, right. Well, it's really nice to see you again.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Mark,"Yeah, no it's a great to have some downtime working here, 'cause all that crank totally fucked with my mind. I mean, it was pretty well blown to pieces by the size of the IMAX image every day anyway, so...",Gym
4,3,Mark,Nancy,"Oh, yeah. Cranking at the IMAX. Don't I know it.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"I've got to tell Jez about Nancy. This will blow him away, or could tip him over the edge. Maybe it would be kinder not to tell him. It would certainly give me a weird feeling of secret power. Jesus, what's that man doing? I should do something. If decent people like me do nothing, then what? Then they'll come for the trade unionists, although that, to be honest, wouldn't really bother me too much. Hey, I know that weird run!",Outside

4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Or our wedding day. I mean, that was a happy memory. Remember that, wifey?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"She's gone. Still, try again tomorrow, she'll probably feel a whole lot differently. So, can you give me another guest pass?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Another one?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,It's important.,Gym

4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"No, sure, maybe a bit of oral, but I could never really enjoy it.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Look, Jez, I'm not gonna get back with you, but if we're working together I guess we may as well try and be friends.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Exactly, we'll be friends, like the friends on Friends.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Who were such good friends, they got bored of being friends and started screwing each other.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, what's new in your world?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Well I'm really into Judo at the moment, and the instructor here, Matt, is a hundred-degree hottie.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,Great.,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"God, I'd really love to bone him.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Well that's what you should do, then. You should bone him. I'd like to watch. Only joking.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Must remember, watching someone you love having sex isn't that fun.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"How about you, you seeing anyone?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,No.,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,What about Eva? She doesn't have a boyfriend.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Don't think so, she's not really my type.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Is it because she's from the third world and used to live in a hut?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Poland isn't in the third world, Nance. They don't live in huts.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Well, still it's a shame. She's a great girl and she's like my best friend here.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Others,"Champers Spa, can I help?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Maybe I can use Eva as a decoy. ""Hey Nancy, I fancy your friend,"" then ""Oh shit, look, my lips have slipped and I'm kissing you.""",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"You know, I'm the first white English person on the cleaning staff. I'm getting a whole new view of life, the other side of the potato. They have these sandwiches, but they don't come from shops, they make them themselves.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"I make my own sandwiches, Jeremy. Making your own sandwiches is not an indication of a gritty life on the never-never.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"It's like Titanic. You're upstairs in your starched collar, while I'm down below decks dancing a jig with the Poles and the Africans, having a better time than you could possibly imagine.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Just make sure you clean up in the changing room toilet. There's a big pool of rusty water by the urinals and it turns my stomach.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Sophie,Hello?,Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Hi Mark, whatcha doin'?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, just hanging out in the gym. You know, pushing for the burn.",Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Oh right, I was hoping I might see you tonight.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, I'd love to, it's just I've got a session booked with Matt and uh...",Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,Well I wouldn't want to stop you getting fit and healthy for the wedding.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Ha ha. Physical well-being, the perfect alibi.",Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"OK, well I guess I'll see you tomorrow at the office.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"OK then, see you.",Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,Bye.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Sophie.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Hey, Nancy!",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Hey, Jez.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, I've been thinking about what we discussed, and I do actually, definitely, fancy Eva.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Thought she wasn't your type?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Oh, Nancy, you know me, I don't really have a type. If it moves, I'll try and hump it. So tonight, why don't we all go to the cinema?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"OK, and why don't I invite Matt? Double date.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Fuck.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Yeah, but do you really wanna take the risk of asking him? There's a chance he might just laugh in your face and call you a slag.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Right, God no. Why don't you put in a good word for me with Matt, and I'll put in a good word for you with Eva?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Great, OK! We'll set it up for the staff party on Thursday.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Thanks, you're awesome Jez!",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, I'm awesome all right. I'm an awesome shit. I'm the cuckoo in the nest, the python in the toy box, and, quite possibly, the man of your dreams.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"It's Matt, isn't it?",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,And you are?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"Jeremy, yeah. I've got a message from Nancy on reception.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,The gorgeous blonde?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"Yeah, she says she's seen you looking at her and she thinks you're disgusting.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"Oh, shit.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"Yeah, she says you stare at her like a sex offender. And, if you keep doing it, she'll call the police.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"God! Well, she did smile at me once, so I just caught her eye. Could you tell her I'm sorry?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"I'll tell her. But she says if she sees you doing it again, she knows some bad dudes and they'll... do you even want to know?",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,I'd better.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,She says they'll rip your cock off and stuff it in your mouth.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,Jeez!,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,Sorry to be the messenger. Don't shoot me!,Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"No, dude, thanks for letting me know.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"It's cool. I've got your back, dude.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,And I've got your hairy plums in the palm of my hand.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Might as well pile on a few more spoonfuls. Who cares if I put on a bit of weight? I'm engaged to be married, mating season is over.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Mark, you're not full yet?",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"This is just fuel for the engine, Soph. I'll burn this off on the treadmill in, like, a second.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,Do you think we're a good couple?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,Uh oh.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Um, yeah. I mean, you've got to be realistic, we're no Edward and Mrs. Simpson, but, yeah.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,I think that was a good answer.,Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,Do you think we spend enough time together?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,Um...,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,Where's this going?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Well, yeah, I think we do.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"You just seem to spend so much time in the gym, you seem to love it so much, I was thinking maybe I might join.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,Shit!,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, well, that would be... great.",Living Room
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"I'd like to see more of Nancy and I think it'd be fun, the two of us doing something like that together. I could go on the exercise bike in front of you and we could pretend you were chasing me!",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Brilliant, she's located my bunker and now she's invading. She's flushing me out with dogs and grenades, and a sincere desire to spend time with me.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Staff party, Nancy, sauna, champagne. This is the kind of thing that should be happening to me on a daily fucking basis.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Jeremy, where's Eva?",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Oh, she went to chill out in the flotation tank.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Right, aren't you two supposed to-",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"No, no. I made a joke about Lech Wałęsa and she took offence, then she started getting really snitty about UK hip-hop so things just fell apart.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Oh, that's a shame.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Could use my sauna line.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Cor, it's like a sauna in here!",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Classic line. That is just a great line. Got to manoeuvre more dates into saunas.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, how's it going? Enjoy the party?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,Not really. Matt spent the whole evening looking straight past me. Did you get a chance to talk to him?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"As a matter of fact, I did, yeah.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,How'd it go? What did he say?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,I probably shouldn't tell you.,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,"Oh, come on, please.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"He said he's not really into anything serious at the moment. He's looking for, quote-unquote, a fuck-monkey.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,A fuck-monkey? He said that?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Yeah, and not even the good kind of fuck-monkey.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,I can't believe he would say that.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Men do and say horrible things. I know I have, but I'm lucky because I've been given another chance to be your friend. And I wouldn't trade a moment of that friendship for a lifetime of fuck-monkey jungle action.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,What the-?,Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,It's Eva in the flotation tank! She must have hit the panic button.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"The gooseberry's revenge! That hairy gooseberry, she couldn't just stay in her bloody punnet, could she?",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,How did they get on there?,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"I don't know, maybe some stoned weightlifter playing a prank or something?",Gym
4,3,Eva,Jeremy,I couldn't get out! It was so dark! So dark!,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Eva,"Still, there are worse places to get trapped, right? I mean, you must be bloody relaxed by now.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,Why do they have to park the bikes right in front of the sexualizer? Be so demeaning to get a bonk-on while exercising.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Yeah come on, dude, let's take it all the way up. Now can you take some more? Can you? Do you want it?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,What am I meant to say? Can I say no?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,I want it.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"He's broken me, I'll say anything now.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"That's alpine uphill. Now that's serious shit. Work it, big man. So how's the food plan going? What'd you have for dinner last night?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Well, I was late in so, the fridge was bare, I...",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"What was it, dude?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Pizza, from San Marco's.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"San Marco's?! When there's a sushi bar right next door? You know you're going to end up fat like a house. I mean, take a look at my stomach. Let's have a look at yours.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,Which is better?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,Could claim mine is better.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Yours.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Exactly, so no more pizza. What are you doing tonight?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Going to the pub with Jeremy.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,Don't go to the pub with Jeremy. Ask Sadie out for a smoothie.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Her? Why?,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,Well you need some more options now things are going down the shitter with Sophie.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Right, yeah, but be a bit quiet, maybe, Matt.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Oh relax, fat boy. Now, come on, let's take it up a notch. Let's rock it all the way to the top. Can you take some more? Do you want some more? Do you? Do you want it? Do you want it?",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,No!,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,What?,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"No, I don't want it, all right? Fuck off. You've made it too hard, I can hardly fucking pedal. No mountain is that hard, it's just not realistic.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, I've got two bits of bad news, one affecting me, and the other affecting you. Which do you want to hear first?",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Er, the one affecting me, then I can have the one affecting you as dessert.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, Nancy told me she spoke to Matt at Judo class and she's going to ask him out on a date.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,What?! What about all my fuck-monkey stuff?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah well, she said she decided it wouldn't be so bad spending all day eating bananas, and fucking with Matt Townsend.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, shit. That's disgusting. I'm depressed. What's your bad news?",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Sophie's planning to join the gym.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,What's so bad about that?,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Because I've told Matt I don't really want to marry her.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Oh.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"She's getting dangerously close to my web of lies, Jez.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"But isn't it quite good if she does find out? I mean, you know, so you don't break both your hearts?",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"No, she can't ever know! It's all arranged, Jeremy, it's an arranged marriage. My dad literally congratulated me, Jez. He sent me a greetings card with a pre-printed message expressing a good deal of happiness. This is my chance to be a proper human being.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, yeah.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Like that's ever going to happen.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"And now Matt's going to spill the beans to Sophie or to Nancy and then she'll tell Sophie. What am I going to do, Jez?",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, what am I going to do? Maybe I'll tell Nancy Matt's got AIDS. But then she'd say, ""Sorry,"" and he'd say, ""Why?"" And she'd say, ""Oh, I thought you had AIDS."" And he'd say, ""No."" And then they'd just start fucking.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, both of us can't pace. It's like a prison yard in here.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Sorry.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,We need to get rid of Matt.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, get rid of Matt. And fast, before Nancy asks him out.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,We need a clever plan. What would de Botton do? An evil Alain de Botton?,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,Kill him? There's an incinerator round the back of the gym.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"De Botton wouldn't kill, we're not going to kill him.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,We could say he poos in the pool.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,That's not beyond the realms of possibility.,Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"He'd definitely get the sack for that. Plus, what kind of a freak would do that? It should screw his chances with Nancy for good.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, could work. Although, I suppose, I mean, one of us would have to... in the pool.",Living Room
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"No, we just lie. Shame in a way, because I've always kind of wanted to poo in a pool.",Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,Really? I did not know that about you.,Living Room
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"I really don't feel comfortable about this, Jez.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"It'll be fine, just follow my lead.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,"Sorry to keep you, Mr. Corrigan.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Well this is going to be incredibly painful, but at least I'm doing the right thing. Sort of.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,I understand you might be able to back up Jeremy's story about the item found in the pool.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, my God! He actually- he couldn't resist!",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,Did you see Matt Townsend do this?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Well, I didn't actually see him, but I have my suspicions.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,Why?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,He mentioned to me that he likes to do that.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,He did?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Yes, he said he loves to do that.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,"OK, I'll have a word with Matt. My apologies, but I'm sure we can straighten this out.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Not straighten out, sack the innocent man!",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,There was that other thing.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,Another thing?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, the other thing. Remember, what you told me? About your knob?",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Oh uh, yes. I didn't want to mention that but... Matt, he touched my penis.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Others,"Karen, could you ask Matt Townsend to come to my office immediately?",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Matt,Gym Manager,They say I did a poo in the pool? And I touched him?,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Matt,Yes.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Gym Manager,Mark,"Can you describe exactly what happened, Mr. Corrigan?",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Gym Manager,"Well, he was giving me a massage and he was going up my legs and my thighs, and then he touched my penis, and then he rubbed my penis quite a bit. I said stop, but he wouldn't stop.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Mark, why are you saying this? I don't understand.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Matt,Because it's true.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Matt,Mark,"Please, don't do this, this is my career.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,You should have thought about that when you were touching his cock.,Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, this is all so horrible. Maybe it would have been simpler just to kill him. I should know how to kill someone by now, I've watched enough CSI.",Gym Manager's Office
4,3,Nancy,Jeremy,I can't believe they got rid of Matt.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Oh, Nance, he's a pool poo-er. You know what that means? He poos in the pool.",Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Right, I'm gonna beat your ass, Corrigan.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Maybe we'll be happy ever after. Maybe I'll look back and say Judo brought us together. Maybe we'll have a Judo-themed wedding, and get married in Judo suits, and I'll cut the cake with my hand.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Mark,"Shit, Matt. He wants to punch and kick me, and he's come somewhere where he's allowed to punch and kick me.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,Mark.,Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"Matt, I thought you weren't working here any more.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,I can still come to classes.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Sophie,Do you mind if I cut in?,Gym
4,3,Sophie,Matt,"Oh, no, I'm a complete beginner so...",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,Leave me alone.,Gym
4,3,Sophie,Mark,"Mark, just fight him, we're in a class. He's not going to hurt you.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Sophie,He is going to hurt me.,Gym
4,3,Matt,Mark,"You're pathetic, Corrigan, do you know that? A pathetic, flabby worm.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Matt,"He's here, too.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, that's great, thanks a lot.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,"It's all right, Jez. Use your woman as a human shield.",Gym
4,3,Nancy,Matt,"Matt, violence never solved anything. Love thy neighbour as thyself.",Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Matt,"Yeah, exactly. Fuck off.",Gym
4,3,Matt,Jeremy,"Well, you can't stay hiding there forever.",Gym
4,3,Mark,Jeremy,He thinks we can't stay hiding here forever.,Gym
4,3,Jeremy,Mark,"He really doesn't know us at all, does he?",Gym
4,4,Mark,Mark,"What a dud evening. Low quality takeaway, low quality detective drama, low quality sexual intercourse.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"So, Soph, do you fancy coming along to my school reunion on Saturday?",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"School reunion, that doesn't sound very you.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, but I thought it might be nice to go and, you know, show them all that I've got a job and a flat and a fiancée now. And I'm not in fact a gender bender, a mentaloid or a public leaning post after all.",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Right. OK, the thing is, the thing, I think I mentioned. I'll be heading off late Saturday night.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,What thing?,Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,Frankfurt. Marketing development group? Me and Alan and Lisa and Jeff.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,Jeff's going to Frankfurt? You're going to Frankfurt with your ex?,Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Not with him. It's work, Mark. Did I not mention it?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"No, no, no you did not mention it.",Living Room

4,4,Mark,Mark,"OK, definitely have a legitimate grievance here I reckon. Let's milk it.",Living Room
4,4,Sophie,Mark,"Mark, Jeff and I aren't going to fall into each other's arms in a pile of sauerkraut. I am getting married to you, OK?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, sure.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Maybe I should just go on my own. Sally Slater might be there. Mm, Sally, one of the few girls in my year to notice me and yet still not mock. It'd be good to see her again, and I'm sure Sophie won't mind. In fact, she's definitely not gonna mind 'cause I'm not gonna tell her.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yeah, great night at the pub this is. Laura's caught in Super Hans's tractor beam. Kerry's being all lovely to Mike about his mum's thyroid thing. I've got no way out. Stuck with the newbie, Mr. Fucking Shirt. Got to say something.",Pub

4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Can I get you a drink?,Pub

4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Well that sounds amazing.,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,Orgazoid's handyman. This is a dream come true. Handyman to chauffeur to keyboard player. It's a very well-established career path.,Pub
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh man, my job is the nuts. I had a great first day.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"By your job, you mean being a handyman for a man called The Orgazoid?",Living Room

4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"What?! Come on Jeremy, nobody gets paid five hundred pounds a week to do nothing.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,It's not nothing. Making smoothies from a smoothie maker is not nothing. You should try cleaning one of those mothers.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No, there's got to be a catch. You're gonna be his drugs mule. He's gonna sell your organs or invite a German around from the internet to eat you. And where did you even meet him? The snooker club that used to be a public toilet? Seriously, I'm concerned about this arrangement.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Why does everything good have to be some horrible arrangement? Me and Russell are just two guys having a nice time. That's what life is supposed to be like in case you've forgotten.,Living Room

4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, well as you're always saying, the Beastie Boys fought - and possibly died - for my right to party so...",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, come on, what the hell's going on?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"All right, look, I've been invited to the Polefield School reunion at a school disco club, and-",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,They all hated you at Polefield.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, the vast majority, but there were some crumbs of comfort. The chess players, the musicians, the poor and the posh-voiced. We formed a substrata, a secret society below the radar of the norms.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,The norms?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"The normallows, the Norman forces, our oppressors.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, well this I have got to see. I could invite Nancy. Yeah, brilliant excuse to see her.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Haven't you got work in the morning?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah, that's really gonna break his balls if I roll in an hour late. Mark, this is Russell Orgazoid. He's a creative, I'm a creative. We don't make steam engines out of pig iron in this country any more, yeah? We hang out, we fuck around on the PlayStation, we have some Ben and Jerry's. That's how everyone makes their money now, yeah?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Here they all are, my tormentors.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Hope Nancy gets here soon. This is gonna be perfect. She won't know anyone except me.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"That's Faizel Butt. He used to call me a flod. I think it was a mixture between a flid and a spod. That's Foz. He used to sit behind me in French and put bacon on my shoulders. That's Terry Carpenter. One of the more sophisticated bullies. Pretended I was Thatcher and he was Heseltine, and I needed ousting. I need a drink.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, there she is. Lovely Sally Slater. I should speak to her, but what the hell can I say? Anything that doesn't mention I masturbate over her memory is probably good. I mean I think that's a compliment, but women just don't seem to want to hear it. No, just spend the evening looking longingly at her from a distance, like the good old days.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,Mark! Is it Mark Corrigan?,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Yeah, I forget, are you Sally? Good to see you. I have a job and a flat of my own now, so... it's great to see you. God, you look great!",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Thanks, so listen, can I get you a drink?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, OK, great.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,Maybe everything will be different now. Maybe all the parameters have shifted. Most of my rivals from school have probably perished in Blair's oil wars.,School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Nancy,Hey Nancy.,School Reunion
4,4,Nancy,Jeremy,"Hey, Jez, great idea. This is so much fun. Come here, meet these great guys.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,She made some friends pretty fucking quick.,School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"So now I'm finally doing an English degree, and I do a bit of cleaning to pay the bills. I listen to the set texts on my iPod when I'm hoovering.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Right, that's cool, I hoover sometimes because I bought my flat and that. From my job as an executive, I had plenty of cash left over to buy a hoover.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Are you boasting, Corrigan?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"No. I mean maybe a bit. Do you remember on that history field trip where you borrowed my Hitchhiker's Guide, and we both read it out in funny voices?",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,Yeah.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,I was thinking that was probably one of the best days of my life.,School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"What, really?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Should I feel guilty? No, Sophie's probably doing it with Jeff to the brutal rhythm of the Oompah band. Why shouldn't I have some mild flirtation? A snog even? Or more?",School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Sally,"Hello, sexy.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh, great, bacon shoulders.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Mark, you remember Foz?",School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Mark,All right Corrigan?,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Hi, Foz.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Please don't hit me for any reason, Foz.",School Reunion
4,4,Sally,Mark,Foz and I are married now.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, right, great.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Obviously, of course. Why didn't I just buy an anvil and smash my face onto it? It would certainly be less hassle.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,So have you got kids?,School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Not yet, why?",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Oh, no reason. I mean, I love kids. Not in a bad way, in a nice way. I mean I'm not on the child protection register... yet! Which proves I'm not a paedo!",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,This is going horribly. Need a joke.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Foz,Either that or I'm an incredibly-hard-to-detect paedo.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,Just move on from the paedo area entirely.,School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, this is Foz and Sally, Jeremy.",School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Jeremy,"All right, mate. So, you're mates with Wankathon?",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Foz,I'm sorry?,School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Mark Wankathon, you remember? At school, when you got taught the wrong way to rub one out and you tried it for two hours.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit, this is just like school. Have to side with the powerful to survive.",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Foz,Ha ha ha two hours!,School Reunion
4,4,Foz,Sally,"Oh, I fucking hate this track, it's brilliant. Come on saucepot.",School Reunion
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh, just like school. I have to sit and watch while the beautiful people dance at me. Except no, she wants me to call her. It's worked. All my references to how much above the national average income I earn have actually worked!",School Reunion
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, making smoothies at The Orgazoid's house. This is the kind of job I deserve. I've paid my dues. All those years signing on every bloody week.",Russell's House
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Ah nice, thanks man. Yeah, take five if you want. Swim a few lengths.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"Oh, cheers, Russell. Yeah, maybe I will.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Nothing dodgy about this. Just going for a swim in my trunks. I can't swim in a three-piece suit, so screw you, cynics.",Russell's House
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Ah now listen, before I forget. I thought you might like this. I did a few different versions of Borneo Function that never got released. I thought you might get a kick out of them.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Oh my God.,Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, Super Hans is gonna shit a brick when I show him this. Finally, something to beat that car battery he nicked off The Prodigy.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"OK, well great chatting to you, Sally.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Hi, honey, I'm home.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Sally,And good luck with Midnight's Children. Remember no one's ever actually finished it. Bye.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Great call, friendly but flirty. Didn't overstep the mark. I could show Sophie the transcript. Maybe I should start taping my phone calls. No, Mark. That's how they got Nixon.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,What's that?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, just a jumper Russell got for me.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,He bought you a jumper? What else has he bought you?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Nothing, Jesus. A squash racquet.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, what's going on? Squash racquets are not a normal form of remuneration.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"He doesn't have anyone to play with. And two people can't share one bloody racquet. Case closed, Columbo.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"So listen, I've organised a trip to the safari park on Saturday with Sally and Foz.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,The safari park? With that dickhead Foz? Have you gone mental?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,It's an ironical day out.,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, I get it. You're just another dirty dog like everyone else.",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,I am not a dirty dog. But I do need you to come. As my... sheath.,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Your sheath?,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, as long as you are there, it's just four people having an apparently nice time at an outdated venue.",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Fucking hell, what's going on? Are you trying to get your end away while Sophie's not here?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Sophie has not called me once yet. So there is actually a perfectly valid excuse for what I'm almost certainly not going to try to do, OK?",Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, if Sally was sitting here now, and she said, Mark, let's do it, what would you say?",Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,If she promised she wasn't a Glenn Close type and happened to have a recent clean AIDS certificate?,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Yes.,Living Room
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,That's a hypothetical question. I don't answer hypothetical questions.,Living Room
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,You're disgusting. But I like it. It's like going to a strip joint with the Pope.,Living Room
4,4,Foz,Sally,A fucking safari park?,Safari Park
4,4,Sally,Foz,"It's cool, it's retro.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Sally,Exactly.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,What exactly is my plan here? Lured them all to the safari park like a Bond villain. But what's the aim? Torture myself with contact with an unattainable woman? Or... what?,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was gonna make it because of my job, but my boss was actually really cool about it.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,That's because it's not a real job.,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah, what about this? Is that real enough for you?",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Don't flaunt your wad, Jeremy, it's not becoming.",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Well you're becoming a pain in the arse. How do you like that?,Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Ha ha ha ha, you wanker, Corrigan.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Hey!,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,See how much money you earned this week.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Give it back, Jeremy!",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Not a lot in here, Mark, apart from a couple of moths.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Give that back!,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oops, butterfingers.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, for God's sake.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Foz, stop the car. Stop the car, Foz. He's- he's thrown my wallet out.",Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Oh my God, he never!",Safari Park
4,4,Sally,Foz,"Stop the car, Foz. It's Mark's wallet!",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,You gonna go and get it?,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No, we need to call the... warder.",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Don't be a dick. Go and get it.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,What if the lions eat me?,Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"The lions aren't gonna eat you, Mark. Just nip and get it.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,You should go and get it.,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,I'm not gonna get it.,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Why should I have to bloody get it?,Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Come on, Mark, just get it. Get it.",Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Fucking hell.,Safari Park
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, I'm getting big laughs off humiliating my best mate. How can something so wrong feel so right?",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Shit, this isn't good. There are lions, there are lions everywhere. Where are they? Is there one behind that tree? Jeremy's literally thrown me to the bloody lions. What's next, crucifixion? Is he gonna have me actually nailed onto a cross?",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Foz,You bloody bastards! Stop! Let me in! You bloody bastards!,Safari Park
4,4,Sally,Foz,"It's not funny, Foz. For fuck's sake, just stop.",Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Sally,"All right, all right, all right. Hold on here he comes, here he comes.",Safari Park
4,4,Foz,Mark,Wahey!,Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Christ, what do you do to avoid lion attack? Soil yourself? Or is that grizzly bears? Hate to shit myself for no reason and get eaten. The final humiliation.",Safari Park
4,4,Mark,Mark,Still nothing from Sophie. Probably busy boning Jeff in Frankfurt. Highly unlikely but possible. I should at least try to feel jealous and betrayed. Then I'll feel less of a shit about pursuing Sally.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, hi Jez. ",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Nancy,Nancy.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"You're here, I thought you'd be down at The Orgazoid's.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well actually Russell had to go off to Norway this morning, so I'm just here. Is that all right, Dad?",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, yeah, but are you all right?",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, I'm fine.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,What's bothering him? He's thinking about something. He never normally thinks about things.,Kitchen
4,4,Nancy,Jeremy,So will you ask him now?,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Is it OK if Nancy uses the computer to redo her CV?,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,My computer?,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Your computer, the computer, whatever.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,Sally!,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Nancy,Sure.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,Hello?,Kitchen

4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh good, good thanks.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Listen, I'm so sorry about yesterday.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, don't worry, that's fine. It was funny, probably, if it hadn't been happening to me, it might have been funny.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,"But look, it was great seeing you, and it would be great to meet up again.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh right, well, I'd love to.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,How about tomorrow? I could drop around to your flat about three?,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Yeah, the flat, that sounds lovely.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,"I can't invite her around here. Anyone could be here. Sophie will find out. Nothing's gonna happen, but nothing must remain a total secret.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,"So, what's your address?",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"My address, hold on let me just check.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,You need to check your address?,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Well, I do like to be totally accurate.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, what's Orgazoid- Russell's address?",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Why?,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Just give it to me.,Kitchen

4,4,Mark,Sally,"Yep, see you there th- here then.",Kitchen
4,4,Sally,Mark,Bye.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"All right, so Jez, do you think it'll be all right if I sort of borrowed Russell's house?",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No, I don't particularly want to go to that place right now if I'm honest.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well that's OK, if you'd prefer, you can just give me the keys and I'll-",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No, you need me to do the alarms, and there's like six different alarms, but I'm just feeling a bit weird about the whole situation.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah? Why?,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, as it turns out, there were, there are certain additional duties which I was expected to perform.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Duties, what duties?",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, you know, I'm his handyman.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"It's just, he did expect me to... give him a... hand.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,You gave him a hand?,Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,I helped him out.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"You helped him out by giving him a hand. Wow, just to clarify, you do mean...",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,Yes.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,Shit.,Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,"I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"And now I don't know what to do. 'Cause on the one hand- one the one hand it's a really good job. But on the other, I don't really want to go back to that place or have anything to do with him.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"God, that's a really a tough decision.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Stay, stay so I can use the house.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I got Super Hans to fill in yesterday. Said I was sick. There's loads needs doing before he comes back, but I just feel a bit dirty, you know.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Mm-hmm, yeah. I know what you mean, I feel the same sometimes when I come back from JLB and I've had to do loads of spreadsheets.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't think it is the same, Mark. I feel like my soul is being chipped away bit by bit.",Kitchen
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Welcome to the world of work, Jeremy. You know, you don't have to be crazy to work here, but it helps.",Kitchen
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"And you don't have to be a smackhead to wank off old geezers, but that probably helps too.",Kitchen
4,4,Super Hans,Jeremy,Why didn't you tell me about the wanking off bit?,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Sorry, I didn't think.",Flat
4,4,Super Hans,Jeremy,Well you should have bloody thought. Jesus.,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Super Hans,Did you... do it?,Flat
4,4,Super Hans,Jeremy,Of course I did. How'd you think I got these trainers?,Flat
4,4,Nancy,Super Hans,What's going on? Who is wanking who off?,Flat
4,4,Super Hans,Nancy,Jeremy's been wanking off this bloke for cash.,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Nancy,No I haven't! It's not-,Flat
4,4,Nancy,Jeremy,Jeremy that is so you. I always knew you'd end up doing something like that.,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Nancy,What do you mean that is so me? That is not so me.,Flat
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"So I have to jerk him off, but at least I get a lift home. Never mind. Only a few hand shandies between me and a home studio.",Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,I had a chance to think in Norway. Erm... about us.,Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,Us? Yeah?,Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"I've never had to pay for it before, and I don't think I want to pay for it with you.",Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"Oh, right, so can I stop doing it?",Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"Well, I want you to keep doing it, but I want you to do it because you want to do it.",Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,It's just I don't really want to do it. Could I start wearing a mitten? Or maybe chuck a flannel over it?,Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,It's just really difficult for me because I really like you. I just don't think we should see each other for a while. I'm going away to get my head together.,Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Russell,"No, but the thing is I really like you too. I've been hiding my true feelings, even from myself, but now they're all coming out. What a lot of feelings!",Russell's Car
4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"I'm sorry, Jez.",Russell's Car

4,4,Russell,Jeremy,"This is not what I want. Fuck off, Jez.",Russell's Car
4,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"So, as it stands, I'm failing to find work as a prostitute. That doesn't feel good. Still, got his house keys. If I keep working for him, he'll have to keep paying me.",Russell's Car
4,4,Sally,Mark,So this is your flat?,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"This is it. I call it a flat because I'm quite modest, but as you can see, it's actually quite a massive house.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Shit, am I seriously hoping to have sex with Sally Slater? This is all very wrong.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"I always knew you'd do well for yourself, Mark, but this is amazing.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Relax, you don't go to adulterer's prison for drinking tea and playing Connect Four.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"And Jeremy, is he like your butler?",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"There's not much else he can do in the real world, and I've been very lucky and I like to spread that around.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,Glad I sprayed my nuts with aftershave though. You never know how things might turn out. I'm no Nostradamus.,Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,I never knew you were into stuff like this.,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, I just really appreciate the male form.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Right, you know even I think it's kind of beautiful I suppose.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Yeah, there is something beautiful about the male member. It's good to have a look at it now and again. A reminder of what can happen if you're not careful.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,What am I saying? At least he's going. Don't need a witness to this fiasco.,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Here, Sally, I got you a present. Hitchhiker's Guide, it's the same copy we read from at Sutton Hoo. I got it signed by Douglas Adams when he came to the big WH Smiths.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Oh, this is, it's lovely. Thank you, it's so romantic. It's the perfect way to start our affair.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Our affair? OK, that sounds good. What sort of affair were you thinking of? The Dreyfus Affair or more like the Watergate Affair? 'Cause I can tell you right now I'm not burgling any Democrats.",Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Relax, we both want it to happen.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, she's gonna kiss me. I'm such a bastard. I'm meant to be getting married. I'm out of my depth. I thought she was a frightened, little suburban mouse. But no, she's my nightmare. A liberated, sexually adventurous urban woman.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Oh, Sally, Look, I'm really not sure I...",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"What am I doing? This isn't me, I can't have an affair. I'm not French. I'm the least French person on the planet. My favourite cheeses are Cheddar and Red Leicester.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Look, no, I'm sorry Sally. I just don't know if I can do this. I mean, you've got your miserable relationship and the truth is I have got one of my own. And I just feel that, you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And even if it is broke, just ignore it and maybe it'll be sort of OK? Like the environment. Who's that?",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,Is Russell back? Oh no!,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,Foz!,Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Shit, he's fucking followed me again. He's obsessed with the idea that I'm screwing around on him.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"Well, I mean, I suppose you are sort of trying to. Look, the door's locked and...",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Foz,Foz?,Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Jeremy,Where's Sally?,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Great, thanks Jeremy.",Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Sally,Sally!,Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Mark,"Shit, hide! I'll just say I'm working here cleaning.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Sally,"I can't hide, I'm not a good hider.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,What the hell am I doing? I'm doing a Jeremy. This is a wake-up call. I've definitely hit a new low.,Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Foz,"Foz, what are you doing here?",Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Sally,What the fuck are you doing here? Are you screwing wankathon's mate?,Russell's House
4,4,Sally,Foz,"Of course I'm bloody not. I'm cleaning, you arsehole. This is Mark's flat, and Jeremy's his servant.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Sally,"Well, not servant really, more of a-",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Shit, now she calls.",Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Jeremy,What's that?,Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Foz,That's just the normal ringing noise. That's normal.,Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Jeremy,Yeah?,Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,Must hide more. Can't hide more.,Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Mark,"Corrigan, are you spying on my wife? Are you wanking over her?",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Er... yes, yeah that's what I'm doing. I'm spying on her and wanking over her.",Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Mark,"You really are a filthy, little perv, aren't you?",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Foz,"Uh-huh, I suppose so.",Russell's House
4,4,Foz,Sally,"Come on, we're going.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"Wow, he didn't hit me. Bit disappointing. I sort of deserve to be hit.",Russell's House
4,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Cheer up, Mark. At least now you've got a funny story to tell people.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, no, I guess this is a pretty funny story.",Russell's House
4,4,Mark,Mark,"One that I'll never, ever tell anyone because of my deep and burning shame.",Russell's House
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, more data entry tonight. I guess the only good thing is that my life is so boring it feels like it might go on forever. Maybe I'll put on Big Bond Themes and pretend I'm data entering for MI6.",Apollo House

4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Hi Jez.,Flat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"So, listen, you know how depressed you are about getting married?",Flat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"What? Let's not drag that up now, I'm looking forward to it, that's the line. Besides, it's possible I might have found a way out.",Kitchen
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's in four weeks, Mark. It's going to happen. Look, no matter how unpalatable it may be, the fact is, I'm your best friend. And I know you don't wanna hear it but, I love you. And, in your own dried up, desiccated, weird and unfriendly way, you love me too. So, I've got together my last scraps of cash to give you the stag weekend of your dreams!",Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Really?,Kitchen
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes. I've booked us a canal boat near an Iron Age area, and you can go and look at the Iron Age or whatever it is you do, and I'll make us some steaks. And I've sent off for a chess set and I'll learn how to play but, if I'm not good enough, then there's a computer setting. Or, I'll be pretending to play but really you'll be playing the computer. OK?",Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, well that's nice. That actually sounds fun. Unfortunately, as I said, I think I might not be getting married, after all.",Kitchen
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,Oh?,Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, Sophie's twigged something's ""not right"" and she's arranged for us to see a relationship counsellor.",Kitchen
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, and yet you seem excited because...?",Kitchen
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Because it's all gonna come out! The whole disgusting mess. She'll wheedle it all out. It'll take hours to break me down but then it'll all spill out and Sophie won't be able to shout at me because there'll be a professional there. And none of it's even my fault! It's all my so-called subconscious.,Kitchen
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,"I want you both to relax. This is just a safe place where I'm going to listen to whatever you have to say, however you want to say it...",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh yeah, here we are. The Field of Screams, the torture chamber. The emotional dungeon.",Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,"You've got this wedding coming up, how are you both feeling?",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,"Oh, she is good. Here it comes, let it all flood out. Just, gently.",Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,Mark?,Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,"Me? Oh, I'm feeling pretty positive. Obviously, some tiny doubts...",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Mark,Don't overdo it.,Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,...mainly about the catering.,Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,"Well, that seems perfectly normal.",Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Sophie,"Sophie, how about you?",Therapist's
4,5,Sophie,Counsellor,"Um, well, I just wish I felt that comfortable...",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Hold on, is that it? Is that my go finished? Did she just believe what I said? What kind of counselling is that? She didn't wheedle anything out of me! How am I supposed to blow my emotional beans if she doesn't at least give me a wheedle?",Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,"Plus, obviously, Sophie mentioned on the phone about the sexual problems in your relationship.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,I'm sorry?,Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,The sexual problems in your relationship.,Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,"Oh, right, are there?",Therapist's
4,5,Sophie,Mark,"Um, well, I just feel, I don't know. Unfulfilled.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Sophie,Unfilled?,Therapist's
4,5,Sophie,Mark,Unfulfilled.,Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,"Right, well, I mean, I suppose I thought that maybe Sophie might be one of those women who find it difficult, or even impossible to attain- to achieve-",Therapist's
4,5,Sophie,Mark,"No, I'm definitely not one of those.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Sophie,Right.,Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Sophie,What would you say if you felt that you weren't going to be judged?,Therapist's
4,5,Sophie,Counsellor,"I'd say, I'd say, um...",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Mark,This isn't gonna be good.,Therapist's
4,5,Sophie,Counsellor,"Often, Mark, you ejaculate quite a long time before I've had time to feel like I've started to enjoy our sex.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Sophie,"Uh-huh. Thanks for that, Soph. Great, well, I'll make a note of that.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,"Well, this has been great, just a great time.",Therapist's
4,5,Counsellor,Mark,"Mark, it's all right, we've got forty-five minutes yet.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Counsellor,"Really, forty-five minutes?",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh great, so I'll be spending one pound a minute to hear how shit I am at sex. Now that's value for money.",Therapist's
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,So good to just get away.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah, the Stag Aquatic. So, come on, let's max out the engine a bit. Tear it up.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Actually, this is almost top speed.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,What if we hit trouble?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't think we're going to hit trouble on the Shropshire Union Canal, Jeremy.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, but this is just it? This is totally it? There's not gonna be any waves or mad shit?",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,No.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,Can I water ski off the back?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,You're very welcome to try.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Jesus. Well let's stop here, then, and go for a drink.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, it's ten in the morning!",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, what else are we gonna do? Just sit here freezing out nuts off, talking to each other? I mean, what the hell are we gonna talk about?",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I dunno, stuff! Banter, chat. Isn't that what you had in mind when you organised this thing?",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Sure, yeah, I suppose. So how do you feel now the wedding's back on track?",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Not that.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, right, not that. Well, what then? I can't think of anything to say. You start.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Hey, is that a kingfisher?",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, for God's sake. If we're gonna talk, let's talk about something proper, like films.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, films. Another hour of my life gone trying to explain to him what The Matrix is.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,This weekend is gonna be one massive dry hump. Maybe the pressure will build to the point where we actually try to fuck each other.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you promised you'd play with apparent enthusiasm.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, well, I'm sorry. You can so tell this game is over a thousand years old.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, it's very sophisticated. It's your move.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I don't wanna play any more.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Because I'm winning?,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, not because you're win- I don't even know who's winning! Here, Mark, I'll tell you what. You piss in this bottle, I'll drink it.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,What? What the hell for?,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"For a laugh, it's the stag.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jez, if you drank my piss, I'd feel violated.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, that is great. You wouldn't even let me drink your piss. I'm not trying to kiss you, Mark. It's liquid waste.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm sorry, but no.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,You wouldn't let me drink your piss?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Why would you even want to drink my piss?,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,For a laugh!,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,What the hell made you think of that?,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm just bored, OK? I'd let you drink my piss.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, thank you very much.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, come on, let's get out of here. It's doing our nuts in. Let's go and get you some sweet punani action.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,I don't want sweet punani action. I wanna take your bishop and grind you down.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Here, look, take it. And the horsey. Come on, man! Couple of pints, couple of hotties, yeah? Come on tiger, let's roar!",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, I wish I lived with the chess computer. The chess computer wouldn't make me do things.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I'm stagging you. I'm stagging you by the back door. This is your stag,Pub

4,5,Jeremy,Mark,They want it.,Pub
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, Jeremy, the whole world isn't Zoo magazine. Everyone isn't just walking around wanting it the whole time. People have a wide range of emotional states.",Pub

4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,Why not?,Pub

4,5,Mark,Mark,"Come on, Mark, turn it on, play the game.",Pub
4,5,Mark,Lucy,"Oh, naughty, you've combined metric and imperial. You might get an interdenominational, you know, from mixing the two measurement systems, a hangover of that kind.",Pub
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Just stay mute, Mark. You're a social freak. Remain in your compound.",Pub
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,So that's great you're in a band. What's it called?,Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Mark,Lucy,"Uh, you know, not really.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Lucy,Mark,"I had a boyfriend till last month. He was a bit hippie for my taste. Plus, a lot of um-ing and ah-ing, you know. So, one day I turned round to him and I said, ""Benny, it's time to shit, or get off the pot.""",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Lucy,"Oh, right, and did he...?",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Lucy,Mark,"Oh, yeah, like a shot.",Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Nothing's happening.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, just forget about Sophie, all right? You're allowed a freebie on the stag. Like Pej in Estonia.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"What, when he had sex with a prostitute and gave his wife that aggressive yeast infection?",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's what people do, just get on with it.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't like her, I don't fancy her.",Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Mark,Jeremy,I just wanna go to bed.,Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Mark,Jeremy,I'm gonna go to bed.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"You're not going anywhere, Mark. You can't say you're going to bed at nine in the evening. You're gonna sit there and smile, and talk about something funny you've seen on reality TV. And stop going on and on about the Euro. We're in it now, and there's nothing you can do about it, so just-",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"We are not in the Euro, Jeremy. So you can have your squalid little night. I'm gonna go and read Roy Jenkins on Winston Churchill.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Lucy,"Oh, here we go, Dad's back.",Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Lucy,Aurora,"Ah, that's a shame. I was looking forward to having some fun.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Dodged a bullet, there. Although, maybe not. My attraction to her is so minimal, for once, I might've been able to do it for hours. An endless, joyless fuck session.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Mark,"I'm not wearing them, they're Hitler's boots, I'm not wearing Hitler's boots. What the hell's going on? Why are we moving? Jeremy can't be up! Someone's trying to steal the boat! Pirates? I'm being shanghaied!",Canal Boat

4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"So I'm not in a relationship right now. I've just been hurt too many times, you know?",Pub
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,Really?,Pub
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"Yeah, it's like I've got a river of pain running through me, from here, right the way down to here. Kind of like Jim Morrison or Russell Brand.",Pub
4,5,Aurora,Malcolm,Dad? Jez has offered to do the shopping run and no one else is fit to drive.,Pub

4,5,Jeremy,Malcolm,"Sure, no sweat.",Pub

4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"Uh, yes, that's my racket.",Pub
4,5,Malcolm,Mark,"I should pick your brains because that's my new setup in Bangalore, a credit call centre.",Pub
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"God, you've got fingers in so many pies. How do you keep track?",Pub
4,5,Lucy,Mark,"Dad comes up with the brainwave and then he hires a load of little people, who never went to university, to work out the details.",Pub

4,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, India. Could be my way out. Goodbye Sophie, goodbye sexual humiliation, hello Corrigan the neo-colonial overlord.",Pub
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,I thought for a minute there you were gonna ask me.,Pub
4,5,Malcolm,Mark,"Pretty big step up for you, though, wouldn't it? I mean, you're kind of a numbers droid, aren't you?",Pub
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"Not really, I'm-",Pub
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, I've entered an interview situation and there's a hand near my cock. This is like that dream I had about Alan Sugar and the badger.",Pub
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,I have experience of managing a team.,Pub
4,5,Malcolm,Mark,"Yeah, but this would be 300-odd employees.",Pub
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"Yes, but I've developed a portfolio of skills over the last three years which enable me to rise to new challenges with ease.",Pub
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Maybe this is a test. She can't actually fancy me. Or a trick. Maybe they're Johnson and Sophie wearing masks, and this is all being paid for by MTV and The Playboy Channel.",Pub
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, look at me drive. I'm Clarkson.",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,Are you sure it's OK to put in unleaded? We always normally do diesel.,Malcolm's 4x4

4,5,Aurora,Others,"Come on, Mummy!",Malcolm's 4x4
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, pissed and stoned in a gas-guzzler. This is the life. Already given a quid to Greenpeace this year, so I'm golden. Not the dog, not the dog. Shit, the dog!",Malcolm's 4x4

4,5,Mark,Mark,Does a marriage count?,Canal Path

4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"OK, great.",Canal Path

4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Guess what, Jez?",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Malcolm's head-hunting for a co-manager of his Indian call centre.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, so?",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"There's a chance, a slight but very definite chance, that I could be off to India. And you know what that means. Won't be able to get married.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,No?,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Of course not! Sophie couldn't ask me to turn down the opportunity of a lifetime.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,Couldn't she come?,Canal Boat

4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Brilliant, well done, mate.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,He's nibbling but he hasn't bitten yet. So I'm just gonna get Gerrard to email through my CV and then wow him with a big pitch.,Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"So, you'd just go?",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, Jez, don't look like that. You could always come. You could start again, find a new career.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I could be your butler.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"That could work. I'd be the Maharaja, you'd be my white concubine.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I could probably live like a king on a tenner a week. I'd do fuck all. Just lie around smoking dope and then maybe have a bit of a go on the washing up before you got home. I'd probably get a record deal just because I've been to Carnaby Street. I'll be the coolest man in India.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,And maybe we can get one small servant.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Mark,"We'll need a servant. These leftovers are from two nights ago and he never empties the bin. Oh God, I bet it's bursting at the seams with used condoms and porn.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Fuck! Ah! There's a... there's a dead beast in our bin, Jeremy!",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"All right, keep your voice down.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,A dead dog in our bin! How has this happened?,Canal Boat

4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, earlier, in the four by four, I had an accident. I mean, the clutch on that thing!",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, right, brilliant. You've killed Mummy. Well, what the hell is it doing in our bin?!",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,I had to hid it. Aurora had me looking for it for about four hours. And she made me make posters.,Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"But, the bin, Jeremy! The bin's for household waste, not beloved pets, et cetera!",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, if I can just get rid of the dog corpse, there's a chance I still might get laid, here.",Canal Boat
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, right, this is sort of like a disgusting version of The Great Egg Race.",Canal Boat
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,This doesn't feel great.,Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"It's not great, Jez, that's why.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"There's no chance of it being traced back to us now, though, 'cause it might've been microchipped.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly. No, all things considered, my career prospects, your sexual desperation, this is probably the best thing to do.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,There's a hell of a lot of steam.,Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, as it turns out, dogs do seem to be mostly water.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I mean, it's going a bit, just not the legs.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, put the legs back on in the middle, maybe it'll burn better.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, right! I have to put the legs back on. If you hadn't refused to pay for firelighters, it would've gone by now.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"You shouldn't need firelighters to burn a dog, Jeremy.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"How would you know? Shit, it's going out.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I've got to get my pitch sorted before I see Malcolm.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"We'll have to bury it, get the spade.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,What spade?,Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,You didn't bring a spade?,Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Do you think I'm some kind of freelance dog-murdering mafia man?,Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, great! So we've got no fire, no spade. We'll just have to dig with our hands.",Woods
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, there are many things I would do to help you, but digging a hole in the wintry earth with my bare hands so that you can bury the corpse of a dog you killed, is not one of them.",Woods
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I'll just take it to one of those massive council bins. Dump and run, just like my paper boy days. Screw you, Murdoch.",Canal Path

4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,Hi.,Canal Path
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,This is my last poster. How did you get on?,Canal Path
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"Yep, good, got rid of all of mine, too.",Canal Path
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Just keep lying till the kissing can start. I mean, it'd have to be a fucking good poster to get that dog back.",Canal Path
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,I might call it a day and head back to the barge. Coming?,Canal Path
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,OK.,Canal Path
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit, gotta dump the evidence.",Canal Path
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you've dropped your bag.",Canal Path

4,5,Lucy,Mark,I like going to the movies.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Mark,"Of course you do, everyone does. Man seeks woman, must be interested in film, breathing oxygen, and converting protein intake into muscle energy.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Malcolm,Hi guys.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Malcolm,"Um, we're interrupting, we should probably-",Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Lucy,Jeremy,What's in the bag?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Lucy,"Oh, Mark and I had a barbecue.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Oh, barbecue, yum. Have you got any left?",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"No, no, not really, no, we were really hungry.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"You have got a bit left, I can see.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"It's really, really badly cooked, we didn't cook it at all well, Mark couldn't be bothered to get firelighters.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"Well, just keeping a handle on the purse strings, there. A-B-C, always be cost-cutting.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Malcolm,Mark,Ah-hah.,Malcolm's Barge

4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,I really don't think it's a good-,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,Oh we've only got cheese and hummus. What is it? It doesn't look very much like-,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,It's turkey. It's turkey leg.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Malcolm,Jeremy,Is that all right?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Malcolm,What can I tell you? I'm no Ainsley Harriott.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"It looks weird. What's going on, Jeremy?",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"Nothing, it's just turkey, look. You see? Mmm, just under-cooked, disgusting turkey.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,Hey Mark! Would you like some?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"No, thanks.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Here, eat some turkey!",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jeremy, it's not my turkey.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I really feel, since I'm eating turkey, you should eat some turkey. It was your idea to barbecue it.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I really don't feel like eating turkey, Jeremy. I'm full.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,I'm eating dog leg. I have definitely reached a new low.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Lucy,Jeremy,What's that on it?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Ugh! There's hairs on it, Jeremy!",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Malcolm,Jeremy,Hairs?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Malcolm,It's just a hairy turkey!,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,What's this? Mummy?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,Mummy is probably the turkey's nickname! It could easily be.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Malcolm,They ate Mummy! They burnt Mummy and killed her and ate her!,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Malcolm,"Look, I'll email through my references, Malcolm.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Aurora,"Aurora, I'll call you.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Aurora,Jeremy,"Fuck off, Jeremy!",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Mark,Guess not fitting my CV onto one side of A4 is basically irrelevant now.,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, probably good things didn't work out with her, she is totally overreacting. It's not like I ate her mum or her dad.",Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Mark,Jeremy,Did you actually have to eat it?,Malcolm's Barge
4,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't know, I keep wondering that. But, you know, in the moment, it really did feel like I needed to eat it.",Malcolm's Barge
4,6,Mark,Mark,"OK, here we go, wedding day. I am heading for a wedding. How do I feel? Empty? Check. Scared? Check. Alone? Check. Just another ordinary day. Ha ha. Very funny. Oh, great, I didn't expect a freshly ironed shirt, but him?",Mark's Room

4,6,Super Hans,Mark,"All right, keep your wig on.",Flat
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"God, Jeremy, this place is disgusting.",Flat
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I know, one pretty amazing unofficial stag night, yeah?",Flat
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, I'm so glad I didn't attend almost any of it.",Flat
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Did you slink off to bed before we did the melon-off?,Flat
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I believe so, what exactly is-",Flat
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Two guys get hard-ons, they put melons on their dicks, first melon to fall off loses.",Flat
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Right and who won, Gore Vidal or Dr. Jonathan Miller? Is that, Nancy stayed?",Flat
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. Lovely clean Nancy all over our filthy, horrible sofa. Things are looking up. Right, the farewell breakfast. I'm making you the last breakfast.",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Shit, the last breakfast.",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yup, sit down, I'm making toast. One brown, one white. White's the pudding, yeah?",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,That's right.,Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, one of Super Hans' quite menacing friends started burning faces in the Mighty White with cigarettes, so that's all gone. But, um, how about a cream cracker and a Ryvita?",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,A cream cracker and a Ryvita?,Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Bit the same.,Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,That's my wedding breakfast.,Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, OK, sorry. Well, I'll just run out and get us some coffees and croissants and freshly squeezed OJ.",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Really?,Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well I haven't got very much cash at the moment and no one round here really does that sort of thing. But I would, if you wanted. I mean, I will. I mean, obviously I can't, but I would.",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"That's very kind, Jez.",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"Hey, Nance, how was the sofa?",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Jeremy,"Oh, fine, Super Hans tried to sexually assault me a couple times, but I told him where to get off.",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Super Hans!,Kitchen
4,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Sorry.,Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, looking forward to the wedding?",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Mark,"Oh, right, listen, Mark, I'm gonna have to miss it, I'm sorry.",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Nancy,"Oh, right, OK.",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"Why are you not coming, Nance? Too many memories?",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Jeremy,What?,Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"Of us, of our wedding. Where we got married?",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Jeremy,"Oh, shit, I forgot we got married. I'm always forgetting that. It is so weird that we got married.",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"I know, I forget too sometimes.",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Jeremy,"My dad's just in town. He wants me to move back to the States. Said he's gonna buy me a condo and a boat, so...",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit, it's happening, she's out of my life, forever. What am I gonna do? Could pretend it's not happening. That's worked for everything else.",Kitchen

4,6,Nancy,Mark,"Right, so, listen Mark, you must be so excited.",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Nancy,"Yup, yeah, a very exciting day.",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Mark,You're gonna be married to Sophie for the rest of your life.,Kitchen

4,6,Nancy,Mark,It's such a big commitment.,Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Nancy,"Well, not really.",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Mark,"But if you love each other, then it's massive.",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Nancy,"Fine, no, I agree, it's great, it's massive. I'm really looking forward to it, all right, satisfied?",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"Bit tense, wedding nerves.",Kitchen
4,6,Nancy,Jeremy,"Right, well, I'm gonna freshen up before I hit the road.",Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, I need to have a look over your speech.",Kitchen
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Kitchen
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"The best man's speech, I need to fact-check it.",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Uh, no, I don't think so, mate.",Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't mind it being risqué, Jeremy. I just wanna make sure it's at least accurate. Also I will veto any jokes about mucus, vomit or excrement.",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I don't really want to.,Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Come on, Jez, I'm feeling very tense and nervous and unhappy and I think maybe worrying about your speech is the reason why.",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,That isn't the reason why.,Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, well, can I please just see it?",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, no, 'cause the truth is, there is no speech.",Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, come on, mate. We both know you're not gonna marry Sophie today. It's making you tense, nervous and unhappy. You're gonna stay here with me. I don't make you tense, nervous or unhappy.",Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, you do.",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, come on, not to nearly the same extent. And what's gonna happen to me? I mean, Nancy's going back to America. I mean, am I gonna live here, like, on my own? Who am I gonna go to the pub with? And who's gonna do the forms for, like, the TV and the gas and the water? Me?! Don't you see? None of this works, Mark.",Living Room
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, Jez, it's my wedding day and you need to write a speech 'cause I am going to get married.",Living Room
4,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Oh, shit, Nancy's in the bog. Jez, I'm gonna puke, where do you want me to do it?",Living Room
4,6,Super Hans,Mark,"Sorry, dude.",Living Room
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, so I thought I'd start with, ""I will now do my best to give Mark the six most uncomfortable minutes of his life. And the six most uncomfortable minutes of Sophie's life will be coming up later this evening, courtesy of Mark.""",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,I don't like it. I don't like it at all. It sounds like I'm gonna attack her.,Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,It does not sound like you're going to attack her.,Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jez, it's blue, put something else.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, I'd have to pay for another opening joke.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Pay? Jeremy, is that from the internet? Are you doing my speech from the internet?",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, that was a ""risqué icebreaker"". Would you prefer a ""conservative icebreaker""?",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, that sounds perfect, now can we please get going? I've allowed us a generous four hours to get to the church, but I don't want to eat into our margin of safety by yakking here.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, I'll do conservative icebreaker, met at college material, couple of middle-of-the-road inebriation gags. Bang, I'm out of there.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, good. You know, I actually find it quite comforting that our entire relationship can be reduced to an online speech template. I mean, Kenneth Halliwell and Joe Orton couldn't do that.",Jez's Car
4,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Oh, fuckin' hell.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Is he gonna be OK?,Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, yeah, he's on the dry heaves, so the upholstery should be fine. I don't think he'll die, he never normally dies.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Are you all right, Super Hans?",Jez's Car
4,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Got most of it in a shoe.,Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Super Hans,"My shoe, my wedding shoe! First my hat and now my shoe.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"You said you were on the dry heaves. That wasn't a dry heave, that was a wetty.",Jez's Car
4,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"I'm gonna puke again, Jez, pull over.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, do not pull over, that's an order.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Super Hans,"You'll have to be sick in this, we're on a schedule.",Jez's Car
4,6,Super Hans,Mark,"Just stop, all right. I'm gonna be sick, out of both ends.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, he's by my cummerbund. Pull over, pull over immediately!",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, so me, hat and shoes. You, speech. Let Super Hans keep retching till he's chundering fresh air. Meet back in twenty minutes max, OK?",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You're really gonna do this, aren't you, you maniac? You're actually going to marry Sophie and leave me on my own.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, yes.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I know why you're doing this, Mark. You're marrying her to spite me.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Don't be ridiculous.,Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,This is you all over. You'd rather get married for the whole of your life than consider that maybe I might be right about something.,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Listen, Jeremy, just get yourself to an internet cafe to cut and paste some appropriate sentiments about me from the world wide web, OK?",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Mark,"I'm not marrying out of spite, I'm marrying out of fear. There's a very big difference.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh, this is not how I imagined it, scrubbing my puke-stained wedding wear in a coffee shop toilet. Still, none of it's how I imagined it. Just wish I felt a tiny bit excited, not like I was marching to the Gulag for an undetermined crime.",Coffee Shop
4,6,Café Girl,Others,Thank you.,Coffee Shop
4,6,Mark,Mark,"God, look at her. I would break my own fingers just to spend one night with her. Jenkins on Churchill, she is the perfect woman!",Coffee Shop
4,6,Café Girl,Mark,Can I help you?,Coffee Shop
4,6,Mark,Café Girl,Can I get a filter coffee to take away?,Coffee Shop
4,6,Café Girl,Mark,"Sure, anything else?",Coffee Shop
4,6,Mark,Mark,Might as well ask.,Coffee Shop
4,6,Mark,Café Girl,"Yes, will you marry me?",Coffee Shop
4,6,Café Girl,Mark,Sorry?,Coffee Shop
4,6,Mark,Café Girl,"You probably don't want to, I just thought I'd check.",Coffee Shop
4,6,Café Girl,Mark,"Right, no, I don't think so.",Coffee Shop
4,6,Mark,Café Girl,"OK, that's fine, no biggie.",Coffee Shop
4,6,Mark,Mark,"God, what's happening to me? Am I really gonna get married? Don't want to, but calling off the wedding at the last minute? Don't want to hurt lovely Sophie. Need time to think. How can I buy some time? Contract TB? But where from? No badgers. Try to get beaten up? I could say, he's got a fat head. Call him a jizz-cock? Not actually an insult, all cocks are jizz-cocks really. Be like calling him a piss-kidney. Road traffic accident? Yeah, that'd kick everything into touch for a few months. Shit, could I? Here it comes. Come on, Mark, take the hit. Keep your eyes on the prize.",Town Centre
4,6,Driver,Mark,What the hell are you doing?,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Driver,"Sorry, I didn't see you.",Town Centre
4,6,Driver,Mark,You were looking straight at me.,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Mark,Must get injured!,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Driver,"Well, you should be more careful, you jizz-cock.",Town Centre
4,6,Driver,Mark,What?,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Driver,"You could have had my legs off, you piss-kidney.",Town Centre
4,6,Driver,Mark,Arsehole.,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Arsehole, yep. Nice insult. Clean, clear and insulting.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You OK?,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, yeah, fine, but bit of a wobble. I just proposed to a woman in a coffee shop and tried to get myself run over.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, right. That is maybe a sign that everything isn't totally groovy.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I think... you're right. I shouldn't marry Sophie, I should call it off.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Brilliant! Let's call this mother off. The El Dude brothers are back! One thing, you have left it pretty late, it will be a jilting.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, no, God, no, no, it's not a jilting. I'm gonna tell her right away. A jilt is at the altar, I'm not jilting.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I think anything on the wedding day is a jilting.,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Nope, at the altar. ""He jilted her at the altar.""",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,But that implies he could have jilted her somewhere else.,Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Come on, we need to get Super Hans and go.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,Nancy! Hello?,Town Centre
4,6,Nancy,Jeremy,"Hi, Jeremy, I've just had a big bust up with my dad. I wanna come hang out with you at the wedding. Can you pick me up? I'm at the Heathrow Hilton.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Nancy,"Brilliant, all right, hold on. I'll be right there.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, let's go. Fuck Super Hans, he'll be fine. Let's leave him.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Do you think we can leave him in that toilet, lying in his various liquids?",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, obviously it's not what either of us would ideally like to do.",Town Centre
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No one wanted to drop the bomb on Hiroshima, but in the end it probably saved more lives than if they hadn't.",Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Exactly.,Town Centre
4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Pretty straightforward conflict here, he wants us to go to the wedding, I want to see Nancy. But I'm the one holding the wheel.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, wrong way, mate.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, it's a short cut.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,That's not possible.,Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"All right, look, we're just making a little detour. Nancy wants to come to the wedding. We'll just nip over to Heathrow...",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Nancy? No Jez, I need to see Sophie.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Just tell her on the phone.,Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, no. Cancelling the wedding on the day is one thing. Doing it over the phone, that's over the line. That's despicable.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I really don't think that's a distinction as big in reality as it is in your mind, Mark.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, we are going to see Sophie.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,We're going to Nancy's.,Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look Jez, Nancy's bullshit, she doesn't love you.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You're a love rat. One hour isn't gonna make any fucking difference.,Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"It is, I'm not gonna be known as Mark the jilter for the rest of my life.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, we're in the middle of the road. You're gonna get us killed for the sake of your legacy. Stop it! You're not fucking Blair!",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, release the wheel.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"All right, fine, bloody hell. Let's go and give Sophie a nice timely jilting.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Thank you.,Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"For the record, Nancy's not bullshit. She does love me.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, sure, and I'm not a love rat.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, of course not.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Still, good to clear the air.",Jez's Car
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, I'm glad we've cleared the air.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Lovely, clear air.",Jez's Car
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, here we are, the House of Pain.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh my God. Guess what? Nancy's coming after all, Super Hans is giving her a lift on Chemical Kev's moped. He's only bloody come through for me. Count the kisses, Mark. She's happy and she wants to kiss me, four times.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Brilliant, except of course, I am about to cancel the wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, but on the plus side, Nancy's gonna be there, probably in a lovely dress.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, God, look at it, Jez. Look at all the wedding stuff. Everyone's getting ready for a wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, you did basically arrange a wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Shit, Jez, I don't think I can do it. I don't think I have a good enough reason to call off this wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I know a reason.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I've got a reason, for you not to marry Sophie. But you have to promise you won't be angry with me.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What is it? Did you get off with her?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, God, something else. But you've got to promise not to be angry.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, I promise. Release the gold.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK. Well, actually, I did get off with her. I snogged her at the JLB conference.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,What? You're kidding! You're my best friend and you copped off with my fiancée? You lovely bastard! This is dynamite! This is the perfect excuse! Why the hell didn't you tell me about this earlier?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, I thought you might be angry.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I am angry, very angry, but also incredibly relieved. It's difficult to express both emotions at once.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, I am very sorry.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"You're not just saying this? You wouldn't just make this up, would you? To try to keep me happy?",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, course not.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, this is sweet. I am out of this, no questions asked. You shitty, faithless, backstabbing beauty.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Hello, Mark...",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Jeremy,Jeremy.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,"Hello, Penny. Where's Sophie?",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"She's upstairs getting her hair done, why?",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,I just need to see her.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"You can't see the bride, it's bad luck.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,I need to see her immediately.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,Why?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,Something massive has come up.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,Maybe I can sort it out.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,You can't. Let me through.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,What do you want?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,"Sophie was unfaithful. She had an affair, with Jeremy. I need to talk to Sophie about the whole wedding.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Jeremy,You two had an affair?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Penny,"Well, sorry, yeah, we did a bit.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Jeremy,"God, that's-",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Penny,"I mean, not really an actual affair. We had a snog. I mean, these things happen, Penny. We were both very drunk.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Mark, a snog is not an affair.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,"Well, in my eyes, I'm afraid she's been unfaithful. She broke a sacred bond, sort of like a... whore.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Mark, you've come here to talk about the whole wedding because of a drunken snog?",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,It was a breach of trust.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Oh, come on, Mark!",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Jeremy,Did you even use tongues?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Jeremy,Penny,"A bit of tongues, not much.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,You see?,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,Nevertheless-,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Penny,Mark,"Nerves are perfectly natural, but everyone's arriving. It's gonna be a wonderful day. You'll be very happy. But if you really want to go in there and talk to Sophie about calling it off because of a silly drunken snog, then go on, do it.",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Penny,See you at the church.,Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Why couldn't you at least have said you'd fucked her, eh? Would that have been so very hard?",Chapman Homestead
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"How the hell has it come to this? This is wrong, this is terribly wrong.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So, what do you reckon? Are you getting married or not?",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know. I don't wanna end up on my own, like Miss Havisham, wanking into a flannel. But I do feel very strongly that it's not right. There are strong arguments on both sides. It's a moot point. This wedding is moot!",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"It can't be moot, you can't have a moot wedding. You need to decide man. I mean personally I think we should leave a note and get the fuck out.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I just don't know, Jez.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, well, you need to decide 'cause I'm going for a piss.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, this is gonna be horrible. Obviously he's gonna get married, and he'll never let me forget the kiss, and Sophie will never forgive me for telling him. Am I actually going to piss on the church? It'd be quite a statement. Yeah, baby, here I go. Richard Dawkins walks the walk, but he does he actually follow through with an actual act of piss? Oh, shit! Sophie's dad! Didn't even get to bloody wee. Typical, it's all, him, him, him.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Sophie's dad's coming!,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Shit, hide!",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,What? Why?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I need to think. I can't talk to the dad, Jeremy. I'm wrestling with the biggest fucking decision of my life and he's gonna wanna talk about buttonholes and the parking situation, which to be fair, is a bit of a nightmare.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"But what about my piss? I really need to wee, Mark.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Forget it, Jez. Hold it in.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, ""Hold it in"", he says. This is like a Japanese game show. Next he'll put an octopus over my face.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, we're safe up here.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Were you praying just then?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, of course not. I was just kneeling. Having a nice little kneel.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"God, I am dying for a piss. I feel like someone's inflating a balloon full of urine inside me, and not in a good way.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Shit, there's Mum and Dad. Maybe I should, It would still be OK to go down there now, just, wouldn't it? I could say I was looking for God up here. It might not be bad to look like I've gone a tiny bit mad.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Where's Nancy? Why still no lovely Nancy? Oh, fuck! Sophie!",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, my God. There she is. She looks so beautiful. How many missed calls have you got?",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Twenty-eight.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"That's bullshit, I've got seventy-three. Right. Shit, I need to sort this. I mean, what am I gonna do? What's gonna happen here? 'Cause personally, I have no idea.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I really need to get to a urinal, Mark.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Do you know what? I think I might toss a coin. I think tossing a coin might be the best available route open to me right now.,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You are joking?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Why not? I don't seem to have any other ideas. OK so, heads, I marry, lifetime of potential grinding resentment. Tails, I stay here, become a social outcast and turn my back on the woman I may very well love.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I'm excited.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm kind of excited too, so... Urgh, it's marry. I'm gonna marry, shit.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Best of three?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, exactly, best of three. Oh, heads again, shit.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Best of five?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, the coin has spoken.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Great, let's get out of here. I am busting.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, I'm not getting married.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You're over-ruling the coin?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, the coin isn't actually the boss of me, Jeremy. And how I felt when it told me to marry makes me think I definitely shouldn't. So, text everyone, text everyone to tell them that.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,A text?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yup, tell them, tell them I'm doing a Stephen Fry. We're in Brussels. I'm eating chips and mayonnaise. I'm on the edge. You found a blanket under the garage door and I'm wearing an overcoat and no one should approach me. And I'll be back in a couple of weeks and everything's fine. Maybe we'll have a wedding in a couple of weeks. But I'm on the edge, stress that. Everyone needs to be kind to me. Text that.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You want me to send all that to everyone?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,I'll cover the cost.,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, fine, man, but first I can't go on any longer. My bladder, I'm busting.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do, is there?",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Let me piss in that prayer bucket.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Prayer bucket? There's no such thing as- that's just a bucket.,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, I'm gonna creep up to the bucket.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, no, no, you can't move.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,What am I gonna do then? I can't hold on.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"If you really can't hold it in, then you'll just have to piss yourself.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,You're telling me to piss myself?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, if you've got to go, piss yourself.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Is this what it's come to?,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, and do it quietly.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Great and what shall I do after I've pissed myself? Fuck myself? Eat myself? You're such a-,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Are you doing it already?,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, I'm doing it already. I'm so pathetic that as soon as you ordered me to piss myself, I started the procedure. This is what you've done. You've ground down my sense of self-worth over the years. I hope you're proud.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,When are you gonna stop?,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Not for a bit.,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Stop, Jeremy. Stop it, it's going down the cracks.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,I can't stop!,Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,Stop!,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, ""piss yourself"", ""stop pissing yourself"", it's not that simple! The floodgates are open!",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,I'm ordering you to stop!,Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"You're being a real dick about this, aren't you?",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit! Oh, my God! This has gotta be a dream. Nothing this bad could ever happen in reality.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,What am I gonna do? Throw myself off?,Church
4,6,Mark,Others,"Surprise! Hello, it's me. Look, I've surprised you. What a brilliant joke.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Others,"And so, in a sense, Sophie and Mark, here before us, are not just marrying each other, but marrying all of us today. Under God's watchful eye...",Church
4,6,Sophie,Mark,"Are you sure you want to do this, Mark?",Church
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"Of course, of course I want to do this, this is great.",Church
4,6,Sophie,Mark,It's just with the hiding-,Church
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"I wasn't hiding, Sophie. It was a stag thing and it really, really worked. Everyone was so surprised, especially you. Brilliant.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Others,"But first I am required to ask anyone present who knows a reason why these persons may not lawfully marry, to declare it now.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh please, someone, save me! Jeremy? Spacemen?",Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,"The vows you are about to take are to be made in the name of God, who is judge of all and knows all the secrets of our hearts.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"He's ladling it on now. Is that the proper thing? He hasn't just put that in to needle me, has he? Oh, great, now she's crying and I probably look like a wife beater. It's not fair! I'm unhappy too.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,Will you take Sophie Hortensia Chapman-,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Hortensia? Oh, this is a fucking disaster. Look at me, I'm one of those men women read about in their magazines.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,"...love and protect her, and forsaking all others be faithful to her as long as you both shall live?",Church
4,6,Mark,Vicar,I- I will.,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"That's it, I've ruined it. I've ruined my life. You only get one life and I've ruined mine.",Church
4,6,Vicar,Sophie,...as long as you both shall live?,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,Please don't say I will.,Church
4,6,Sophie,Vicar,I will.,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,Ugh!,Church
4,6,Vicar,Mark,Then I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.,Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Tears of joy, they're tears of joy. That's the line we both stick to, now and for the rest of our miserable lives.",Church
4,6,Mark,Mark,"So, I've done it, I'm married. If only New Labour hadn't abolished the tax advantages, I'd have something positive to cling on to right now.",Church
4,6,Mark,Ian,"Ow, look, you could really- some of it's going on Sophie, guys, please!",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Ian,"Come on! He got married, didn't he? Leave him alone.",Church
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Thanks. Thanks, Jez. I'll see you at the reception.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"OK. It'll be all right, mate. You can still come round. I'll keep your room just the same, like if you'd died.",Church
4,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, it's happened, he's gone. I'm on my own. This is a disaster. I need to take stock. I need to reassess. I need to find someone who can sell me some weed. Where's Nancy? Her lovely face always makes- Oh, fuck!",Church
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"Well, that was... that was one to tell our grandchildren about.",Limo
4,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh, God, more crying.",Limo
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"Oh come on, Sophie. You're worried about the caterers, aren't you? Not everyone will go for the tuna.",Limo
4,6,Sophie,Mark,I just feel terrible. I feel like I've been shot in the stomach.,Limo
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"Don't say that, Sophs. It's done now. We're over the hump.",Limo
4,6,Sophie,Mark,"The hump? Our wedding, the hump! Stop the car! I just wanna go and scrub it all out.",Limo
4,6,Mark,Sophie,"It's not that easy, Soph. That was the Church of England marriage service, not applying for a Nectar card.",Limo
4,6,Sophie,Mark,"Whatever, divorce, annulled. I can't... this isn't what I want. He's horrible!",Limo
4,6,Mark,Mark,"That's it, I'm alone. Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up in my bed alone. Unless, I hire a prostitute, just for the night? Kind of like a wedding present.",Limo
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Are you OK, man?",Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Me? Yeah, good. No, feeling pretty good.",Limo
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,Do you want some company?,Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"That'd be nice. You know, you do smell really quite strongly of piss.",Limo
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"And your hat and shoes smell of puke. So I guess neither of us are exactly the king, are we?",Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, what now? Back to the flat?",Limo
4,6,Jeremy,Others,Drive on!,Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"So, Nancy, did she not show up?",Limo
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No, she did. With Super Hans. So, that's nice. I think I might divorce her, see how she likes that.",Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, I suppose I should apologise for not letting you go and get her.",Limo
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, I was pretty pissed off about that. But, I was thinking of waiting for a bit before I brought it up.",Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, that's nice. Thanks, man.",Limo
4,6,Jeremy,Mark,"It's fine, I'll just chuck it in with all my other mouldering resentments.",Limo
4,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly, stick it on the bill.",Limo
