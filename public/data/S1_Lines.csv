1,2,Mark,Others,"Hey! Hey, there! Feeling better now, are we? Fully recovered? Hey, I see you! I see you! He used to have a limp! I mean, he pretended to have a limp. He's a faking little peg-leg!",JLB
1,2,Mark,Jeff,"Hi, Jeff.",JLB
1,2,Mark,Mark,"Well, fuck you if you're not doing small talk, I'm not going to help us out. Let's die together.",JLB
1,2,Jeff,Mark, And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like I like you.,JLB
1,3,Mark,Mark," Life's all pain. Pain, rejection and gloom. Why do we even pretend there's anything other than a yawning blankness at the heart of, Hey! 33% extra free. I am doing excellent shopping. My depressed state of mind means I am being even more frugal than normal.",Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Mark!,Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Hey Jeremy.,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,You do realize tinned food is just for crackheads and wars.,Supermarket

1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, it's first pressing, or do you want to wait until everyone else has had their fun with the olives? Fourth pressing, yeah, like that's going to be a party in your mouth. I don't think.",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Look Jeremy, we've been through this before. I do the joint shopping solo because I don't make impulse purchases and I'm less swayed by the power of…",Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Mark! I'm not shopping. I just came here to tell you we've been invited to a very wicked party.,Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Do I look like the kind of man who goes to wicked parties? Why don't you ask Toni?,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I did actually but she said no. But it's better this way, two lads, we gotta get out there, grooving, doing it, you know? It's been a long time for either of us. I haven't had my oats in something like, two weeks!",Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Nine months and thirteen days.,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,I mean look at us! People are gonna think we spend the whole day wanking.,Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Don't be ridiculous, they're homey. They're for wiping up mess.",Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, man mess. Why do you think they're called ""man size?""",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Well they're for men! Men's noses, big manly snot.",Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh Mark, come on man, let it go.",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,What? Why do you have to have a huge can of lager that makes you really really drunk? What's wrong with moderation?,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah but what if you want to get Sophie back home? You might want to get her all lathered up.,Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,That's not going to be happening any time soon.,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Shit. Did you?,Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Mm-hm.,Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,And she?,Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Sophie,I mean it's not a date or anything because I've got a megapass. How do you feel about row G by the way?,JLB
1,3,Sophie,Mark,Tonight?,JLB
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, I thought-",JLB

1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh man I'm... but listen, this is the perfect time to get back in the game. You know, two guys, together, out, looking for... it.",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"No, thank you. How much pain can I experience at home with a spaghetti carbonara and Das Boot.",Supermarket
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"It's eight o'clock on a Friday night. Most people aren't doing their shopping now, yeah? Most people are out right now, yeah?",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"That's right. No queues, so who exactly is winning then?",Supermarket
1,3,Mark,Mark,"OK, well, I'm here, so I'll just sit here and drink. No one can stop me doing that. Just drink myself to death. I bet he gets sex tonight and I have to listen to it through the wall. Maybe she might go to the bathroom and accidentally come into my room. And then what? She fucks you? No, she says ""whoops"" and goes out. Stop doing this to yourself.",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Others,"So, safe party. Super safe!",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, OK, playing it cool? All right, how about I go a little Oscar Wilde on your ass?",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Others,"So I always go for the first pressing. I mean why wait until everyone else has had their fun with the olives, right?",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,What's her problem? This is the 21st Century. Olive oil is a perfectly acceptable topic.,Party
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Someone here's got psoriasis, one of the less common skin ailments. Basic yeast infection, rash if you're thinking glamorous, athlete's foot if you're not. A fellow migraine sufferer? Everyone at this party isn't as young, fit and single as they're making out. Yes let's face it, we're all falling apart piece by piece. Doesn't matter if you're single or in a couple. You. Are. Going. To. Die.",Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,Frozen stuff. I don't want them to thaw.,Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Hey! You got Findus Crispy Pancakes. I love them! They're just so... disgusting, aren't they?",Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,Yeah!,Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"So my sister, who's a smackhead, I ended up there for Christmas dinner and we had turkey Findus Crispy Pancakes. That was Christmas dinner. I wanted to kill myself!",Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,That would be the natural reaction.,Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,Can I have a jam doughnut?,Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Yeah, sure.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,So who exactly are you trying to bone tonight?,Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Oh I'm not in the game. If I can get my shopping home intact, I'll be happy.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Just like, be honest about it, you know. I mean, let's line up, two naked rows, best-looking people can pick the best-looking, the dregs get the dregs and we can all just go home early and get it over with.",Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"That, to me, is a very attractive system you're proposing.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"And it saves them having to humiliate themselves. I mean, check out this guy.",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This is great. Knew this would pay off. Talking's bullshit. ""Yeah, I did this"", ""I go there"". OK, there's a new guy in town. Probably just a friend. Yeah, me, her and her friend. Quite nice actually. Hey! That's a foul. Fuck! God, she must be loving this. I feel so cheap. I really thought we had something.",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"So you work in an office and you've got, like, your computer and your desk. God, that is so fucking weird!",Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Yeah, well you know, everything's decaying, so the way I see it. Has there ever been a better time to save up for a very comfortable sofa?",Party
1,3,Mark,Mark,"She's a teenager for God's sake, Mark. You'll get castrated by the menfolk. Maybe she's a- Oh, God.",Party
1,3,Others,Mark,"Hey! Love the suit. Are you selling insurance? No need to look like you're sitting on a brush, man, we're only razzing you. We are the mods!",Party
1,3,Others,Others,We are the mods!,Party
1,3,Others,Others,"We are, we are, we are the mods!",Party
1,3,Valerie,Mark,My brother is such a dickhead. I wish he was dead.,Party
1,3,Mark,Valerie,Oh that's a bit much. Just pretend you need his bone marrow. Apparently that's agony.,Party
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,I can't believe she's snogging him already. The dream is over. I am detritus.,Party
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Hey Jez, I just wanted to tell you we're going... to the Lazerbowl.",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,We're going to the Lazerbowl?,Party
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, me and Valerie. We were going to kill her brother but then we thought it might be more fun to go to the Lazerbowl.",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Me, you and Valerie are going to the Lazerbowl?",Party
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"I hadn't thought you would be... maybe I'll see you later at home, yeah? Would you mind taking the shopping? I've left some stuff in the freezer compartment.",Party
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Maybe... I could bring someone along?,Party
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Er... I mean... I guess…,Party
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I know, I'll call Toni. Yeah, no, this is perfect cause I'll just say ""Me, Mark and Valerie are off down the Lazerbowl. Do you want a piece of the action?"" and she'll be like ""Hell yeah! Why the hell not?""",Party
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,You think so?,Party
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"Yeah, so he was all ""Do you want a piece of the action?"" and I was all ""Hell yeah! I mean this is definitely not the rehearsal. Why not go to the Lazerbowl with the kid next door? I mean honestly, why the hell not?""",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"I've got to take Jeremy's advice more often. I'm out on a date with a teenage goth, smoking pot in the Lazerbowl toilets. This is it. This is literally it. This is the sort of thing people do when they're having a good time.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Toni,I don't know if…,Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Mark,It's good stuff Mark. I strongly advise you... toke it.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,Do you want me to give you blowback?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,What? In here?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, it's the last days of Rome.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Sure, just open your mouth and breathe in when I click my fingers.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,Wow!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,I've been initiated. I am a drug user. Fuck the police!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"This is mate, we're having it. Super nice!",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, the faces, the faces. I feel strange.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Do you? Follow the finger, follow the fingers!",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,Don't poke my eyes! Don't poke my eyes!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,Are you getting visuals?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't think so. What if I lose it? I'm not going to do a poo, am I Jez?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Mark,"No of course no. Look, everything's going brilliantly, right? Now we've got to work together as a team. Work things up into a bit of a lather, yeah? Follow my lead.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,Jez is so great. He's like an idiot savant but not so stupid. I bet he's totally sorting this whole night in his head for us right now.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I could say we've both got enormous cocks, might be the clincher.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,This is great! Isn't it?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,This is so... it! I'm having a just... great time.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"Great. So, girls, what's the weirdest place you've ever... done it?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"I had a steward eat me at the multi-faith area at Dubai airport. God, that was depressing.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Valerie,"Yeah, right. Valerie, how about you?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Jeremy,I believe true love waits.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Uh-huh, yeah. Me too.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,Jesus. I'm kidding.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Yeah, right, obviously, no... me too.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"OK, so, what's everyone's favourite record?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,Jesus! What was all that about?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,I guess she just really likes Sledgehammer.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"I mean, that is a shit song, right?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,Yeah.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,Forgive me Peter.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,I mean it's so... outdated.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Exactly! And suddenly, I'm in front of the middle-aged court for crimes against being an old fucker.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Right, I mean what's her problem? I've never heard of Level 42 either.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Guys, I'm so sorry.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Hey, gutter boy. You are allowed to hit the pins, you know.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,You are?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"In some bowling alleys, you're actually encouraged.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,Right. I just didn't want to disturb them.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,"Well that's very kind of you. You're quite the gentleman. Hey, spread 'em. Woo-hoo!",Lazerbowl

1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Good, thanks. And you too?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, yeah, fine. I- Valerie and I- I mean we just met and we thought we might come here for a few bowls, and I'm high, obviously. How about you?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,I've been with Jeff.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,Jeff?!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,All right Mark.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This should be in the bag. She's come to the Lazerbowl with me, why isn't this in the bag? She looks like she hates me.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"What? It's eat as much as you can, you know.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"No, it's eat as much as you like. There's no competitive element implied.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"At £3.99, I know who's winning.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"How dare she criticise Peter Gabriel! With her little ""screw me"" haircut, and all so ""nee-nee-nee-ee."" You know he single-handedly created WOMAD.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh God, please stop talking about Peter Gabriel!",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,Uh-huh,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Mark,I can't believe it. I'm on a double date with guys from the office. It's like being on Friends.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,Yeah it's great.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Jeff,So do you guys get pissed at the Christmas party and photocopy your arses?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Valerie,"Yeah, Jeff did do that, actually.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,Yeah but that was before everyone else started doing it.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,No that's true. You were something of a trendsetter in that area.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Valerie,"So, Valerie, you still at school or what?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,"She's at college, actually.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Jeff,Sixth form college.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,Yeah that's still college.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Valerie,Right. So what's you favourite subject then?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Jeff,I'm sure Valerie doesn't want to talk about subjects. She's bowling.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Valerie,"Sure, sure, of course, yeah. So who do you think is best in S-Club, then?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Valerie,Jeff,"Oh, I'm not really into them, but I hear they have a big gay following.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"For the worst thing that could possibly happen, this is going extremely well.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Maybe I can just really get into Peter Gabriel and go mental and marry her and cut off from society and just have lots of sex and agree with her about everything.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"I'm bursting! This is why you should stick to the little cans, ah, the simple pleasures. Oh…",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,Having a good night?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,"Uh, yeah, yeah.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,Nice bowling. You seem to have narrowed it down to the one lane anyway.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,"Well you know, it's just a bit of fun.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Oh God, go. I'm never going to be able to go now. Why can't I go?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"Yeah, just a bit of fun. Nice after a lovely Italian and a couple bottles of wine.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"Fuck! Italian, wine.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,Sophie seemed to like it anyway.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,Why didn't I ask her?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"She loved it, actually.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"It's all- Shit! Waterfalls, nothing! Pretend you've finished. Ahh!",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"Mark, can you break a tenner for the johnny machine.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Jeff,What? You-,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"Actually, I think I'm all right. I'm thinking a couple of packs of normal. Knobblies are a bit of a con, aren't they? Maybe a couple of fruities for a laugh.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,"She hates fruit, except pears. If there's pear flavour, I'm fucked.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Tony,"Well I can't stop hanging on for you because I never started hanging on for you! Well, here's the headlines, buddy! I can do who I want, when I want, where I want, and I will, OK?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Mark,This is not the rehearsal.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Come on, clock's ticking. Got to raise my game. Think witty. Charming and witty. And sexy.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,Sorry about that. Listen…,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Toni,"So, fourth pressing, fifth pressing. What's that all about? Why wait until everyone else has had their fun with the olives?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,"That is so true. Listen, let's talk more back at my place, OK?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh my God, I knew it. Olive oil talk. Wicked!",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,So this is nice. Kind of weird but...,Lazerbowl

1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Great, so I was just wondering how you ended up coming out with Jeff.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Oh right, well I suppose... He asked me.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,He asked you? Of course. Is that all it takes?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,It certainly does help.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,I mean I did actually ask you myself.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Yes, but I was already... and I didn't say anything because well, you know. So, Valerie seems nice.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, Valerie, she's nothing.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, right.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,That didn't sound good.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"I mean... It's just... A little nice out. I'm a friend of her brother's. He's a total wanker, actually. So, have you had a good time on your... date?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Yes, I mean yeah. You know what you're getting with Pizza Hut.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,Ha! Idiot! I win!,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Cool. So, old seat sniffer, he didn't sniff any of the seats or anything, didn't he?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"That's a joke, Mark. A rumour that I don't think is appropriate for you to... Jeff's a nice guy.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,A nice guy? You should've…,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"I'm having a nice time so let's just leave it at that, OK?",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,You're having a good time.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,Yeah.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Good, because obviously, I'm having a great time too.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Well that makes two of us because like I said, I'm having a great time.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,She's not going to do it. They won't do it.,Lazerbowl
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, fuck you Lord of Death. I'm still full of piss and vinegar. Mmm, doing it with a sexy neighbour. Ow! That... why is she sucking it? Maybe she's practising for my... are you allowed to say when it hurts?",Toni's Flat
1,3,Jeremy,Tony,Oh SHIT!,Toni's Flat
1,3,Tony,Toni,So I divided them into three piles,Toni's Flat
1,3,Toni,Tony,"Yeah, whatever.",Toni's Flat

1,3,Jeremy,Toni,I think maybe I'll…,Toni's Flat
1,3,Toni,Jeremy,You're not going anywhere.,Toni's Flat
1,3,Jeff,Mark,"You'll have to do something a bit special to catch me up now, mate.",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Mark,Don't let him know he's got to you. Play it cool. Play it suave.,Lazerbowl

1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, come on. Someone get the carving knife and get it over with.",Toni's Flat
1,3,Others,Mark,Do you think I like this job? Do you think it makes it any easier for me spending the rest of night trying to prise shopping out of our frankly antiquated system?,Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Others,"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I thought they would just…",Lazerbowl
1,3,Others,Mark,"I've got your number, mate. I've got you by the shoes.",Lazerbowl

1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Don't go! Soph, you should stay and bowl! Bowl the night away with us!",Lazerbowl
1,3,Sophie,Mark,"Er, I don't know...",Lazerbowl
1,3,Mark,Sophie,"Once they get the stuff out, we can have a little tournament and it'll be fun!",Lazerbowl

1,3,Mark,Mark,"Straight to Frenching. So easy. I bet Sophie and Jeff are doing a lot of talking right now. Yeah, she can really talk, probably boring him rigid about the Celestine Prophecy. Maybe Jeff's bought loads of booze, Sophie could be pissed - too pissed to mind. Ow! She's squeezing my- don't complain!",Mark's Room
1,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,Is she going for...? But I'm not ready. There's no action down there!,Toni's Flat

1,3,Toni,Jeremy,Tony lost his license with mine when he went off with a SCRUBBER CALLED LINDSAY!!,Toni's Flat
1,3,Mark,Mark,"She hasn't said anything about my nuts. She's probably too young to know how weird they are. I'm having sex with a teenage girl! Sophie wouldn't... not with the seat-sniffer. I mean we've got a connection. This is not wrong. Just try and memorise it for later. Mm, this could be nice. A nice, lovely neck rub. She's strangling me! She's trying to kill me!",Mark's Room
