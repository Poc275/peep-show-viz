6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I just need money, Mark.",Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, well, I don't want to pay you for domestic chores. That's why I'm abusing my management position to get you challenging work at JLB.",Hall

6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"There's a script? So I'll be, like, an actor?",JLB
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly, Jeremy, you'll be just like an actor, like Al Pacino or Jeremy Irons. Just tell everyone you call up ""hello, you've been specially selected as eligible for our exclusive introductory interest rate.""",JLB
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, no, not everyone, 'cause if it's exclusive, then... Oh my God. It's wheels within wheels. I've been invited inside with the bean counters and the water boarders.",JLB

6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"So what, there's never been a fire, anywhere?",JLB

6,1,Gerrard,Lisa,"Apparently the reset code needs to be authorised from Frankfurt, if you can believe it.",JLB Car Park
6,1,Lisa,Mark,"Mark, can't you reset it?",JLB Car Park
6,1,Mark,Lisa,"Chance would be a fine thing, Lisa!",JLB Car Park

6,1,Johnson,Others,"Hello! Everyone, listen! So, listen up, I just got in from Aberdeen. And I wanna warn you that you're probably gonna be hearing a lot of rumours, but I can reassure you that Steffan Strauss and the rest in Frankfurt are doing everything they can. Talks are ongoing and... everything's looking promising. But I need to inform you that you're all officially unemployed.",JLB Car Park
6,1,Others,Johnson,What?!,JLB Car Park
6,1,Mark,Mark,"But no, I've just started being a boss! What about my Danish sofa, what about my keyboard? I didn't get to show Dad a business card.",JLB Car Park

6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, Jeremy, it is indeed a headfuck.",JLB Car Park
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Exactly, Pete was just saying a bunch might go down the Crown.",JLB Car Park
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,The Crown?,JLB Car Park
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"You know, down to the Crown, where everyone goes on a Friday?",JLB Car Park

6,1,Mark,Mark,"Great, one morning and he fits in better than me.",JLB Car Park
6,1,Mark,Mark,"Gone, all the lovely power. Argh, might as well delete my spreadsheet of her coffee break times.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I cannot believe this, I can't. They've really screwed us, man.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"They've screwed me, they've diddled you, at most.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"It's like JLB never existed, poof, just poof, gone, so sad.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,Ooh.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"Argh, Sophie, alcohol.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,That can't be good for our baby.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"It's not our baby, can you stop saying that? Ouch, another one.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"You should give her a warning look, Mark. Let's try and give her a warning look.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Is it OK, do you think, to get involved? I guess a bit of one of us is on board. The baby is a bit like our embassy on her territory.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Let's not have a little pisshead, Mark.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"Urgh, the first of many pub visits the baby's going to ruin.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Sophie,"Hi, we were just wondering...",Pub
6,1,Sophie,Jeremy,What?,Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Sophie,"The wine, Soph.",Pub
6,1,Sophie,Jeremy,I've had one small glass.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Sophie,"Well, we both know that's not true, so let's start with the facts, shall we, and-",Pub
6,1,Lisa,Sophie,"Cheers, Soph.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Sophie,"Oh, we thought that was-",Pub
6,1,Sophie,Jeremy,"One small spritzer, half a unit, should I have got written permission?",Pub
6,1,Mark,Sophie,"Written permission, listen to her, she's exaggerating for comic effect, and it certainly has put me well and truly in my place.",Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,"Hey, guess what?",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,You love me and you want to move to Norway?,Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,"Pete heard we're in profit. The German outfit is the one tanking, but Strauss is closing up the UK to save the mother ship.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Dobby,"Jesus, you're kidding, is that true?",Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,"Dunno, it might be one of those rumours you get after disasters, like, did you know no one with an Apple Mac died on 9/11?",Pub
6,1,Mark,Dobby,"But we can't let them split up the team. I mean, you and me and, and, you know, Lisa. It would be a tragedy...",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,if I couldn't see you any more.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Dobby,We've gotta fight back.,Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,Yeah!,Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Hear, hear, it's too beautiful a thing to let just go poof!",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"OK, gotta build a JLB life raft, haul Dobby out of the water. Come aboard, shipmate. Now let's get you out of those wet clothes.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"So I was thinking, JLB Survivors' Campaign Group.",Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, yeah, a grassroots campaign to get justice.",Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Grassroots, yeah, but with me as the chair. Or president, president or chair. Which do you reckon? Doesn't matter, we'll campaign, and I'll write a blog and I'll write to my MP. I might go on The One Show and I've got an idea for a rather savage satirical cartoon. We could do a benefit night and I might do a skit.",Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"You, in a skit, in front of people?",Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,It just think it would be fun. I might do a skit with Dobby.,Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, right, I get it, yeah, the swish of the curtain, the smell of the greasepaint, the rub job in the dressing room.",Hall
6,1,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Oi, oi, 3:40 pm, back home, slightly pissed.",Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Guess what, we both went to work and it was brilliant, but then the whole company got shut down and it was mad shit, we're both out of a job.",Hall
6,1,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Oh, well, more work for the men with ven. Recession, supper time for the vanners, dude. All these big beasts going belly up, we're just vanning their shit out. I might give my contact a bell. See what bits of the JLB corpse there are to chow down on.",Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Hans, please, this is hard for us. I feel that something's died inside...",Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"don't you, Mark?",Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,Uh-huh.,Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Such a weird day for all of us JLBers. I mean, the whole thing's gone. Just poof!",Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,Can you please stop doing that?,Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Why, I'm really, really depressed.",Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"No, I'm sorry, you're not allowed to be depressed.",Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,Why not?,Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,Because you're freeloading on my trauma. You're a grief thief.,Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Bollocks, I really felt I was finding my niche.",Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,You can't find your niche between 9 and 11,Hall
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,Since when did you set the niche-finding times?,Hall
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, the only reason you're romanticising this job is that you'll never get do it again.",Hall
6,1,Super Hans,Mark,"Oi, oi, oi, oi, Byatt, Drabble, relax. Come and have a look at this.",Hall
6,1,Mark,Mark,"Jesus, look at it. I wonder who the Prime Minister will be when I've finished the repayments. An unborn Miliband?",Living Room

6,1,Jeremy,Mark,It's a creamy elephant.,Living Room
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,Please don't call it the creamy elephant. I think I'm going to be sick.,Living Room
6,1,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Hey Jez, listen. If you're at a loose end, I might need a couple of guys, do a job, cash-in-hand.",Living Room
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, the high quality upholstery is like a knife in my back.",Living Room
6,1,Super Hans,Jeremy,"All we need is another guy, hmm? Any guy, with hands, and arms, and legs, who might be around to just jump in the van and earn a few quid.",Living Room
6,1,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Hmm, a guy, a guy who needs a bit of cash, a guy, a guy, a guy. Where can we find just a regular guy, any guy? I'm trying to think, but I can't think.",Living Room
6,1,Mark,Mark,"How did this happen? I woke up Branson, end the day humping shit cash-in-hand for Super Hans.",Super Hans' Van

6,1,Super Hans,Mark,"You're riding bitch, on the bitch rack.",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Mark,"God, Hans is my boss. Jeremy's probably my line manager.",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Sorry for the delay. While I was waiting for the food, I actually sketched out a potential invite for the JLB Survivors' fundraiser. This is just a satirical sideswipe at the corporate culture.",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Star Wars? ""If you stroke my down, I shall become more purr-full than you can possibly imagine.""",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah.,Super Hans' Van
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Isn't down for a duck, not a cat?",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, but it's got to be cat because of purr-full?",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,Does it?,Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Super Hans' Van
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"But, ""if you stroke my down...""",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Super Hans' Van
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I mean it's definitely got to be a duck, because-",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"You're over-analysing. People will be laughing so hard they won't be thinking about what it does or doesn't mean, Jeremy.",Super Hans' Van
6,1,Super Hans,Mark,Where's my fucking nuggets?,Super Hans' Van
6,1,Mark,Mark,I've dropped about six social classes since this morning.,Super Hans' Van

6,1,Mark,Mark,"Boss of the JLB survivors. Yes, probably a lot of organisations got started to bag pussy for their leaders. Charles Manson and his family, Henry VIII and the Church of England.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I've been doing vodka shots with the phone pigs. It's great to see all the old faces, isn't it?",Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, Jeremy, I invited everyone, even Steffan Strauss from Frankfurt, though I doubt he'll be showing his face, not after my cartoon.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Sophie,"You saw the cartoon, Soph?",Pub
6,1,Sophie,Mark,Yeah.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Sophie,Did you like it?,Pub
6,1,Sophie,Mark,Yeah.,Pub

6,1,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, that's right, Soph, exactly.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, I'm not gonna squeeze too much praise out of that dry old stone. Probably went straight over her head.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Dobby,"Dobs, hey there.",Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,"Hi, Mark.",Pub

6,1,Dobby,Mark,"Oh, yeah, amazing, Martin Luther Corrigan.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Dobby,"And do you think I should call head office avaricious profit cannibals, or mendacious bonus junkies?",Pub

6,1,Mark,Jeremy,That's a Spinal Tap joke.,Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,I know.,Pub

6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"How do I look, do I look all right?",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Great, you're going to be great, man.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Thanks, I just need-",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,The moustache?,Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, I'm having a mini wobble on the moustache. What do you think? I just feel, I'm not trying to associate JLB HQ with the Nazis, that would be reductive. I just want to hint at certain similarities in terms of the unquestioning approach both power structures want their underlings to adopt. Do you think people will get that?",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Maybe an Erich Honecker, a Bismarck, something a little more tasty?",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, you've got to get the shit-munchers onside. Adolf is a guaranteed hooter.",Pub

6,1,Mark,Others,"So, what have we here, an ailing patient? But one who is delivering consistent profits, except for 2003. What on earth happened here?",Pub

6,1,Mark,Mark,"Bloody hell, this is great! I've single-handedly re-launched the satire boom.",Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,"Oh, my God, they loved it!",Pub
6,1,Mark,Dobby,They didn't seem to go crazy for the outsourcing IT material.,Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,Maybe they just spunked their wad on the farmyard kettle shit.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Dobby,"I know, that was massive!",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"I'm drinking champagne, I've written and directed a hit play, it's the bohemian dream.",Pub
6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Man, that was so funny. Some of the guys are saying it could be on TV.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, God, what a ridiculous idea, that on TV! No, not without a lot of editing. It really is a crazy idea at its current duration.",Pub
6,1,Gerrard,Mark,And Steffan Strauss made it after all.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Gerrard,I'm sorry?,Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"Hello, uh, Mark.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,"Oh, hi, Steffan.",Pub

6,1,Steffan,Mark,"Yes, I saw the skit.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,"Oh, right, good.",Pub

6,1,Mark,Steffan,Has it gone?,Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"No, and obviously there must be a lot of anxiety over bonus and salary issues, but JLB is doing all it can to help.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,That's great.,Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,Maybe we can chat further when you've taken off your... costume.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,I'm really sorry about the moustache.,Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"No, no, it's fine, it's uh, a difficult time.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,"To me, Germany is Goethe and Thomas Mann and Boris Becker, but it's, it's difficult to do a Goethe moustache. Did Goethe have a moustache, out of interest?",Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"I don't know, um, I don't think so. Maybe.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,"Really, that's fascinating. I'd like to talk with you more about Goethe.",Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,I really am no expert.,Pub
6,1,Mark,Steffan,"Oh, you're too modest.",Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"Look, come and have a chat next door, when you're ready.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"Argh, into the interrogation room with the Gestapo. Not Gestapo, just normal German federal or state police.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Johnson,"So, what did you, um...?",Pub
6,1,Johnson,Mark,"Steffan wanted to have a chat with you about some issues, about your JLB Survivors' group. It doesn't look good, some of the accusations that have been flying around.",Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,We don't like friction.,Pub
6,1,Johnson,Mark,"Their thing is, if the campaign were to quieten down, maybe there'd be a few more resources for redundancy. You might even get your bonus.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Johnson,They're gonna give us what we want?,Pub
6,1,Johnson,Mark,"No, but they can give you what you want.",Pub
6,1,Steffan,Mark,"On a one-off basis, if all this unpleasantness was to go away.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"They want to stuff my mouth with gold, lovely, chewy gold. I could pay off the sofa, I could buy the matching chair.",Pub
6,1,Johnson,Mark,"I told Steffan you might not have the arsehole for this, Mark. You need a brass ringpiece to handle this. The question is, can you put a lid on the squid?",Pub

6,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Heil, Mark.",Pub
6,1,Mark,Others,"Thank you, thank you, and it is great that you could all come today. It's been a great afternoon and we've had a lot of laughs, and I'd just like to say about the JLB survivors' group, and the final salary payout battle, well, it's been a week now, and I think the time has come for us to stand up and say, we tried, we failed, and we're moving on.",Pub
6,1,Dobby,Mark,What do you mean?,Pub
6,1,Mark,Others,"Look, JLB is a big multinational and it's served us all a great big shit sandwich, but what we've got to do is we've just got to eat it down. So let's go forward, conserve our energy, let bygones be bygones, turn the music up, and have a great time! Over to you, Mr. DJ!",Pub
6,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, great, the chopper's leaving Saigon without me again. Just get to the buffet, the safety of the buffet. If I can stuff my mouth with enough salami, I won't be able to answer any difficult questions.",Pub

6,1,Gerrard,Others,Screw 'em!,JLB

6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Right. Yeah, she is attractive. Although, brown rice and Pop-Tarts, chamomile tea and economy vodka. That's a car crash of a shopping basket.",Supermarket
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"God, I really, really, really, really hope the baby's not mine. The last thing I need is an infant cramping my style.",Supermarket
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Me too. I guess it's fifty-fifty. What?,Supermarket

6,2,Mark,Jeremy,The scuba squadron?,Supermarket

6,2,Mark,Others,Sorry.,Laser Commando

6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Twenty-nine degrees, are you insane?",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,I don't actually want it to be wenty-nine. But you've got to give it something to aim for. It'll get hotter quicker.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"No, it won't. It's either on on off. You set it, it achieves the correct temperature, it switches off.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, sure. You set it to twenty-three, it'll be pootering along, ""Oh, yeah, twenty-three? Easy, yeah, nearly there."" Wouldn't you rather, ""Fuck, twenty-nine! Christ let's get cracking! Gotta generate some serious heat!"" And then when it hits twenty-three, we're suddenly all like, click, sorry, already there. And the boiler will be like, ""What the fuck?!""",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"You want to try and trick the boiler? Sophie. That is your first glass of wine, isn't it? You haven't drunk all the difficult conversation wine?",Hall
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"Hi, guys!",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Hey, Soph.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Hi, Soph.",Hall

6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, my God, that's it. That's my in. That's our point of connection.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know why you're sweating it, dude. You should just ask her out, like I did with Dobby.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, just because today was the first time you have ever, ever, ever, successfully arranged a date with a woman does not suddenly make you Alfie, OK.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Mark,He's never dated. He just ruts like a hog.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Sophie, can I just say... I know it's a heavy time for all of us, and we all need to unwind, but... dope plus baby, doesn't that equal career in the Argos stockroom?",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Mark,"It's for my brother, Mark.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, right. Sorry.",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Mark,"Anyway, the reason I wanted to see you both, and I hope you're gonna be OK with this, but I think I want a paternity test before the birth so we know. Are you OK with that?",Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Really hope it doesn't involve anything going up my knob.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,A paternity test? I guess it would be interesting to know.,Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Mark,"OK, great. If I can get samples from you both tonight.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,Oh God. Wanking into a cup. The dream.,Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Yeah, um, here's the thing. It's against my moral philosophy to put anything up my knob. That's just a line I will not cross.",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,This is to swab inside your cheek.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Of course. Now, that's much more civilised.",Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"Yeah, OK, I'm really not sure about this.",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,Why?,Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,"I just don't want my bar code on the database. I mean, the truth is, I have banged a lot of chicks. I mean, that's just a matter of historical record. I mean, he's a willing swab-ee. Leave me off-swab. If the baby is not his, then it's mine. If I done the crime, I'll do the time.",Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"Well, there is a third possibility.",Living Room
6,2,Jeremy,Sophie,It might not be a boy or a girl? It could be something else?,Living Room
6,2,Sophie,Jeremy,"No. Look, I was in a bit of a state, and I had a drunken thing at the same time as you, two, with Jeff.",Living Room

6,2,Mark,Sophie,You did it with Jeff?!,Living Room

6,2,Mark,Mark,How did he get to be the grown up? I paid for the dips.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah sure, OK, I agree, and can I just point out the wide selection of dips.",Living Room

6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Would you like to come in for some lunch?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Er, yes, please. I'm a vegetarian but I eat chicken and fish and posh bacon so-",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"No, sorry, lunch is my code word, for drugs.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, right. Right.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I'm in, she'll never get rid of me now.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Lucky you caught me. I was just going out to check out DILFs in the park.,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, are they in flower already? I love nature-",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"No, not that. Dads I'd like to fuck. They're so cute with their bad haircuts and their buggies and old skool trainers.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"She said fuck. If I say fuck, maybe we'll fuck.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Yeah, I'm not much of a dealer. As you probably have noticed. It's just a friend left the country in a hurry, and left me a kilo of grass.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh God, she's so beautiful. My head's gone blank. Come on Jez, restart, reboot, vibe up. Heart racing, hands shaky.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"That's just, er, I get like that when I hadn't had a smoke for a while. I'm not a junkie. I'm just excited. I just love drugs!",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Where's my vibe? Got to make a connection. Compliment?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Hmm. Can I just say, great temperature.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Sorry?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"I was just saying, you got a great temperature in here. What are you on, out of interest?",Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Um, I don't know.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,Mind if I...?,Elena's Flat
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Sure.,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,Twenty-three. Nice.,Elena's Flat
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Man, she has got one sweet temperature.",Elena's Flat
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Ugh, I hate this boiler. It's too hot. I can't date under these conditions.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"It's a great boiler. It's just got a very idiosyncratic control panel. It's like the Jesus and Mary Chain of central heating control systems. Hard to get into initially, but then, so much to explore.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Does Elena have to come over tonight?,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, yes she does. I've been to hers twice a day all week. I can't buy any more weed, it's killing me.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Can't you go to the cinema or something? I don't want to date on top of you.,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"But it's not a date, that's the whole point. She's just coming upstairs for a smoke. It's simply two very casual people who happen to have perfectly matching genitals.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,Try and give me and Dobby some space. I need space to operate.,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Not a problem, kemosabe. We'll be in my room. Slipping effortlessly from getting high off her own supply to...",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,What is that?,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,Sexy time.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, making love from behind and them slapping the woman on the arse. Since when did that become the international sign of a mutually loving sexual experience?",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,We'll probably do that for a bit and then graduate to some back door action.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Why do you insist on seeing the anus as some kind of human USB port, just waiting to have all kinds of hardware plugged into it.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh my God, what is he wearing? He thinks when you're on a date you should look like Des Lynam.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Turn down! Turn down! Obey my commands, Orac! This manual is balls. Can you turn it down? It's on twenty-three, and ideally I want it no higher than seventeen.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, women are coming. We want to make the women hot.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"No, you want it cold so they have to cuddle up to for warmth. Plus, frugality is very attractive in a man. God, Dobby.",Hall
6,2,Others,Mark,Is it cool to get some lunch?,Hall
6,2,Mark,Others,What are you talking about? It's 7:30. What do you mean?,Hall
6,2,Others,Mark,We're here to see Jez... for some lunch.,Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, there's some children here who want to have lunch with you.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Others,"Yep, cool, cheers.",Hall
6,2,Others,Jeremy,Cheers.,Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"What? Look, I've just bought her so much, I gotta offload it somewhere. Just because I'm dealing a little bit of drugs does not make me a drug dealer.",Hall
6,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, yes it does.",Hall
6,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, God. Come Mister Taliban, tally my bananas!",Hall
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"So this is cool. Nice to get to know the neighbours. I said hello to one guy in the hall, but he was like really old.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"There's an old women as well, have you seen her?",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Hmmm, got to get off the neighbourhood watch.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"So, tell me Elena. What do you, like, do?",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"I'm working part time as a legal secretary. Human rights law, asylum seekers, torture victims, all that jazz. But, my real passion is music.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, that is so great.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, God, she's perfect. A musician who devotes herself in helping losers.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"I'm like grade eight violin, and a bit of piano.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"That's just so cool 'cause um, I'm a musician too.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,What's your main instrument?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Shit.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"I dabble, you know. I toot, I strum, I bongo.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Oh, I love drums. Play me something.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Er, that's that's not a bongo, that's just a small table in the shape of a bongo.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Oh, so when you're not bongo-ing, do you, like, work?",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Danger.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Er, I was a male nurse for a while.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Why did you stop?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Disgust at having to help people in need.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,The white coats couldn't handle my whole Patch Adams approach. I believe a person should be treated as a human being not a mere set of steel pipes.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, come on. I gotta think of something impressive. What the hell have I been doing all these years? Could be a dad she'd like to fuck? Only thing I've got in the locker.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"And of course, the big news is actually that I'm, er, I'm going to be having a kid.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Are you in a relationship?,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, a million times no. No, she's a friend. And she was desperate, and so I was all like, yeah, I'm a very strong feminist, so I believe women should have whatever mad thing they want.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,That's so cute. 'Cause I often think that children are our future.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Yeah! And also, I'm just really into the whole man, baby thing. You know, teaching them to tie things to other things, and you know, holding a baby in the palm of my hand whilst making an espresso. You know?",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yeah. Russian men are all probably infertile. Thanks, Chernobyl.",Jez's Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Oh look, he's hit it. Do you think it'll go in the hole?",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,"Yeah. Novelty golf date beats ironic sci-fi fun, Gerrard. Hard cheese. And we've already had four whiskys, so time for me to roll in my militarised divisions. Makes it much less scary if I think about it like a war.",Living Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Mark, are you about to lunge? Is this pre-lunge?",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,"Sorry, should I have filled out a lunging application form and had it ratified by the FSA?",Living Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Look, don't get me wrong, I like you, but maybe lets not do anything tonight? And when the dust's settled with Gerrard and my other dates, we'll see?",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,"OK, that's fine.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh, my God, she likes me. She just said it, that's undeniable. I can bank that. I can put it on a blog so it's a matter of public record.",Living Room
6,2,Dobby,Mark,"Oh, my God, this guy doesn't know a nine iron from a pitching wedge.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,Exactly.,Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, we are Roosevelt and Stalin. Gerrard's Churchill. He thinks he's in there, but when the fucking starts and Europe gets carved up, Churchill has to leave. Oh, shit. No, Soph. Cancel, I'm cancelling you out of shame. Like my subscription to White Dwarf.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Dobby,"Just, the bank.",Living Room
6,2,Mark,Mark,The sperm bank. Where I bank my stupid sperm.,Living Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,And my other passion is poetry.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Oh, wow, really, 'cause er, I dabble.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Oh.,Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Sure, I dabble. Like da Vinci dabbled in art.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,"Fuck you, Bush. That sounds good.",Jez's Room
6,2,Jeremy,Elena,"Yeah, I wrote that some time ago, but it's still pretty savage.",Jez's Room
6,2,Elena,Jeremy,Go on.,Jez's Room

6,3,Peter,Jeremy,Mm-hm.,Elena's Workplace

6,3,Jeremy,Mark,Balls again?,Living Room

6,3,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't want to take another wank bullet. What am I, some kind of wank shield?",Living Room
6,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh right, I see. So you'll take a wank bullet for Elena, but you won't for me. Ten minutes with her is worth more than ten years with me. Well. I think we can count our friendship pretty much over from now on.",Living Room

6,3,Mark,Dobby,"I know, I'm- I'm really sorry.",Outside
6,3,Dobby,Mark,"Look, you're a man. Men like to look at troubling images of heroin addicts showing their genitals for money. That's hard-wired, like spatial awareness. I mean, it is disgusting and shameful, but, you know, so's the textile industry.",Outside

6,3,Mark,Tourist,"Yes, yes, he did. You're right, he did. Just over there, just outside Jessops, the camera shop. You'd have thought they'd have got a picture, wouldn't you? I'm sorry but have you even paid?",Outside

6,3,Mark,Jan,Was there?,Outside
6,3,Jan,Mark,"Yes. I had a look at it. I'm sorry, but it was an application from you for a full-time job with a loss adjusters? And I just wanted to make sure that you would actually be available to work for us?",Outside

6,3,Dobby,Jeremy,"Shit, then shitter, but then good.",Outside
6,3,Jeremy,Dobby,"Great. I was feeling a bit guilty about not coming. You know I think I've been taking Mark a bit for granted since I started seeing Elena.

6,4,Mark,Jeremy,Uh huh. Maybe.,Kitchen

6,5,Sarah,Jeremy,"You're a very naughty boy, but that's all right because I don't really like nice boys anyway.",Hall
6,5,Jeremy,Sarah,I'd love to stay and chat but I've got to go and give that ill-looking man an enormous drink.,Hall
6,5,Dobby,Mark,"Shit, I was on for a biggie. Is it petering out?",Living Room

6,5,Mark,Sophie,It's more of a sort of gathering that snowballed into a get-together and mutated into a party.,Hall

6,5,Ian,Mark,"I want to get everything sorted above board, Mark.",Hall

6,5,Mark,Mark,"Jeff and Yvette from my book group? What kind of mad social chemist have I become? Oh right, can't finish Atonement 'cause it's too dry, but you've got time to get fingered by Jeff. Very intellectual, Yvette.",Mark's Room
6,5,Jeff,Mark,Hope you saw that depth charge I dropped down your bog. Something to remember me by.,Mark's Room
6,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh my god, there's a twist in the tale. Of course, the butler did it. I'm so sorry Suze.",Mark's Room
6,5,Sarah,Sophie,"OK, so the headline is were not agreeing to sign a single page of this legal ball sack without visitation rights locked down.",Mark's Room

6,5,Mark,Mark,"I don't know? Easter and Shrove Tuesday? What's he- salad spinner? OK, that's not a bad place to keep it.",Mark's Room
6,5,Sarah,Sophie,Now our broader contention is that Sophie is not a fit mother.,Mark's Room
6,5,Sophie,Sarah,What the fuck are you talking about?,Mark's Room
6,5,Mark,Sarah,"No, sorry we don't mean that. What are you doing?",Mark's Room
6,5,Sarah,Mark,"It's a bargaining position. We ask for the whole baby, we get Thursdays and Wednesdays.",Mark's Room
6,5,Mark,Sarah,But I don't want Thursdays. I want to parle Italiano on Thursdays.,Mark's Room
6,5,Sophie,Mark,Sort it out Mark.,Mark's Room
6,5,Mark,Mark,"Brilliant party. Make mine a childcare and tonic. Oh great, reptile abuse. Others get raided by the police. I'm gonna get raided by the World Wide Fund for Nature.",Mark's Room
6,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,That'll teach her to write four or five line poems. Look at all that brilliant crying.,Kitchen
6,5,Ian,Mark,There's another way out of this for us all. If you were to do the decent thing.,Kitchen
6,5,Mark,Ian,The decent thing?,Kitchen
6,5,Ian,Mark,"There's still a remnant of feeling between you. I could make life quite comfortable for you. Give you a job at the seed firm, light duties. You'll do all right on 40K. Living in Nana's cottage with your wife and child.",Kitchen
6,5,Sarah,Ian,Is this an offer your client is on board for?,Kitchen
6,5,Ian,Sarah,"Oh, I think I can persuade Sophie to take this seriously.",Kitchen
6,5,Mark,Mark,"Maybe I'd be happy. Driving the seed van around with my country cottage and my family. Reading the Sunday Times. It's so thick I could not talk to anyone all day Sunday. Monday to Friday, work and property shows and red wine. If I can just figure out Saturdays, maybe it would all be OK.",Kitchen
6,5,Sarah,Ian,"We'd need 50K, and an extension on the cottage.",Kitchen
6,5,Ian,Sarah,45K and the van.,Kitchen

6,5,Dobby,Gerrard,"Come on, let's get you home. I'll take you home.",Hall
6,5,Mark,Dobby,"No, no, don't take him home. He's fine. He's just had a bit of a disco nap and now he's ready to par-tay. Aren't you, Gerrard?",Hall
6,5,Dobby,Gerrard,You all right to stand up on your own now?,Hall
6,5,Gerrard,Dobby,I think. If you wouldn't mind just holding me for a bit.,Hall
6,5,Mark,Gerrard,Oh for God's sake.,Hall
6,5,Dobby,Mark,Could you call us a cab please? We'll share.,Hall
6,5,Mark,Dobby,"The same cab? But you live in Catford and Gerrard lives in Balham. That's miles apart. It's illogical to share, it's crazy.",Hall
6,5,Dobby,Mark,I want to make sure he's OK.,Hall
6,5,Gerrard,Mark,"Plus, late night, minicabs...",Hall
6,5,Mark,Gerrard,"They're licensed, Gerrard. Dobby is not about to get raped if that's what you're trying so snidely to imply. So let's just cut the bullshit, shall we?",Hall
6,5,Gerrard,Dobby,It would be more fun going home together though.,Hall
6,5,Mark,Gerrard,"Oh right, now we get down to it.",Hall
6,5,Mark,Mark,They're not gonna have a better time going home than I'm having at my party.,Hall
6,5,Mark,Others,"Hello, yes, I'd like two cabs please. I need two cabs. One going to Catford. And one separate one going in a completely different direction to Balham.",Hall

6,5,Elena,Gail,Yes!,Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"She said ""yes"". But, maybe she thinks ""no"" is ""yes"" in English.",Living Room
6,5,Elena,Jeremy,Jeremy!,Living Room
6,5,Gail,Jeremy,Isn't this amazing?,Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Gail,This really is amazing.,Living Room
6,5,Gail,Elena,"Oh God, she's the best thing I've ever had in my life and I thought she was slipping away. You can't know how bad that felt. Champagne?",Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Elena,What the fuck?!,Living Room
6,5,Elena,Jeremy,Whoops!,Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Elena,Whoops?!,Living Room
6,5,Elena,Jeremy,"Oh the thing is, she gave me this ring and it was so romantic. God, this is so weird. Is this all right? It just feels so right!",Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"She's so suggestible, like a sexy robot anyone can hack into and program. There it goes. Lesbian kiss, and no one minds. Where have all the homophobes gone when you need them? God, people are so fickle.",Living Room
6,5,Mark,Jeremy,What are we celebrating?,Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Mark,Gail and Elena just got engaged.,Living Room
6,5,Mark,Jeremy,"If it makes you feel any better, Dobby and Gerrard are leaving together.",Living Room

6,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Wasn't it in the salad spinner?,Living Room
6,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,Empty. We need to find him while he's still dizzy cause if he gets his shit together he is gonna be pissed off.,Living Room
6,5,Mark,Super Hans,"Oh brilliant, so there's a snake at large in my flat? Suppose I'm gonna have to buy a mongoose now to hunt it.",Living Room
6,5,Super Hans,Mark,"Well if your mongoose eats my snake, I will sue.",Living Room
6,5,Mark,Mark,"So now I have to flat share with Jeremy and a snake. Still there's a way out, Nana's cottage. The seed van. Could get a dog. What would I call it? ""Warwick Kingmaker""? ""Lambert Simnel""? Too arch. ""Former Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington""? Oh God, this is all too much, this is all too bloody much.",Living Room
6,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, I think I might have a bong hit.",Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Mark,A bong hit?,Living Room
6,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, I've organised this whole party and I haven't had a single bit of fun all night. So yes, I want a bong hit. Light it there and inhale there?",Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Mark,You've been watching.,Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Hmm, maybe he'll become a pothead and he can start buying the stash.",Living Room
6,5,Jeremy,Mark,Are you OK?,Living Room
6,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Fine, fine. It's not affecting me. It's not affecting me at all. Actually, I think I am beginning to feel something.",Living Room

6,5,Mark,Mark,Gerrard gets Dobby and I get a pukey bucket of snake.,Hall
6,5,Super Hans,Mark,You are paying for that snake to be dry-cleaned.,Hall
6,5,Mark,Mark,I bet you probably can get reptiles dry-cleaned. That's the world we're living in.,Hall
6,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh what a disaster. Love is all you need. No, actually, Beatles. You also need a person to do it with, Beatles.",Jez's Room

6,6,Mark,Jeff,Sophie?,Pub
6,6,Jeff,Mark,"Ah, have I opened your Chrissie pressie early?",Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Sophie, Jeff says, he says that the baby is a boy-by. Is it a boy-by?",Pub
6,6,Sophie,Mark,"I did call five times, I left a message. Did you not-?",Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,Obviously not.,Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,Probably shouldn't switch the phone off as soon as her name comes up.,Pub

6,6,Mark,Mark,"He's never gonna be a lad. Boy to geek to drone, that's the Corrigan trajectory.",Pub

6,6,Sophie,Mark,It is real.,Pub

6,6,Mark,Mark,"Ugh, I'm doing something I hate for someone who doesn't like me, in order to drive around somebody who, as yet, doesn't even exist. Great, I was hoping for a David Attenborough-type instructor. He's more of your chain-wanking, ringtone fanatic.",Driving Instructor's Car

6,6,Driving Instructor,Mark,"Bloody hell, you are terrible.",Driving Instructor's Car
6,6,Mark,Driving Instructor,"Look, I'm sorry, but I can't drive. Maybe in your career as a driving instructor you may get one or two pupils from failed states like Eritrea where they have no licensing infrastructure, but basically already know how to drive. However I feel I should warn you that the vast majority are gonna be people like me, who can't drive.",Driving Instructor's Car

6,6,Jeremy,Elena,I think I would have remembered if you'd told me that you're leaving me to go to Quebec.,Jez's Room
6,6,Elena,Jeremy,"Well, if you say so. But I think I did. Look, we're doing a couple of pre-wedding parties for our London friends. Picnic and then the pub. Why don't you tag along?",Jez's Room
6,6,Jeremy,Elena,"What, like one of the group? Like one of your fans? I mean, forget the picnic, why don't I just subscribe to updates on your blog?",Jez's Room

6,6,Mark,Mark,"This is the life. Bit of Shake-y, enormous plate of chips. And when Sophie goes into labour, we'll call a minicab. What's the big deal? This is a much more productive way of spending four hours than breathing in my instructor's second-hand Superking smoke. I could write a play in the time I'll save. Yeah, what's my play gonna be about? A bloke, a genius, unrecognized in his own time. Mark... Borrigan? And he loves, or maybe even hates, chips.",Cafe

6,6,Jeremy,Elena,"Yes, weird. That's exactly the word I was looking for. It's so weird. Weird like, ""come over here and drop your nuts into this deep fat fryer"", ""Oh, OK, ooh, that's a bit weird, what a weird sensation, how weird!"" I'm losing my fucking mind here!",Lake
6,6,Elena,Jeremy,"I'm sorry, Jez. I didn't expect it, but it turns out that getting married is really romantic.",Lake
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,Room for one more?,Lake
6,6,Jeremy,Gail,"Uh, no, not really, no.",Lake
6,6,Elena,Gail,"You know what, why don't you two go without me, because I'm not sure I fancy it.",Lake
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,"OK, I love messing about on boats.",Lake
6,6,Jeremy,Elena,"Um, actually, you know what? There is room, room for all of us, in the bow, or the stern, or the quarter deck.",Lake
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,Chocks away!,Lake
6,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"That's planes, you utter, utter, terrible, stupid dick.",Lake
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Look, Soph, I just wanted to tell you that I was gonna step up with the baby. I'm gonna do the right thing.",Park
6,6,Sophie,Mark,"Great, that's great.",Park
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"The truth is I'm scared. About the baby, I'm fucking terrified. I can't sleep, and I've got mouth ulcers and that weird stress things I get with my elbows and my bowels, well, you know how normally I'm like clockwork?",Park
6,6,Sophie,Mark,Uh-huh.,Park
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Well, right now I'm all over the shop. But the headline is that I'm doing this. I'm driving you in, and I'm wheeling you out.",Park
6,6,Sophie,Mark,"That's great, Mark. 'Cause the driving, I know it seems like a little thing, but to me, it feels kind of big, you know? 'Cause I don't want to go in with my dad or Jeff or someone. So, do you reckon you'll pass this afternoon?",Park
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, yeah.",Park
6,6,Mark,Mark,Only took one lesson and had to pay to get the clutch repaired.,Park
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"I mean, nothing's guaranteed, not in this world.",Park
6,6,Sophie,Mark,"Well, it's, like, a ninety-seven percent pass rate if you did all the lessons.",Park
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Of course I did all the lessons! What else would I have been doing? Watching the frankly overrated ""The Wire"" on DVD day after day?",Park
6,6,Mark,Mark,"Right, gotta try. There's always the slim chance the examiner will pass me because he's gay and inexplicably finds me super hot.",Park
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,"It's great to spend some proper time with you, Jeremy. When I first met you, I thought you were a bit of a loser.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Gail,"Oh, really.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,"And now I think you're, y'know, all right.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Gail,"Well, that's great.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,"You probably don't know this, but Elena and I have had our ups and downs. It's amazing to think we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"What can I do, make a pass at her? She won't be interested, but it might put spanner in the works in some way no one can predict?",Rowing Boat
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,"I'm not much of a sailor, I can't actually swim.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Gail,Really?,Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, it would be so great if she just fell in the water. A few big bubbles and then a few smaller ones and then, poof! Problem gone. She definitely said she can't swim. I definitely couldn't push her in. It would be so much easier if she wasn't a human being with hopes and dreams and clinging, grasping arms.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,Is it cool to swap over again?,Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Gail,"Yeah, OK.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,"Oh, wobbly. Oh, wobbly!",Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Gail,"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!",Rowing Boat
6,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh no, this is terrible! I thought she said she couldn't swim.",Rowing Boat
6,6,Mark,Mark,"OK, here we go, what's my plan here? Touch him up, let him touch me up? Would either of us enjoy touching the other one up at all? No, gotta be something else, some point of contact. He's a Spurs fan, a Spurrer? Could go a bit spurry, spur things up?",Driving Instructor's Car
6,6,Mark,Others,"Oh, my knees are killing me. They don't give you much room for manoeuvre, those seats down at the White Hart Ground, do they?",Driving Instructor's Car
6,6,Mark,Mark,Pretty sure that's right.,Driving Instructor's Car
6,6,Others,Mark,"Right, if you'd like to start the vehicle and drive off and we'll join the traffic to our left.",Driving Instructor's Car
6,6,Mark,Others,"OK, here's the thing, I can't actually drive. However, for personal reasons, I really, really need to get a driving license, so I was just wondering whether there was any chance at all that you could pass me without taking the test. And then I promise that I'll take the lessons very soon, and become a competent driver. I totally promise.",Driving Instructor's Car
6,6,Mark,Mark,And maybe he'll grant me a Nobel Prize if I promise to nail cold fusion.,Driving Instructor's Car
6,6,Elena,Others,Tomorrow's the big day! Gail gets to marry me and my wheat intolerance.,Pub

6,6,Mark,Jeremy,Are you all right?,Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, fine, good.",Pub
6,6,Gail,Jeremy,"Listen, Jez, we'd really love it if you could come down to the wedding. We've shuffled it around, Sophie's going next door to us. There's a spare cottage if you fancy it. My saviour.",Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,Stop going on about it.,Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Gail,"Oh, well, uh, cheers.",Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Pub
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,You seem to be acting with almost genuine modesty and humility.,Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I tried to kill her, Mark. I think I tried to bloody drown her.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,What? But you rescued her. Why would you rescue her if you wanted to kill her?,Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I was thinking, I want her to fall in, and she did fall in.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,So? I wanted interest rates to fall to historic lows and they did. That doesn't make me the governor of the Bank of England.,Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,Who knows what I'm capable of? I could kill anyone in this room with a pencil.,Pub
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,You really couldn't.,Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"God, I'm evil.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jez, the absolute worst thing anyone could say about you is that you are a selfish, moral blank, whose lazy cynicism and sneering, ironic take on the world encapsulates everything wrong with a generation. But you, my friend, are not evil.",Pub
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Thanks, man.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,Shit.,Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,Hey there.,Pub

6,6,Jeff,Mark,"Don't worry, mate, you can always take Soph to the hospital on your bike. Give her a seatie.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,"Get off my patch, Jeff. Take your flag out of my baby.",Pub
6,6,Jeff,Mark,"No, it is tough. I mean, I didn't pass till, actually, come to think of it, I passed first time. Just try to remember not to get into double figures.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Jeff,"Well, uh, no need, actually, 'cause I passed.",Pub
6,6,Sophie,Mark,Oh wow!,Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Yes, with flying colours. It was quite funny, actually, because he said, ""You passed with flying colours,"" and I was like, ""What does that phrase even mean?"" and he laughed and said, ""Well, with a test score like that, I would have thought you should know,"" and then we both laughed.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,Better put a stop to this imaginary interchange soon.,Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, but it was great.",Pub
6,6,Sophie,Mark,"Oh, well done, Mark, congratulations!",Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Thanks, I'm really pleased.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,"Month to retake my test, can't be that hard. Mum drives, the Hamster drives, Jez drives!",Pub
6,6,Sophie,Mark,Gail said you were going to come down to Hampshire for the wedding. See you there.,Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, listen, Soph, can I have a quick word?",Pub
6,6,Sophie,Mark,"Sure, let's drive over here.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,She is a bit adorable. Bit annoying. Right on the cusp!,Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"So, on the name thing, Soph. I'd be basically happy for the baby to be called anything you like, but... Geoff?",Pub
6,6,Sophie,Mark,"Yeah, I hadn't thought about the Geoff/Jeff thing, really. Might be a bit weird. You're doing your bit with the driving, maybe I can do mine.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Sophie,"Great, Soph, great.",Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,"Screw you, dickwad! He's my baby, get your own baby off the internet or by impregnating a woman with your penis, just like I did!",Pub
6,6,Mark,Mark,"Gail and Elena's big day. It's gonna be thirty degrees today, I'm gonna boil in that morning suit. It's great being a wedding guest, you get to be an unpaid extra in the climactic scene of someone else's rom-com.",Cottage

6,6,Jeremy,Mark,I'm thinking about Elena and watching Jaws.,Cottage
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh God, have you even been to bed? Don't you think you've had enough to drink?",Cottage
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Um, that's a thoughtful question. Erm... no. As it happens, I don't think I've had enough to drink. I'm going to carry on drinking until they catch Jaws the shark.",Cottage
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,"The shark isn't called Jaws, Jeremy, the film is called Jaws.",Cottage
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Of course the shark's called Jaws. Here comes Jaws, Jaws the shark, mind he doesn't bite you with his enormous jaws.",Cottage
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Anyway, thank you very much, your phone woke me up. You know what I get like if I don't get my full eight and three-quarter hours.",Cottage
6,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh my life, it's a text from Elena! ""Thinking of you,"" she's thinking of me, Mark! Or at least she was six hours ago. With three kisses! Oh my god, this is massive. I'm going over there.",Cottage
6,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Don't be ridiculous, if text kisses were real kisses, the world would be an orgy. No, it's the day of her wedding, what are you gonna do?",Cottage
