5,1,Burglar,Mark,If she spanners me I'll kick off.,Flat

5,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,Is it AIDS?,Jez's Room
5,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,Of course it's not AIDS. This isn't the 80s. It's the best STD. Just cute old mostly symptom-less chlamydia. And I haven't even definitely...,Jez's Room
5,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Chlamydia? When were you going to tell me, Jeremy?",Jez's Room
5,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"I don't know. Probably I was going to tell you, sensitively, during the next little bit of time. Until he just blurted it all out. Look, Suze, no...! Suze! Don't go!",Jez's Room
5,1,Mark,Jeremy,You can't go.,Flat
5,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, I need to go.",Flat

5,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, if you try anything I will take you down. I'm not afraid.",Flat
5,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Ooh! I can't wait to see this. What are you going to do? Oh, my God! What are you doing? Are you putting your hand on me? Are you having a fight with me? Are you fighting me?",Flat
5,1,Mark,Jeremy,I'm doing what I've got to do.,Flat
5,1,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm going to go, Mark.",Flat
5,1,Mark,Jeremy,"No, Jeremy.",Flat
5,1,Jeremy,Mark,"My God, you are! You are fighting me! This is incredible! You're putting your foot behind me and you're pushing me down towards the floor! Finally, you're restraining me!",Flat
5,1,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, all right I'm not going to hurt you, I'm just keeping you here until the police arrive, OK?",Flat
5,1,Jeremy,Mark,This is- why hasn't this happened before? This is what it's all been leading towards isn't it!,Flat
5,1,Mark,Jeremy,I'm confiscating your keys.,Flat
5,1,Jeremy,Mark,Oh yeah have a good old rootle around in there. You never know what you might find.,Flat
5,1,Heather,Mark,"Mark, Mark? I'm not sure how much more there is I can do here, so I think I might head off.",Flat
5,1,Mark,Heather,"No, no, we're having a date. We can still date. You owe me a date.",Flat
5,1,Heather,Mark,"We've had our date, Mark. We've had half an hour date.",Flat
5,1,Mark,Heather,Twenty minutes. It's too soon. You can't go yet. I won't let you go.,Flat
5,1,Heather,Mark,"Well, I think it might take the edge off the evening if I'm being held hostage!",Flat
5,1,Mark,Heather,"Look, I wanted to tell you something.",Flat
5,1,Heather,Mark,"Look Mark, nothing is going to happen, OK? We're not a good fit. You're a weird guy.",Flat

5,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,I'm his one.,Flat
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"You know Jez, I've started to get this feeling that I'm totally, totally fucked. You know? Everything's fucked. I fucked my wedding, I fucked up my only ever relationship. Everything's just completely fucked.",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,You have been feeling this for a while.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"But now I'm starting to think that maybe that's good thing. 'Cause now I can get on and do everything I've always wanted to do. Join Mensa, learn the clarinet. I could be a scout leader.",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,Mm-hmm.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"What are you smiling for? Look, scouting is a noble tradition. You do not have to be a paedo to want to work with children, all right?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,But it probably helps.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh God, that is so- I spent five happy years in the scouts and I never once-",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,You told me Kinky Layton was all over you.,Living Room
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, all right, Layton was a bit of a paedo but, not in a bad way, just boosting you over the climbing wall, making you run around the camp in your pants. It was old style paedo-ing, before it got such a bad name.",Living Room
5,2,Mark,Mark,"Of course, Layton only really had eyes for Duncan Carpenter, the doe-eyed little flirt.",Living Room

5,2,Jeremy,Barney,Not really.,Flat

5,2,Jeremy,Barney,Oh right. Hi.,Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"We've just dropped Soph off actually, she's going back to work tomorrow.",Flat
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,Is this gonna take long?,Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"Oh, no, no, no. They just wanted me to deliver this to Mark. It's just the tuna from the wedding. It's Mark's half.",Flat
5,2,Ian,Barney,"Come on Barney, let's go.",Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,"Anyway, I remembered that you're in a band, and, basically, I've been doing a little bit of my own music. Maybe you could take a listen and tell me what you think?",Flat
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,"OK, well thanks. Good to see you... Barney.",Flat
5,2,Barney,Jeremy,Thanks Jeremy!,Flat

5,2,Mark,Jeremy,What's nicer than a roast?,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah but, chain-eating roasts?",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,Who was that?,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,Sophie's dad. And her cousin Barney.,Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,Barney?,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"It's the wedding tuna, your half.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, what? Really? Heartbreak tuna? Oh no, Jez just bin it. I mean not literally, there's no need to be overly dramatic. Freeze it. See how I feel in six months. So they came all this way just for the tuna?",Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"They were dropping Sophie off. She's going back to work tomorrow, so...",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Sophie's going back to work! But that's outside the terms of the treaty! Six weeks! Six weeks till we go back. This isn't six weeks, this is three! Shit, I've got to get in there to stop her lies.",Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,What lies?,Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,That I jilted her at the altar.,Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Right, technically- I mean I'm on your side, but technically that's not a lie.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I did not jilt her, technically I married her.",Kitchen
5,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well maybe, but I think what sticks in everyone's memory is the bit where you jilted her.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh shit, if you think that, what's everyone else gonna think? Oh God, I've got to get in there. If she wants a PR war, she can have a PR war. I'll Mandelson her. Nobody wanted New Labour, Jeremy, but now we all know how it works.",Kitchen
5,2,Mark,Mark,"Walking into the jaws of death. Gotta go past Sophie's desk. What am I gonna say? Please save me, Jesus. I'll believe in you if you save me now. The other way, she's looking the other way! Thank you, Jesus! Although it was 50/50 which way she'd be looking. Might need a bit more to start believing. Oh, the gossip mill, that's right, stare at Hess, throw fruit at Hess, pacing his prison yard. Mmm, piggin' tea break, cup of piggin' tea and work out my piggin' campaign strategy. Oh knickers, here we go, Lisa. She's not saying anything! Brilliant! Good old English reserve.",JLB

5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,What do you think?,Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"This is raw. Who is this, is this us?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"It's a simple shit-muncher, Sohpie's cousin.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Shit he's done something there, in't he? How'd you do that?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"I think that what's happening is two, or maybe three, different musical things all at the same time.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,This is the kind of thing we should be doing. Complicated shit.,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Only thing is, doing complicated shit like this, wouldn't that be against the big beat manifesto?",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Have you read the big beat manifesto, lately?",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,Did we write it down?,Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"The big beat manifesto goes, ""Big beats are the best, get high all the time.""",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,Right. At the time it felt like a much more all-encompassing philosophy.,Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,Can we have this? Can we use it?,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Well, listening to this, it did make me think, lately I've been having some ideas and this is exactly the sort of thing that I was thinking of doing.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,He's nicked your idea?,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Well, has he? That's what I'm wondering. Nicked my idea and then done it back to me.",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,I reckon we should invite him down. I think we can teach this kid a thing or two.,Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Until he arrives, should we send this out to promoters?",Living Room
5,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah, I think this is probably the best example of the sort of stuff we'd do that we've ever had.",Living Room
5,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Oh yeah, cause sometimes it's really hard, actually, to do your own ideas.",Living Room
5,2,Mark,Mark,"OK, grab your nuts Corrigan, first contact. There she is, Sophie. Should I go over, forget the spin war? Apologise? Stab myself with a fork? They only have plastic. Oh crying, yes nice. That's going to play very well with the floating voters. Nice tears, Goebbels. Her and her mates will probably start handing out vicious cartoons of me as a rodent in a big top hat and everyone will think it's hilarious until a mob comes round and smashes my shop window. At least I've got off the roast wagon. Oh God, there she goes. This is a public relations nightmare. Where do I sit? This must be what it's like being a nonce in prison.",JLB

5,2,Dobby,Mark,"No, why?",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"Oh, no, just everyone abuses everyone now, don't they? ""Fuck off"", ""fuck off you wanker."" It's supposed to be funny but of course it's not. Wow, you carry personal cheese. Is that allowed?",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,"I'm a smoker, I need man-cheddar, you know?",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,Right.,JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,If you like you could...,JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,"If I was seen sharing cheese with a woman it could be misinterpreted. My approval rating would drop through the floor. Plus, looks like she might gnaw on it.",JLB
5,2,Mark,Dobby,"I'm fine, I think if I ate anything with any flavour in this room my body would probably spasm due to shock.",JLB
5,2,Dobby,Mark,Right!,JLB

5,2,Mark,Dobby,Oh!,JLB
5,2,Mark,Mark,"That's a good joke, she's nice, she's being nice. I'm pathetically grateful. Maybe I should ask her out for a drink. She is a floating voter. Plus, she's weirdly attractive. No, don't go there, Clinton.",JLB

5,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,Think I found someone to do my hoovering.,Jez's Room

5,2,Super Hans,Barney,No.,Jez's Room
5,2,Jeremy,Barney,"No, no.",Jez's Room
5,2,Super Hans,Barney,Sign it and then we can talk about it later. Before you sign it it's all a lot of waffle.,Jez's Room

5,2,Barney,Mark,"Mark, they want me to sign this contract. What do you think, should I sign it?",Jez's Room
5,2,Mark,Barney,Not even sure where you'd sign it. Is that meant to be a dotted line? Who drew this up? A lot of these aren't proper sentences.,Jez's Room

5,4,Martin,Jeremy,"Oh, don't be ridiculous.",Pub

5,4,Jeremy,Mark,Or I could shoot Martin. Or I could hire some Yardies to shoot Martin.,Kitchen

5,4,Super Hans,Mark,Sounds like you were raped to me Mark. Classic case.,Kitchen

5,4,Martin,Mark,You've got Natalie to thank really. She's been very enthusiastic about you.,Hotel
5,4,Mark,Mark,"Maybe that was actually good sex? Loosen up, Corrigan. This is what happens in the bedroom now. No old-fashioned fumbling and kissing. A lesbian rapes you while you dream about your mother. It's edgy.",Hotel
5,4,Martin,Mark,"Some of it's a bit choice, Mark. A bit fruity, death-wise. So you have been warned.",Hotel

5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, here we go. God, we are so hot after the cab. I wonder if I'll be able to do all the stuff she was whispering in my ear. Might need a good foothold somewhere, or a harness. Is this a good idea? Drunk sex with my new manager? Yeah, yeah. It's probably a good idea. They'd only be a problem if there were complications. There aren't gonna be complications, relax. Oh wow, this is definitely happening. OK, got to focus. It's very important for my future career development that I give my manager an orgasm.",Jez's Room
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"Stop dicking around Jeremy, let's get going.",Jez's Room
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"OK, well. I'd like a bit more foreplay but apparently I have to perform on demand. Don't be bitter, this has got to be great. Brilliant sex then novelty bong. Then watch a film together. If Mark's got around to buying a new SCART lead that is. Maybe if we got another SCART lead, I could use it to plug the digibox into the VHS player. Record straight onto that? Or, I could use the analogue aerial into the video, and off that, well maybe switch around the-",Jez's Room

5,5,Mark,Mark,"Jeremy's getting a manager, I'm getting divorced. Maybe he'll end up happy and successful, and I won't. That would be typical. I do everything society demands and die in a ditch. He sits on his arse and accidentally shits a golden egg.",Kitchen

5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Uh, yeah.",Kitchen

5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"So, what sort of stash have you brought?",Car Park
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"What, are you kidding? A band does not take a stash to a fest. You are a V I motherhumping P. Just open your gob, and someone will slip in something tasty. A pill, a nipple. A bit of fried halloumi, lovely.",Car Park
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Cool. What's those? Something a bit red hot for down time?,Car Park

5,5,Mark,Jeremy,You are being rude.,Car Park
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,...then that takes away a hell of a lot of our credibility.,Car Park
5,5,Super Hans,Mark,You've got a bloody suitcase on wheels. Real mean don't get the Earth to help carry their luggage mate. They carry it themselves.,Car Park
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"This is because of Cally, isn't it? That's why you want to come. You're trying to have a pop at the champ.",Car Park

5,5,Jeremy,Cally,What?,Car Park
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"And the brilliant thing is, I've pulled in a massive favour and I've got you on the bill at Life 08. One of the fastest growing Christian rock festivals out.",Car Park
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,Christian? You've booked us to play a Jesus fest?,Car Park
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,It's a great circuit to get on.,Car Park
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,What do you think Jez? It is still a fest.,Car Park
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Yeah, but we're cool. We've got credibility. If we play a Jesus gig, we'll be selling our souls.",Car Park
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,Yeah but Jesus is the best person to sell your soul to. That's his whole set up.,Car Park
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,I vote you go for it.,Car Park
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Well I vote no, let's call it off.",Car Park
5,5,Cally,Mark,"OK, one v one. Mark?",Car Park
5,5,Mark,Cally,Well from a business point of view...,Car Park
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,Well from a business point of view... since when did the roadie have voting rights? I don't come around to your work and tell you how to run your sweatshops in Burma. Keep your beak out.,Car Park
5,5,Cally,Super Hans,"Super Hans, looks like you've got the casting vote.",Car Park
5,5,Super Hans,Cally,Executioner's Bong did a bit of Christo. Now they all live in a fuck-off bungalow in Fort Lauderdale eating cherry pie and banging cheerleaders. I'm in.,Car Park
5,5,Mark,Super Hans,I think you made the right decision.,Car Park

5,5,Others,Jeremy,"Drink, drink, drink.",Festival
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,That is one serious caffeine injection my friend.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Yeah, man. It's not such a drag the fest being strictly drink and drugs free after all, is it?",Festival
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,Word up. We could still get monged. We'll just have to use our imagination.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"What are you-? Hans, are you...?",Festival
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,Head rush.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Safe.,Festival

5,5,Jeremy,Others,"Hey, hold on girls. We're gonna make a spliff out of nutmeg and banana peel.",Festival
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Plus, this shit under my fingernails has probably got loads of gear in it.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"It's great they're doing this. You know, the download market alone for Christian rock is estimated at forty million plus. I've actually put together a bit of research on-",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Wow, ring binding. Laminated cover. Copyright symbol. I'm impressed Mark.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,Thank you.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"This is interesting. Tell me what you thought of the rehearsal today, honestly.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Well, actually one thing did occur. Not wanting to be horrible to Jeremy but Super Hans did seem more like the kind of person you'd expect to see in a band like this.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,He's fuckable.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,I'm sorry?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"It's an industry term. It means someone might want to fuck him. Interesting. Forefront Super Hans, side-line Jeremy.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Oh no, I didn't mean... I just meant...",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"I thought you were a business brain Mark, but you're better than that. You're what my grandma would call a real piece of shit.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,Yeah?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"It's a great plan, Hans is the star. Jeremy is the second stringer. Let's fuck him. That's our dick, that's Jeremy's arsehole. We're fucking him.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Look, Cally. No, we don't have a shared dick.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,Not yet anyway.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,How do you mean?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,Do you want to date? Are you a dater?,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"I have been out with women, so I guess...",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,A friend of mine is doing a little talk over at a hippie shop in Ludlow. Said I might pop in. Wanna come?,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"OK, sure.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Wow, I've got a date. I'm a real piece of shit. I bet those two things go hand in hand. Bet if I got into defrauding pensioners the pussy would really start rolling in.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Oh my God, I'm so embarrassed I brought you to this. Past life regression? What a load of bullshit.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,"It's fine, it was fun.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,People always say they were like Napoleon or an Aztec princess.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Come on guys, where are all the Chinese peasants? Where are the German toilet cleaners?",Hippie Shop

5,5,Cally,Mark,"Hey, check out the crystal skulls.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,Oh God!,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,I've read loads of books about them.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,She's funny.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"They were probably crafted by the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis, and they're powerful centres of healing.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,Is she still joking?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Oh right, fascinating... theory.",Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Oh come on Mark, the other stuff, no. But the skulls? How could you possibly make one of these except by some kind of magic?",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,In a factory? From glass?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Oh, sure, come on! Could you make that?",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,No.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,Could anyone?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,Yes.,Hippie Shop

5,5,Mark,Mark,Please don't make me believe in them.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,Do you believe?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,I do believe in crystal skulls.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,And what do you believe about them?,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Cally,I believe that they were crafted by the ancient inhabitants of Atlantis and that they're powerful centres of healing.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Cally,Mark,"There, that wasn't so hard was it?",Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,Sorry science. Sorry enlightenment. Sorry logic.,Hippie Shop
5,5,Mark,Mark,Well that was great. Apart from the crystal skull sending out it's invisible rays of bullshit. I think that might be my best ever sexual experience.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"OK, I think we have to have a talk, about the whole thing.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,"I'm sorry, the whole...",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"The whole sexual experience. I have to say, that was very disappointing.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,"Oh, right.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"I don't mean to be rude, but is that the kind of thing you usually do?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Well I suppose in general- what exactly did I do wrong?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Well it was better than with Jeremy though. With Jeremy, I had to stop him in the middle.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,You stopped Jeremy in the middle?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Sorry, is this weird for you? Do you want to know?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,"I do, a bit.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,He's like a red setter bounding after a tennis ball. You're like a captain solemnly going down with his ship.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Oh well that's good to know.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,But we can try again. As long as you're prepared for me to tell you exactly what to do.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,That could be a good system.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"OK now, I'm going to take your hand and put it there. You OK with that?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Yeah.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Now, I want you to move your hand around like this this. You can do that, right? It's easy.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Cally,Not a problem.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,Is this humiliating? It is a bit humiliating. I guess the upside is that what I was doing before was humiliating in a way I wasn't even aware of.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Mark,OK good. Lets begin the sex. I'll drive.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh my God, this is brilliant. I'm a sex robot servicing the one. I always wondered what my fetish was and it seems what truly turns me on is being basically absent for most of the sex act.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Look at them all, the Christians. It's not fair, I could be that happy if I believed a lot of rubbish.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"So listen, Hans and I have had a big chat, and we're really into your idea.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,What idea?,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,Getting rid of Jeremy.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,That wasn't... my idea was more throw a bit more light on Hans and maybe give Jez a tambourine.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Look, imagine you have a chocolate bar and half of it was made of delicious milk chocolate, and the other half was made of human shit. Wouldn't you just break off the half made of shit?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,I really don't think that's a fair analogy.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Is that Jeremy? Is he getting baptised? I can't let him out of my sight for a minute.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"Damn, the contract. The Chemicals have read the appendix. I need to get on this, I've got to get back. Look, would you do me a huge one and tell Jeremy he's not playing tonight?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Cally,"What? Oh, no, no, it's not my job. You're the manager. I'm just the roadie.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Mark,"It'll be better coming from you. You'll say better lies about him not being terrible. Plus, real world, I might not make the gig. Pick you up at five.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Oh God I'm the messenger. Somebody please shoot the messenger.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey Mark, I just got baptised. This is Ronnie, he was my baptiser.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Others,Thanks Ronnie.,Festival
5,5,Others,Jeremy,Peace be with you Jeremy.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Others,"Yeah, peace be with you too Ronnie.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah the organisers were pretty keen for me to get it done before the show. Initially, I was a bit iffy. But then I thought, you know, gig in front of hundreds of people. Fuck it. Plus, there's like maybe a one percent chance that the whole Jesus thing could be true - sorry Ronnie - in which case, I got something to pull out of the bag on judgement day.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, right.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Just walk him into the car park and shoot him in the back of the head. I'm Tony Soprano, he's an FBI stripper.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"You know what? I'm really looking forward to the gig tonight after all. If Super Hans is into it, then I'm into it. Everything's finally coming together, and everything's finally definitely going to be OK.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh God, he's on a raft floating towards Niagra Falls flicking through Heat magazine with one hand down his trousers. I've got to tell him.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Look Jez. There's something I need to tell you. It's not good news. Cally told me, she and Super Hans, they want... you're out of the band.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Me, out of the band? What the fuck?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Might slip this one under the rug while he's still reeling.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, because we're going out and she told me she's had this idea. And I said ""no, don't"". That's literally what I said.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"You're screwing Cally? I'm out of the band? They can't just do this to me, can they?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Seemed to get away from the Cally thing.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, you'll have to break up with her.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,What? No Jez.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She's trying to shaft me Mark. You've got to dump her, it's a no-brainer.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"It is not a no-brainer. I'll have to think about it. It's a brainer. It's a real brainer. See the thing is, I don't think I've ever done sex right before.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, you're fine mate. Just stick with missionary. You're a sexual civilian. Leave the disgusting stuff to me.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,Cally's teaching me. She gives me second-by-second detailed instructions of what to put where for how long.,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"That's cheating. Anyone can please a woman if she tells you what to do. You're not allowed to ask, that's the whole point.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, if I break up with her, I don't see myself having good sex ever again. Unless I'm like, going on holiday to Hawaii and the plane crashes, and all my fellow survivors are women sex therapists on their way to a conference. And even then, they'll probably be loads of male sex therapists there too and they'd love that, wouldn't they? All fucking each other and giving each other tips while I sit on a rock wanking and crying.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, all right man. Whatever. Lets talk to Hans. If we can get him on side, then maybe you can keep your pathetic nookie lessons going. So, did Cally tell you about her and me, much?",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"No. God no. Don't worry, nothing like that.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,"She stopped him in the middle. I'll save that for a rainy day, that's money in the bank.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Right, what the fuck's going on? Where's Cally? Why have you got drugs?",Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,Well Cally came through with a bit of herb that Christos keep on the down low. Bishop weed.,Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Cally told Mark I'm out of the band. What the hell's going on?,Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"It's a disgrace. I'm cut up about it. I told Cally, I said for me, this is almost a resigning matter.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Right, so are you going to walk?",Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Almost did mate. Almost fucking did. I kicked off big time. But then I thought, maybe I can work from the inside. No point in both of us getting kicked out of the band.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,But we are the band.,Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Look, all I'm hearing is that you're out of the band. That's what everyone's saying. That's all I'm hearing. Jez is out of the band.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Now you're saying it.,Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"I'm quoting. Look man, I'm really gutted, but me and Tara want to kick back with a bit of Barchester. So maybe you should fuck off.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Right. If that's the way it is, fine. Can I take a bit of drugs?",Band Trailer
5,5,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Love to mate, love to. But this is all mine and I want it all. So, gotta be a no.",Band Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Super Hans,Fucking hell.,Band Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Maybe it's for the best though, Jez. Maybe solo, you can do all the things you've always wanted. That rap thing with Howard Marks.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"I've got to talk to Cally. Talk her round. You can be my spin doctor. Tell her why I'm brilliant, why I'm so essential to the band.",Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, sure. Just remind me again why you are so brilliant? I mean I know why, but it's good to have soundbites.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,Cally? Cally?,Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"No Jeremy, you can't just...",Festival
5,5,Mark,Mark,Shit. He's entering the chamber. The sacred chamber of satisfactory sex.,Festival
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, let's just go. Or you can leave her a very frank note.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Or, we could piss on something.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,No Jez.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes Mark. Come on, it's all fucked. This is rock 'n' roll. She screwed me over and now it's her turn. Let's fuck this place up! We're the hammer of the gods!",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, take that teabag tin.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, no.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She smashed my dreams, let's smash her caravan. Come on.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"I could make the best of it, go for a freebie on the skull. He'll get the blame, I'll bank mate points. I'm golden. Haha, unlucky pal. I win.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Ow, fuck!",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,The revenge of Atlantis.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, this feels good. This just feels so right, you know?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, how long are you going to keep going with the orgy of destruction? Because I'd rather not be here when she turns up.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah man, no. You go. I'm gonna stay. I wanna see the look on her face. Ha ha, no one screws with the Jez man.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Mark,Mark,"Hope she's not too upset. Fuck it, if it's healing powers are so legendary, it can fix itself.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Christian security? What's he gonna do, excommunicate me? Yeah, this is going to be good. Rub her double crossing face in it.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"Jez, I've been looking for you everywhere.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,I'm sure you have.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"I got a call from Super Hans, he's having an ego attack. He's driving to Festivus with all the windows down shouting his own name. Reckons he's gonna make a super group out of Hard-Fi and Kaiser Chiefs.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,He's talked about that before.,Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"So the thing is, do you want to play the gig, solo?",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Well, yes.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"Brilliant. So, let's talk set lists.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"But, there's something you should know.",Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,Am I actually gonna do this?,Festival
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Mark, he went mental.",Festival
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,Oh my God.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,It's a mess.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,What the hell happened?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Yeah, this is classic Mark I'm afraid. He does this sort of thing the whole time. He's passive aggressive. He won't say anything, he just smashes.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"But my skull, my crystal skull!",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Yeah, he hates the skulls. He smashed it and then cut his hand in a kind of... mad fury.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,"God, how could he?",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"Well, he hates being told what to do in bed. He hates you for pushing me out of the band. I was like ""dude, these things happen"". But he was like ""Noooooo"". That's when he did the eggs.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,Really?,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,Yup. He's weird. Twisted. Vindictive. He draws horrible cartoons of you and then wraps them up in sausage meat and calls you a sausage-muncher.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Cally,Jeremy,Jeez.,Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Cally,"On the bright side, he wanted to shit on the sofa, but I managed to stop him.",Cally's Trailer
5,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,First proper gig. Dicked over Mark but that's fine. This is worth it. He's what it's all about. He's having a great time.,Festival
