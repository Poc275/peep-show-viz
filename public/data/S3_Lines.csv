3,1,Jeremy,Michelle,"Um, listen, Michelle, about us.",Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,"I've been thinking about us. You know I'm looking for a lodger, and you and me do go really good together. Well, I was thinking, how about you move in?",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Michelle,"Oh, right. That's interesting, because I was thinking that I like you loads and loads, obviously, but that also we could not see each other any more.",Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,Stop seeing each other? How's that gonna work?,Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Michelle,"Well, I mean instead of us calling each other up and kind of meeting up and hanging out, we could try... not.",Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,"Jez, you're so funny! What are you afraid of?",Michelle's House

3,1,Jeremy,Michelle,"Yeah. I mean, what would that involve exactly?",Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,Anything. You can tell Michelle.,Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Michelle,I guess I've always wondered what it might be like to have a threesome. Is that too much?,Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,Are you kidding? That's vanilla. Let's do it.,Michelle's House
3,1,Mark,Mark,"Tonight's the night, Sophie's actually coming over, for some work. I don't actually think there'll be much work, except sex work. Don't think of it like work. Fish pie, then missionary sex and Newsnight afterwards. Classic. Might make a joke about Paxman and the economics woman. Paxo... Paxo wants to stuff... stuffing... there's got to be a joke there.",Underpass

3,1,Mugger,Mark,Come on! Before we fucking do you.,Underpass
3,1,Mark,Mark,"Do me? Are they gonna rape me? Or kill me? If they rape and kill me, I hope they kill me first. I sort of win.",Underpass
3,1,Mugger,Mark,Is that it? You got nothing else?,Underpass
3,1,Mark,Mugger,Yes.,Underpass
3,1,Mugger,Mark,What else?,Underpass
3,1,Mark,Mugger,There's my travel card.,Underpass
3,1,Mark,Mark,"That's great, help the muggers, what do you want, approval?",Underpass

3,1,Mugger,Mark,Faster.,Underpass

3,1,Mark,Mark,Oh this really leaves a sour taste.,Underpass
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This'll be OK, I'll just do the threesome tomorrow, then finish with her. Bit ungentlemanly but then, it's a threesome, it's not exactly Romeo and Juliet is it?",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,Hey Mark. You all right?,Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,Uh huh.,Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Mark,"No need to tell him what happened, just button up, like the 40s. People saw terrible things in the war, they didn't go on and on about them. They had a cup of tea and invented the NHS instead.",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,...cool mate? If I have a bit of your parsley?,Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Get away, fuck off! Fuck off my stuff!",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,It's just a bit of parsley!,Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I- it's just, on the way home I got... these blokes... mugged me.",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh man, that is unlucky.",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Of course, they target the frail, they smell the weak.",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"So, what happened, did they pull a knife?",Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"No, not a knife.",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Jesus, a shooter?",Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,No they didn't have a... there was two of them. They asked to borrow my phone but they didn't really wanna borrow it.,Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,No?,Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,No. Then they asked for my wallet.,Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Uh-huh. So, they asked, and you just gave them your wallet?",Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, I was in the underpass with these two-",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Gentlemen who asked for your possessions. Mark, you've gotta toughen up. This is the twenty-first century. You've seen Mad Max haven't you? That's what's going to happen.",Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,Mad Max is not necessarily gonna happen.,Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh sure mate, you live in your Hitchhikers' Guide world where you wander round in your dressing gown and have a nice cup of tea.",Kitchen

3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Right so, what about the threesome? What about Michelle?",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,Oh well I had a bit of a plan about that. I thought I wouldn't tell big Suze about Michelle or the threesome.,Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh right, brilliant.",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"It's good, isn't it?",Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, look, are you sure about big Suze? It's just it took you such a long, long time to get over her leaving you. I mean in a way you never totally got over her leaving you.",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,"Well that's just as well then isn't it, because now she's coming back. So shut up.",Kitchen
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"Great fish pie, Mark.",Living Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Thank you, Soph, thanks very much. I may not be an expert but I do my best, and that's all anyone can ask.",Living Room
3,1,Mark,Mark,Just subtly lowering her expectations in the bedroom there.,Living Room

3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Big Suze, my God you're looking great. Three years, yeah? Three bloody years!",Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"I know, and look at you. God, you've changed so much. Although I think you might be wearing exactly the same clothes as when I last saw you.",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Right, what a weird coincidence.",Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,We should leave that for Stu.,Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,Stu? What's Stu? Who's Stu?,Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Stu's my man, my hunk of monk.",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,What the hell do you mean by that?,Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Just that he used to be a monk, that's all. He's just parking up the Golf.",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"But, your man? Because I thought, you know, we- on the phone, there was all the laughing, I mean, I thought... what was all the laughing for?",Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,That was just... laughing.,Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,Oh right.,Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"What's the problem, Jez? I thought this was gonna be nice. I'm with Stu, you're with good old Michelle.",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit, they're still in contact. Think of something.",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,No I'm not.,Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Oh, right, well she just said-",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"No that was just a mistake followed by a series of subsequent mistakes which when you look at all together really don't add up to much. Anyway I've done all that now,so there's nothing stopping us...",Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,We should let Stu in.,Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Yeah, should we though?",Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Stu,Hey Stu-pot. This is Jez.,Flat
3,1,Stu,Jeremy,Hey man.,Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,"Hi, I'm her ex.",Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Oh Jez, don't be stupid. We were never really...",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,We lived together for a year and a half.,Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Well, we kind of did, but in 2002 in that weird flat.",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,The love shack?!,Flat
3,1,Stu,Jeremy,"Listen, can we take a shower?",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,No.,Flat
3,1,Stu,Jeremy,It was a really sweaty flight.,Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,There isn't that much hot water.,Flat
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"That's fine, we'll share. See you in an hour or so, yeah?",Flat
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"He's a monk, he's gonna have fifteen years of spunk backed up. How am I supposed to compete with that?",Flat
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"Wow, this is a lot of candles. It's actually getting pretty hot in here.",Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah I tried opening a window but a lot of them blew out, which I suppose actually shows that electric light's actually quite a lot better, although I know that's not a very fashionable thing to say.",Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Mark,"What am I talking about? Jeremy's sex CD. Better than ""Big Bond Themes"" I guess. Bond wouldn't get mugged. Bollocks, forgot to call and stop the phone. Could go out and do it now, pretend I need a dump. Not very sexy.",Mark's Room
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"So, Mark, time for us to get down to some work.",Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, oh yeah.",Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh yeah this is it, this is really happening. Relax, stop worrying about the muggers and their free calls, I'm getting sexy. Bastards, they're probably going through my address book randomly deleting contacts. That's probably how they get their kicks. Shit, I'm not kissing right. Plus, nothing growing in the pants department. I'm as limp as a charity wristband. Got to stop thinking about the muggers. Be in the moment, Corrigan! Shit, she's snaking up the thigh, but there's nothing at the top of it. Abort! Abort!",Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"So, great. Great, that was great, Soph. Lovely interlude.",Mark's Room
3,1,Sophie,Mark,Right.,Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"But I think we should probably... I mean, this work isn't gonna do itself.",Mark's Room
3,1,Sophie,Mark,The work?,Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,Yep. The bloody work!,Mark's Room
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"I don't really care about the work, Mark.",Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh. Oh. Sure, sure you don't, Soph. Right, now where's that broadband cable? I should be able to...",Mark's Room
3,1,Sophie,Mark,Mark. I know it's taken us a while to get here but this feels really right.,Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Mark,Please don't touch my floppy cock.,Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,I want you to be sure.,Mark's Room
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"I am sure, so shall we?",Mark's Room
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh God I want to, it's just these damn reports!",Mark's Room
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, how long does a shower take? Still, drinking alone, what's the big deal? Why is it necessarily a bad thing? If you drink a bottle of vodka and there's a bloke sitting next to you, does that somehow make it all right?",Kitchen
3,1,Stu,Jeremy,"I'm really parched, mate, all right if I have a swig of something?",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,Whatever.,Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Jesus, that's what a man should look like. Those arms, they're amazing. Like boughs of sturdy English oak. My God, if you had them wrapped around you, you'd just feel so safe.",Kitchen
3,1,Stu,Jeremy,"Listen, Jeremy, I just wanted to say, you've obviously got some feelings about Suze and the past, and that's cool. So listen man, really nice to meet you and no hard feelings, yeah?",Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,Sure.,Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,"Ah ha ha, how do you like that, Stu? You... monk.",Kitchen
3,1,Stu,Jeremy,What- what does that even mean?,Kitchen
3,1,Jeremy,Stu,"You know what it means Stu, from how it makes you feel, that's what it means, yeah. Welcome to big school.",Kitchen
3,1,Mark,Mark,"Who needs to be a man when you've got a knife? Good old Mr Patel and his illegal supply of knives. OK, come on then Mark, T-Mobile gave you the numbers the mugger called, ring the numbers. Might be able to get my Blackberry back and not get humiliated by Patrick in IT.",JLB
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"Hey, what are you looking so serious about there, Mr Corrigan?",JLB
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, just... nothing.",JLB
3,1,Sophie,Mark,Because I was wondering how far a girl like you might go on a second date.,JLB
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Oh ha ha ha. Well, you know, at least second base.",JLB
3,1,Mark,Mark,"Relax, let it happen.",JLB
3,1,Sophie,Mark,Ooh second base...,JLB
3,1,Mark,Mark,"But nothing's stirring. Uh-oh, she's gonna feel the knife. Can't let her feel the hard knife or the soft cock.",JLB
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Look, Sophie, this is a hell of a laugh and all, and I love horseplay and light-heartedness and having a great time, but you know, there's codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures, and it just makes me very nervous.",JLB
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"All right Mark, I'm just screwing around. We're no going to get it on in the photocopying room.",JLB
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Yes, Sophie, I know, really. Let's have fun.",JLB
3,1,Sophie,Mark,Heh heh.,JLB
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"Look, I'm just, you know me, I'm old fashioned. I like courting. Look, can- why don't we go to the pictures?",JLB
3,1,Sophie,Mark,"Sure, should I bring a chaperone?",JLB
3,1,Mark,Sophie,"I like your joke, Sophie, a point well made. A point well made. Later, baby.",JLB
3,1,Mark,Mark,"Urgh, baby. Note to self re. being the Fonz",JLB
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Threesome, oh yeah, here I come. No need for big Suze ever even to know about...",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,Big Suze!,Michelle's House
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Hi Jeremy, here for the threesome?",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Well, yeah.",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh my God, I'm gonna have a threesome with big Suze. Michelle's not some sort of macho sexual terrorist, she's brilliant!",Michelle's House

3,1,Vicky,Michelle,Does he know the ground rules?,Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Vicky,What?,Michelle's House
3,1,Vicky,Michelle,Has he had a shower? Doesn't look like he's showered.,Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Michelle,Why isn't she talking to me?,Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,"Look, Vicky's just very busy, OK? She's not all that sure about this whole thing and she's doing me a massive favour. She'd just rather not talk to you, OK? Vicky, shall we go and get ready?",Michelle's House
3,1,Vicky,Michelle,I suppose.,Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,"You know where the bathroom is. You'll find a bottle of antibacterial shower wash by the basin, OK?",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I will have had a threesome, I will have had a threesome.",Michelle's House
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"So, Jez, a threesome. That'll be nice. My friend Jen did a threesome once, she said she cried for about an hour afterwards but I'd still definitely like to try it sometime.",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Yeah, right. Suze, you don't wanna go back out with me, do you?",Michelle's House
3,1,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Oh, Jez, you're such a nice guy but, I think maybe it wasn't meant to be.",Michelle's House
3,1,Michelle,Jeremy,"Jez, we're ready! Listen, come on, you can skip the shower, just use a flannel! Vicky doesn't wanna miss her train.",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This is great, I'm having it large. It's like I'm living in a porno. Except, porn stars probably get lovely sedatives so they feel like they're not really there. Lovely sedatives.",Michelle's House
3,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"That wasn't depressing, that was great. Big Suze out of my life forever, so what? I'm getting threesomes. Why have I never thought about drinking in the day before? What's more fun than a couple of nice cold beerskis? What's depressing about that? Nothing. You can't be depressed when you're pissed, it's not possible.",Supermarket
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, I've got a lead. This kid says he can get my phone back. I've gotta meet him at Chicken Corner. I need back up.",Supermarket

3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"I just hope, Jez, the drinking, it hasn't become a problem.",Supermarket

3,1,Mark,Jeremy,What's your plan?,Supermarket
3,1,Jeremy,Mark,I'm gonna hit him.,Supermarket
3,1,Mark,Jeremy,"That's not really a plan, as such.",Supermarket

3,1,Mark,Mugger's Mate,"So, thanks for coming. I mean, obviously your mate... I'm not, I don't approve of what he's done, but there's no reason why we can't be civil.",Chicken Corner

3,1,Mark,Mugger's Mate,"I mean, I think, I have to say, this is a bit rich, but I guess, maybe there's certain administrative costs for you to bear and so on, so...",Chicken Corner

3,1,Mark,Mugger's Mate,Really?,Chicken Corner
3,1,Mugger's Mate,Mark,Yeah.,Chicken Corner

3,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh Jesus, I've got to get a hard-on soon or we're finished. Maybe I was too quick to delete those spam emails about erection enhancement.

3,2,Doctor,Jeremy,"Look, it might take us a month or so just to see what kind of drug or cognitive therapies might help Merry with her condition.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"Oh right, I see. Your little world is threatened by all the amazing Jack Nicholsons and Robin Williamses burning so bright you've gotta keep them down with your chemical cosh.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Doctor,"Yeah come on man, set her free. All she needs is a vodka and tonic and a nice little lie down.",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Super Hans,"I'm sorry, but there's no way I can sign her out. She's not well.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Doctor,"Your dream is just everyone on the omnibus, grey, eating grey sludge. That's your dream, isn't it?",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Jeremy,No.,Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Doctor,"We'll look after her. She's just wacky, you know? She's basically fine.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Super Hans,"She's not fine, she's temporarily mad.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, you're with them now, are you Mark? Well tell me, is it mad to be diagnosed with a mental disorder, or is it in fact, much more mad to get up every morning to go to your boring job so you can print out lots of meaningless documents?",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Doctor,"I'm sorry about this, it's the 60s. He thinks he's living in the 60s.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Doctor,"How about this? You let her go, and we promise, promise to keep her restrained, tightly tied.",Hospital
3,2,Doctor,Super Hans,"Look, I appreciate how passionately you feel about your friend, but there's no way I can sign her out. I'm sorry.",Hospital

3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Uh, those, I don't know, they're not important. Just give them to me, really.",Hospital

3,2,Mark,Jeremy,She gave it to you?,Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, yeah. I mean, it's all perfectly legal, probably, Mark. I don't really see what you're worried about.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"But that's... obviously, I mean, she's not in her right mind.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Mark,She was fine when she gave us the pub.,Hospital
3,2,Mark,Super Hans,"Well, are you sure, 'cause I guess giving away a pub that's worth several thousands of pounds for free, that kind of suggests you haven't exactly got your best thinking cap on.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, we're not exploiting her. Once we turn the pub into a cash cow, we'll give her some of the cream.",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Yeah, right.",Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, I just think, in this situation, Merry needs an impartial adviser like me to help her decide what's best.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,"God, you're loving this, aren't you? Holding the deeds like Mr. Monopoly with his top hat and his iron. Do you really think if you don't give us her pub, she's gonna let you screw her?",Hospital
3,2,Super Hans,Mark,Ha ha.,Hospital
3,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh God, that is low. That is really nuts.",Hospital
3,2,Jeremy,Mark,Are you saying I'm mad? Is that what you're saying? Are you gonna try and get me sectioned for simply following my dream?,Hospital

Doesn't sound great. ""Why did you poison your flatmate?"" ""So I could have a party."" But I'm only poisoning him a tiny, tiny bit. It's really a white poisoning, a friendly poisoning. It's just so much more civilised than bonking him on the head with a hammer.",Kitchen
3,3,Jeremy,Mark,"Hi, mate.",Mark's Room
3,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, thanks.",Mark's Room
3,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit. Could this actually kill him? It's not going to kill him. It's just loads and loads of medicine. He'll probably wake up in three days, completely cured.",Mark's Room

Brilliant.",Flat

Just go to the loo and then... What? He's... has he... locked me in?! This is incredible! This is literally unbelievable! I'm locked out of a party that's happening in my own home! It's Sarah's eighteenth all over again. A mushroom party in my flat is not in the bloody tenant's agreement! Of course, I never made him sign a tenant's agreement. Bollocks.

If I do this, even if I end up marrying Sophie and we live in a detached house in Surrey, and buy a holiday home in Umbria, our children will always look up at the face of a man who once crapped in a takeaway bag. Plus, I'd have to hide it here somewhere in my room next to one of my... things. I could throw it out the window. No, that's what they want you to do. That's where society's headed!

3,4,Jeremy,Sarah,I think it's different when you're a musician.,Pub
3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,You're a musician?,Pub

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,You'll say anything won't you? Words don't mean a thing to you do they?,Kitchen
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I think, I think I love her. I think I've fallen in love with her. You can't blame me for falling in love with her can you?",Kitchen
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No, I guess not. It's just... I don't believe you.",Kitchen
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, well, there's not much I can really do about that, is there? Unless you want me to buy her, like, the biggest puppy or heart-shaped cushion in the world. Is that literally what you want me to do? Buy her a puppy the size of Digby, the biggest dog in the world?",Kitchen
3,4,Mark,Mark,"If I don't pay it's OK. If I don't pay it's OK. Oh God. Four hours of my precious holiday wasted. Face it, the day's a write-off. Might as well just carry on. Must be something to puncture my thickening shield of numbness.",Mark's Room

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,Steady on. My mushroom stroganoff isn't that bad.,Kitchen
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, look, I know you're gonna say no to this but I said I'd ask. Sarah's looking for a place to stay for the next few months and I said probably not because it's a small flat and that's your view, and there'd be bathroom issues.",Kitchen
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, no, I'm sure we can work it out. It would be a shame to break up the lovebirds. Unless, I mean, you do want her to stay don't you?",Kitchen

3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,"See, I told you. This is gonna be fun. Now look, I've got all your files out. I've got a nasty feeling your National Insurance affairs aren't in order.",Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Christ, there's a Mark in here and a Mark in there. I'm surrounded.",Living Room
3,4,Big Suze,Jeremy,Thought Sarah was going to join us. Mark told me how much in love you are with her. She must be amazing.,Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Um, yeah, no, she's great. She's on the phone, but-",Living Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh that's nice. That's a nice thing to say. So, what is it especially that you, you know, love about her?",Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,Oh I couldn't possibly...,Living Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh come on, I mean, is she the one? Do you think it will last?",Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No. I mean, I hope it does. But nothing does, does it? So, I'm just being realistic.",Living Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"He's bashful. But, I see brother-in-law material there.",Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Big Suze,"So, Suze, how's everything with your bloke? Whatshisname?",Living Room
3,4,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Oh, we finished actually Jez. So, no need to twist the knife thanks.",Living Room

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, I think your girlfriend's crying.",Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Your sister, really?",Living Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,That was definitely sobbing Jez.,Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Mmm, but she was taking a call from your dad Mark, so maybe if it's family stuff you should...",Living Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, well, even if it is family stuff, frankly I don't wanna know about all the infidelities and heartache. And, you know, if Uncle Lance was touched up by the vicar and that's why he's such a tit at Christmas. Well, I'm sorry but I just don't wanna hear about it.",Living Room
3,4,Big Suze,Jeremy,She does sound very upset.,Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Big Suze,"All right, yep, fine. I'll go and talk to her. It'll be good to hear about everything.",Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Whilst she's talking, I'll just use my mind to think about other things. She can't stop my mind.",Living Room
3,4,Jeremy,Sarah,You OK love bumps? Do you want to talk about it?,Flat
3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,"Jez, honey, listen.",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Great, here we go. This is an hour of my life I'll never get back. While Mark and Big Suze do lovely chatting I get put through the emotional mincing machine.",Flat
3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,That was Simon. We're going to... we talked and we're going to... give it another chance.,Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Sarah,You are?,Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Simon, you are a God!",Flat

3,4,Mark,Jeremy,What are you dancing a jig for Jeremy?,Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, you know, I'm just happy. I just heard that Jamiroquai are playing Reading. I fucking love those guys.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,Where's Sarah gone?,Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"She's off to meet Simon. They're u, they're getting back together.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,You're loving this aren't you? This has worked out perfectly for you hasn't it?,Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No, not at all.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh come on Jez, this is me you're talking to. There's no need to pretend.",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No need to pretend? Well, maybe it's time you stopped pretending not to be in love with Big Suze.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"What? What do you? Look, Jez, all right. The fact is she is a beautiful woman. That's just a fact. A blind man could see that. But, I mean, I'm not gonna do anything. I'm just like a kind of blind eunuch looking at a painting.",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, fair enough.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Mark,My carefully nurtured public image succeeds once again.,Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,Let's crack open the gin.,Flat
3,4,Mark,Mark,"Brilliant, total lack of self control. Drunk himself out of contention.",Flat
3,4,Big Suze,Mark,He was really guzzling wasn't he? Is he OK?,Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Big Suze,"Just very, very upset about Sarah. I think they really had a bond.",Mark's Room
3,4,Big Suze,Mark,Oh right.,Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Big Suze,"Suze, are you OK?",Mark's Room
3,4,Big Suze,Mark,"I don't know. It's just... I mean, my sister's just come off a moped in Zakynthos and she might have to have a pin her leg. And she flew budget so it'll be a nightmare coming through airport security. The only airline that really understands is BA.",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Big Suze,"Oh yeah, I know. They're great aren't they?",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Mark,"Here we go. My God, I'm gonna have to learn to ride a horse.",Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, this looks like a very sweet scene. What exactly is going on here?",Mark's Room
3,4,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Hi Jez, I was just telling Mark about Tor and her moped.",Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Big Suze,You realise what he's doing in here don't you?,Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,Jez...,Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Big Suze,He bloody loves you. It's pathetic.,Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,I bet you've got a hard on haven't you?,Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"What? No, of course I haven't. She was telling me about-",Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, stand up straight, take your trousers off.",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No, don't be ridiculous.",Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"If you're innocent you've got nothing to hide, have you. Come on, let's have a look!",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,No!,Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Let me feel it! It's hard, isn't it?",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,No and even if it was it wouldn't prove love. It's just a human body.,Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, it's a human body. Suddenly you're admitting to having a human body. You're no bloody eunuch that's for sure. I'm going to answer the door now Mark, but I'm coming back for you, and your cock.",Mark's Room
3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,"He was lying, he was lying all along the arsehole.",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Sarah,What?,Flat
3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,"Simon. I looked at his phone when he was in the loo. There were texts, today's, all hugs and bloody kisses.",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,She's back. This is a fucking nightmare.,Flat
3,4,Big Suze,Mark,"You don't, do you, have feelings for me Mark?",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Mark,"This is it, go for it. Tell her. Betray Sophie. Destroy Jeremy.",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Big Suze,"No. God no. As you know, I'm in love with Sophie.",Mark's Room
3,4,Big Suze,Mark,"Right, 'cause I thought-",Mark's Room
3,4,Mark,Big Suze,"Honestly Suze. I like you, sort of, but not even really that much. I mean, you're very, you know, horsey. You're the horsey type. Not that I've got a chip on my shoulder. But, you know, you're sort of a throwback. A kind of Marie Antoinette figure. Let them eat cake. Not that she ever said that, it's a mis-translation. But, you know, big stupid posh head, that's you.",Mark's Room
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,How am I gonna get out of this? She's like one of those horrible big turds that just won't flush.,Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Sarah,"If you want, I could call you a cab?",Flat
3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,"It's so good to be back where I'm safe. Look, we have got so much to talk about.",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Sarah,"Oh, right, yes. Of course.",Flat
3,4,Sarah,Jeremy,"I'm just gonna clean up, OK?",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh please Simon, take her back.",Flat
3,4,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Jez. Listen, I need a drink. Do you fancy a drink?",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Big Suze,"I can't really because- yes. Hold on, give me five.",Flat
3,4,Big Suze,Jeremy,Wicked. See you in the pub.,Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, happy now?",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Listen, I'm just going to the pub with Big Suze. Sarah's in the loo in a bit of a state, will you tell her I've finished with her?",Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No way, absolutely not. I'm not letting you leave. You've got to face up to your responsibilities!",Flat
3,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Just be nice about it though, because I really do love her. And tell her it's not her, it's me, and I've got commitment issues, yeah?",Flat
3,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you bloody-",Flat
3,4,Sarah,Mark,Mark what's- where's Jez?,Flat
3,4,Mark,Sarah,"Oh Sarah, I... Blimey. Look, the thing is... Look, it's really not my responsibility to tell you this. Jeremy's gone, all right? He's pissed off. He's left. And I'm not gonna do his dirty work.",Flat
3,4,Sarah,Mark,What dirty work?,Flat
3,4,Mark,Sarah,"Well he- the dickhead, he wanted me to dump you for him, if you can imagine that.",Flat
3,4,Sarah,Mark,He's dumping me?,Flat
3,4,Mark,Mark,I should just be honest. I owe her that at least. Just tell her he fucked her and now he's chucked her.,Flat
3,4,Mark,Sarah,"Look, it's not you it's him. He has commitment issues.",Flat
3,4,Sarah,Mark,You're loving this aren't you?,Flat
3,4,Mark,Sarah,I'm really not.,Flat
3,4,Sarah,Mark,"Yes you are. You never wanted me and Jez to be together. You're very, very controlling and I really think you need to talk about why that is.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Sarah,I really don't. And if you could stop the talking for just one minute then maybe Jeremy and Simon wouldn't keep on dumping you.,Flat
3,4,Sarah,Mark,"Oh, great. Brilliant. Thanks. Thank you very much Mark. See you later.",Flat
3,4,Mark,Mark,"Great. OK, so I've dumped my sister. That's great. That feels good. I'm intrigued to see what I'm gonna do next. Maybe I'll ring up Granddad and tell him I think he's a boring twat.",Flat
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Another hard day, eh, Jez? Watching kids' TV and eating kids' cereal?",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh all right. What should I be having? Gentleman's relish with olives? Anyway, Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes are just Frosties for wankers.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah well, Frosties are just Corn Flakes for people who can't face reality.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Anything from Soph?,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"She's been very very busy, far too busy for post. Don't think she'll actually be coming down over the weekend. She wants to it's just there's this thing.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,That sounds important.,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"What am I gonna do, Jez? Feels like she's slipping through my fingers.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Have you told her you love her?,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Are you kidding? That's like firing first in a duel. If you miss, you're fucked.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, no, mate, Saying I love you puts you in the driving seat. Sometimes I tell them I love them early on on a first date, just to get things off to a good start.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Doesn't that devalue it a bit?,Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,No. Maybe. A bit. Who cares? It works.,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Aren't you going to open your post?,Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"What? No, it's boring. ""You may have won this"", ""you may owe us that."" Who cares?",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, That one's On Her Majesty's Service, for God's sake.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, sure, it's On Her Majesty's Service, delivered by the Royal Mail. Probably an invitation to one of Princess Anne's shepherds pie and dogging parties. See? Now they want me to do jury service.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Jury service? You've been called up for jury service? I can't believe they'd choose you! Must be some kind of mistake.,Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Why shouldn't I do jury service?,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, because your... critical facult- I'm not being rude, but you'd be the first to admit that you're not a very logical thinker.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, I wouldn't.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"You still don't properly understand what happens in Ocean's Eleven, do you?",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,It's a complicated film.,Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,It really isn't.,Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Anyway, I'd probably find jury service pretty simple. Because whatever it is, I'll just let them off.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, Don't try and upset me.",Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's probably some young black kid whose been accused of stealing a bun, and I'm gonna set him free.",Kitchen
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Don't you think you should wait till you hear the details?,Kitchen
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,That's what they want you to do - hear the details and confuse you. I'm definitely gonna acquit.,Kitchen
3,5,Johnson,Mark,"So listen up guys. I'm looking to shake up the department, and I want you two to be my enforcers. Mm? My Cheech and Chong. My Skinner and Baddiel. You'll be the iron fists inside my velvet glove. The spiky balls on the end of my stick. Yeah?",JLB
3,5,Mark,Johnson,"Nice, yes.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Jeff,"Now remind me, which one of you two is balling Sophie right now?",JLB
3,5,Jeff,Johnson,"Ah, he is. Well, theoretically.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Mark,Patrick tells me she's not getting on all that well in Bristol.,JLB
3,5,Mark,Johnson,Really?,JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"If she gets fired and everything goes wrong, I'll be there to pick up the pieces.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Mark,"She's been slacking off. Coming in late. Apparently, she called Colin Cooper a dickhead.",JLB
3,5,Jeff,Johnson,"Well, he is a dickhead.",JLB
3,5,Johnson,Mark,"Yeah well the point is someone's gotta talk to her. Mark, maybe you could have a word? Get her to clean up her act? Unofficial verbal warning. Is that cool?",JLB
3,5,Mark,Johnson,"Oh, OK, sure.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Bollocks. Could be a difficult call. It might be good. Tell her I love her, then before it gets too soppy, hit her with the disciplinary matters.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez! So, first day in court, tell me everything.",Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, I've taken a solemn oath. I know that doesn't mean a lot to you but I take it quite seriously.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"I could get us a fried chicken bucket for dinner. And from a properly franchised outlet, not the one that gave you that fever.",Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's credit card fraud, and it's a woman. Six counts, four in the Nescliffe area, two in Cosford.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Credit card fraud?! Nescliffe?! A woman?! Oh, my God, this is incredible!",Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, sure, it sounds incredible for the first three hours. God, it's boring. ""Are you guilty?"", ""Blah, blah, blah."" I mean It's a joke, she's obviously guilty.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Why? Has she taken the stand? What's her alibi?,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She's the guilty type, she looks shifty.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Shifty?,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah you know the type. Dressed up all nice for court but wouldn't look out of place with a can of strong lager and an incredibly cheap fag in her mouth.,Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,I thought you were going to acquit.,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"She's white. Plus I was talking to another jury bloke and he thinks the same. I think we're all thinking the same basically you know, there's no smoke without fire.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,No smoke without fire?! Is that what a thousand years of the English judicial system comes down to? No smoke without fire?!,Supermarket
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, relax She's going down. And if she didn't do it, so what? She's the type, she'd probably just do something else.",Supermarket
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Ah, soup. Lovely hug in a mug. All I need now is a kiss in a tube. A wank in a packet. Better call Sophie. Or maybe, just before, play solitaire for three or four hours.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Shit, it's her!",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Hello, Sophie?",JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Hi, Mark! Listen, good news. I'm coming down tonight.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,Are you?,JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,Yeah! Can we hang out tonight? I miss you.,JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Of course, I- I miss you too. Although, tonight, you do know it's Thursday?",JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Oh yeah, I'll just pull a sickie in the morning.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, OK.",JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Johnson's right, she's dangerously out of control.",JLB
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"So, I'll come over to yours about seven-ish? Ooh this is going to be great!",JLB
3,5,Mark,Sophie,Brilliant. Bye.,JLB
3,5,Mark,Mark,Shit. Bottled it. Tell her tonight after chicken and wine and Sara Lee. Maybe I could get some chocolate-flavour condoms. I might be more relaxed if we both regarded my penis as a novelty item.,JLB
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh the jury is so boring. Why couldn't I get something interesting, like a cat-strangling, or a murder case that goes right to the heart of government? Oh, my God it's her. The defendant.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Do I know you? God, you're on the jury, aren't you?",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Yeah. Yeah, I am a bit. Sorry.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Wow, this is weird.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Yup! I probably shouldn't...,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Well I shouldn't, probably.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"To be honest, it's nice to get away from the jury. They're so boring. All they want to talk about is the case.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Yeah? What they saying about it then?,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,Shit.,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Oh, just uh... we all think you're innocent.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Really? That's wicked!,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,Just sugar the pill a bit.,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"I know I probably shouldn't do this but, what's your name?",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Jeremy.,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Pleased to meet you. I'm Carla. Tell you what though, I'll be glad when this is all over. Those wooden chairs are killing my back.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Oh God, tell me about it. That's why I sit in the corner, because you can sort of lean against the wall, and then if it gets a bit boring you can- you know, it's just better.",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"What about that judge, though, eh?",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,"Oh God, yeah. He's so judgmental. ""I rule this, I rule that"".",Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,"Eh that would be a good name for him. Judge Mental! Hey, I tell you what, I plead guilty to wanting a mochaccino!",Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Carla,Objection!,Coffee Shop
3,5,Carla,Jeremy,Overruled!,Coffee Shop
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,"This isn't wrong, just illegal. Like drink-driving.",Coffee Shop

3,5,Foreman,Jurors,So should we take a vote?' All those who think she's guilty raise a hand.,Juror's Room

3,5,Jeremy,Foreman,"Er, yeah, I just don't think she is that guilty. I mean I think there is a reasonable doubt.",Juror's Room
3,5,Jeremy,Jeremy,I'm in Twelve Angry Men. I'm the only one who's not angry. I'm horny. That's much nicer.,Juror's Room
3,5,Mark,Mark,"Oh what a night. We'll eat and laugh and I'll make out I think Colin Cooper's a dickhead too, when actually he's doing bloody good work with a difficult team and some very testing targets.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,Haha! Haha haha. Hurhurhurhur.,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,What's funny?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, nothing. Doesn't matter.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Is it something to do with the case?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Er, yeah, it is, kind of.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah. What's going on?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's really... honestly, it's nothing.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Did the uncle show up? They haven't found the missing security tapes from Ryman's?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, no, it's nothing like that. Anyway that doesn't matter any more because she's definitely innocent.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Is she? Why, what came out? What happened?",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"No, Nothing came out, it's just I got to know her a bit and it's obvious she wouldn't do something like that.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,You got to know her a bit?,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. We bumped into each other, we've been texting, we're going to go out for a drink.",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"For God's sake Jeremy, you're not supposed to speak to the defendant, it's against the law.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,The only seat in the cafe was next to her. What was I supposed to do? Blank her? That's against the law. The law of social niceness.,Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you've got to break this off. You've got to tell her to stop texting you and that you can't meet up for a drink.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, so suddenly I can't go out drinking with the defendant. Well why not?",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, I suppose people might think it would make you less impartial if you're trying to bone the woman you're meant to judging.",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh that is typical. ""Jeremy can't be trusted to judge the woman he's sleeping with but... but Tony Blair can."" Yeah?",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Jez. it's contempt of court.,Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"Look Mark, I'm a musician in case you'd forgotten. Yeah? I answer to a higher law, the law of, ""If it feels good, do it.""",Living Room
3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, that's a great law isn't it! What's that, Gaddafi's law?",Living Room
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"It's the musicians' law. Colonel Gaddafi could not lay down a bass hook, Mark. That should be clear even to you. God!",Living Room

3,5,Sophie,Mark,Isn't he fab?!,Flat
3,5,Mark,Mark,"He's gay! He's obviously gay. My God, I actually have gaydar. Is he going? I hope he's going. Shutting the door might be a bit aggressive if he's not.",Flat

3,5,Mark,Sophie,"Oh, good, thanks. You look great.",Living Room
3,5,Sophie,Mark,"Thanks! Do you like my hair? Shaylee did it, she works in the juice bar with Dom. And she does Indian head massage too. God, it's orgasmic!",Living Room

3,5,Mark,Jeremy,Because I don't want to wake up dribbling in a phone box with a trucker's penis in my ear!,Club

3,5,Mark,Jeremy,"But tonight, all that crap you talk when you're off your noggin, I never really listen. What do you prattle on about? And how should I say I'm feeling?",Club
3,5,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, look. Like, when you're coming up, it's kind of... Yeah? And then you're just- I mean, everything you do is just kind of... Yeah. And then when you're going down, you sort of just talk about how we're all the same but there are these systems that keep us apart and stuff.",Club

3,6,Mark,Mark,"Oh bollocks, I'm gonna end up proposing on the M4, possibly the M25, how romantic will that be? And it's all gonna be her fault. Why won't that stupid bitch let me propose to her?",Restaurant
3,6,Mark,Mark,"Argh that smarts! Horrible whisky. Still, midnight down the bar. Can't exactly have a chocolate milkshake, can I? Jesus, what am I going to do. I've got to ask her. Or, maybe just slope home, never mention it? Make Jeremy promise not to say jokes about it and- God I need someone to talk to, got to get my thoughts straight.

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"She went for a walk with these two idiots drinking sloe gin, now they've gone off and left her, she's scared and lost, I'm gonna go and find her. Argh, God, that's horrible. I could do with a hand.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"I don't wanna go but apparently you can't just do whatever you want because of ""civilisation"".",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, sure mate. Did she say where she was?",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,She thought she might be near a big rock.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh great, well that should be simple enough then.",Hotel

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Well I wanted to talk some stuff through with someone didn't I? You big dick.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"What stuff, you're not having gay feelings again, Mark?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, one time that happened. It's her.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Sophie,"Now Soph, I want you to remain calm but can you give me a description of the rock at all? Is it mossy for example- oh great. No no, that's fine. Sure, see you soon.",Quantocks

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Well we're going down so that must be right.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Except we went down and then up, so-",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Look we should just keep going we're bound to hit something soon. We should probably hurry 'cause Sophie said there might be a bit of a thunderstorm coming in.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh great, so we have no idea where we are and there might be a storm coming in and we haven't got any stuff and- brilliant, we're dead meat!",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"This isn't Matterhorn Jeremy, it's the Quantocks, nobody dies in the Quantocks. If we're very unlucky we might have wandered onto Exmoor but-",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Exmoor? The moors, the barren moors, the moors murderers? We could easily die on a moor. Give me your phone.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Why?,Quantocks

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,No.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,That's what they're there for!,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,We're not calling Mountain Rescue. We're not gonna be two of those idiots you hear about who go up mountains in flip flops and sombreros and have to get rescued.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"What, you'd be rather one of the idiots they find frozen to death being chewed by badgers, drinking their own piss?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"You can't call Mountain Rescue anyway, this isn't a mountain, it's a hill.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh right, they're gonna leave me to die because I haven't got a geography degree. You'd prefer that, wouldn't you? To die, rather than to ask for a simple piece of help? We are so going to die.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Will you please stop saying that. Ow, bollocks! Fuck!",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,What is it?,Quantocks

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Err, no.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,No?,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, mate, no, don't leave. 'Cause, and I'm not being rude, if you go you won't come back. You'll leave me here to die.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Ah, so, now you're admitting that one of us might die!",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Nobody is going to die- this is southern England, nobody dies in southern England Jeremy, that just doesn't happen, OK? Now, look, I haven't told you about this before but I actually have a bar of Dairy Milk with me. I think it's probably time we rationed it out.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Rationing? Can't we just have a bit? We've only been lost for twenty minutes and you want to start rationing, let's just eat it!",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well it's hardly worth starting the rationing once we've eaten it, is it?",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, you love rationing, don't you? You've been waiting for an opportunity to do rationing on me since the day we met and finally, finally, one's coming along and you love it, don't you?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,I just thought a block each every two hours and-,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Bollocks, give me my half now. You can ration yourself if you're so keen on it.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, if you insist. There's seven segments, so that's three each with one left over, which is mine seeing as it's... all mine.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"The spirit of the Blitz lives on, fucking hell. That is good, that is so good.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Just don't come to me asking for some more when you didn't have the foresight to-,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Can I have a bit more?,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,No.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh come on, just a bit. My half of the fourth chunk, come on.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, I explained to you all that.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh come on Mark, you knew what would happen as soon as you mentioned chocolate you knew I'd want to eat it. You know my nature. This isn't fair, you're using my nature against me.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, let's just concentrate on getting back to the hotel.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"All right, sure mate, sure. And thanks mate, for the chocolate.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Don't mention it.,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Mark,Always got the Twix. No need to mention the Twix.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh look a frisbee, somebody left a frisbee. We could use this to dig, or maybe catch something? A bird if you threw it really hard.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Uh-huh.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So listen mate, about this whole, um, you asking Sophie to get married.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah?,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"I mean, it's brilliant and everything, but, I was just wondering, have you considered, like, not doing it?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Not doing it? But that's what this whole weekend's been about. I saved for three months for the mega deal vouchers.,Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"No obviously and after all that... clipping, you're gonna want to have something to show for it. Like a wife. But, is it really a good idea?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I don't know, I kind of assumed it was because I spend all my time thinking about it, I'm obsessed with it.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Ah yeah. But you see, Super Hans is obsessed with crack and poppers and dusting his knob with speed but it doesn't make it right, does it? I mean, what is it about her that you actually love?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Are you kidding? Everything. Her, you know... I mean, she has changed a bit lately but we were... we had this connection.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Right.,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Which admittedly is kind of going, but... you know, she's funny. Although now I wonder whether she really was funny or whether she was just being normal but I liked her so much I thought she was funny.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh yeah, I know that one.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Plus, when I was at the height of Sophie madness it was when watching her across a hot photocopier... the little looks... the funny doodles.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Before you really had a relationship?,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly. It's almost like... the more we've got to know each other, the worse it's been. I mean we really have almost nothing in common.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Well maybe that's a sign?,Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh my God. I- I don't have to marry her. Jez, I'm not going to ask her to marry me. There might even be other women in the country who are willing to speak to me and now I can go out and find them. Or just give up on women and eat toasted sandwiches and watch TV.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh don't give up on women mate. I mean there's she-males, hookers, Thai brides, all God's rich tapestry.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Brilliant! Wow, I feel good. Hey, isn't this-? Jez, this is a footpath! A genuine, National Trust-maintained public right of way!",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Great, fantastic. Well let's go down shall we? We can snaffle the rest of the choco, go fifty-fifty.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez where you going, you great doofus? It's this way.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Err no, this way, down, yeah? Down the mountain, remember?",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, look, Jez we went down and then up, look I've just got this really, really strong feeling that I'm right and you should probably just give in because we both know that I'm a lot more stubborn than you, so just give in now.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, normally I give in but today I'm right and I don't want to go back up the mountain.",Quantocks
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Honestly Jez, well look if you really are going to go that way then take my fleece and my secret Twix because you are definitely going to be spending a long cold night on the moors.",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh great, the secret Twix. When were you going to tell me about this? Or were you going to wait until I was dead and then have it for dessert after you'd feasted on my carcass?",Quantocks
3,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Fucking hell, that took forever, finally back. He's always right. Why is he always right?",Hotel
3,6,Big Suze,Jeremy,"Jez, I'm so glad to see you. I was worried about you. Listen, do you want to cuddle up somewhere soft and warm and... you know?",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Big Suze,"Oh, I know, honey. Look, just give me five, yeah.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Wow, I'm just so tired and hungry and cold. She's gonna have a hell of a job coaxing a hard-on out of me, but I bet she'll manage.",Hotel

3,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Jez.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Hi Super Hans, how are you doing? I just wondered whether you still wanted some drugs?",Hotel
3,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"What? I'm over the hump, but yeah I'd love some drugs.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"And that's definitely your settled decision as a grown-up man, so, I've got nothing to feel guilty about if, say, I gave you some?",Hotel
3,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Not really.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,"OK. Well this is a big bag of drugs. And all I'm gonna do is just tape it on here like this. And then you know, have fun.",Hotel
3,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,Drugs. Drugs!,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Sophie,"Hey Soph, where's the Markster? practising his ""I told you so's""?",Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Jeremy,"He's not back Jeremy, he's still not back, I haven't slept a wink, do you think he's all right?",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Sophie,You're kidding?!,Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Jeremy,Is that Mark's fleece?,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Sophie,"I didn't kill him. I mean, I had the opportunity but no motive. I mean, don't worry Sophie, he'll be fine.",Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Jeremy,"Yeah, no I'm sure, it's just... I feel guilty, I was such an idiot and he just rushed out straight away to try and find me because he's so lovely like that. And I feel like I'm always the one, you know? He's such a good person, I'm always going on and on about the juice and the juice bar and smoothies. I mean, it's only fruit squashed up for God's sake!",Hotel

3,6,Mark,Jeremy,Hello. Hello Jez.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"And I was right, you were wrong. Look, you're wet through and really unhappy, all because you didn't listen to me.",Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,What happened?,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,"Well, I sort of slipped into a kind of mini ravine and there was... I angered a crow that was defending its young and then I eventually got a bit of, not exactly sleep, in a disused barn.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, I was right. Look at you, you're actually shivering. Brilliant.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Mark,"Urgh, can't believe I pissed on my legs to keep myself warm.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,Thanks Soph.,Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,"So listen I just wanted to say I'm so sorry for last night and being a big idiot and, you know, you and me, we've had lots of ups and downs and I guess the truth is, we just have lots of differences and we have a lot of different interests and stuff.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, yeah, I know Soph, so-",Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,"But at some point, you just have to say OK, I don't live in a fairy tale and we can have our own interests and our own gang of friends and I might do a bit more clubbing and you might do a bit more... history. But that doesn't mean we can't have a nice time and neither of us are getting any younger and I might want some little people around some time soon. So what I'm saying is, yes.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Sophie,What to?,Hotel
3,6,Sophie,Mark,"While you were out Mark, your alarm clock went off so I went into your bag to turn it off and I accidentally found something round and engagement-y!",Hotel

3,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,"Oh yeah, yep. I mean I'd probably be very angry at you if I wasn't so incredibly high.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So, Mark, congrats.",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Thank you, thanks.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"So, what the fuck? I mean, what happened? Did you change your mind?",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"No, no, not really, she found the ring.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Right?,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"She said yes, she accepted.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,But you hadn't asked.,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"There was a ring, that's an effective proposal.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,So you accepted the acceptance?,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Well I had to, it was checkmate, there was no way out.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Except for telling her how you felt.,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh right, yeah, sure like that was gonna happen. No I had to accept. It would have been too embarrassing not to accept to acceptance.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,"What, so you're going to get married to her out of embarrassment?",Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,There are worse reasons.,Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,I suppose you could always get divorced.,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh no, I'm not the divorcing type.",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,So you're gonna stay married to this woman for the rest of your life because of embarrassment?,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, probably and look, I'd be grateful if for the rest of my life you never mention it again, OK?",Hotel
3,6,Jeremy,Mark,Fair enough. To the happy couple!,Hotel
3,6,Others,Mark,The happy couple!,Hotel
3,6,Mark,Mark,"This is good. Not really loving her kind of puts me in a position of power. I win, sort of.",Hotel
