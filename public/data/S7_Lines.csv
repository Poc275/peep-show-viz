7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, suit yourself. Mmmmm, luxury milk.",Mark's Room
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,"Sweet. Just texted Ben. Said I had to go to a funeral. Plus, I've got the squits and you're locked in the bathroom having a breakdown. I threw a lot of shit at the wall, see what sticks.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Look at him, he's the worst kind of snake in the grass.",Jez's Car
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,What a shit.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"I mean, obviously I'd have betrayed him like that, but...",Jez's Car
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah but he didn't know that.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, exactly Jez, thank you. He, oh my God he's- that's my idea! He's using my idea!",Jez's Car
7,2,Jeremy,Mark,You taught him the palm? But I told you the palm!,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,He's juicing my balls! He's trying to screw her with my cock.,Jez's Car

7,2,Jeremy,Ben,...that's the whole story.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Jeremy,I'm going in. Tony B. Liar can disregard the U.N. but he can't disregard the Dobby Club.,Jez's Car
7,2,Jeremy,Ben,"Baby? Uh, yeah, that's just the baby, obviously, at the funeral with me. Don't worry little one, she's in Heaven. Your mummy's in Heaven now.",Jez's Car

7,2,Gerrard,Mark,Mark? What are you doing here?,Pub Garden
7,2,Mark,Gerrard,I could ask you the very same question. Judas.,Pub Garden

7,2,Gerrard,Mark,"Look, nothing's going on, all right? We're just having a drink.",Pub Garden
7,2,Mark,Gerrard,"I think you're doing a little more than that. No doubt once you've finished these, and she sufficiently high on E numbers, you'll try and supply her with another pork product whose name I don't think needs to be said out loud.",Pub Garden
7,2,Gerrard,Mark,"I'm sorry, Mark, OK? I saw a window of opportunity and I went for it. You would have done the same.",Pub Garden

7,2,Dobby,Mark,Mark? What the fuck?,Jez's Car

7,2,Mark,Dobby,Gerrard had to go. He was taken ill.,Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,"What, really? Is it serious?",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"A bit, but also you needn't give it a second thought. The squits.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,No further details required.,Jez's Car

7,2,Dobby,Mark,"So, you just happened to be in Epsom?",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Yeah but I was in the car, I'm on standby.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,Standby?,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"As Gerrard's replacement. It's cool, we look out for one another. Like me and Jez, he's right over there, so if, God forbid, something should happen, he'll be there to replace me.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,"I have to say, I'm mildly freaking my noggin right now.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Look, Dobby the truth is, me and Gerrard, we have a a sort of a club about you.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,A club?,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"It's not a real club, there's no clubhouse and there's only two of us. It's more of a shared passion, if you will. It's quite sophisticated. Like the Sunday Times wine club. But it's ironic too, so...",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,"Hmm, not nailing this.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,So Gerrard's not ill then.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"No more than usual, he agreed to step aside. Abort your date and let me have a pop.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,A pop?,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Not a pop, a go, a turn.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,Really not nailing this at all.,Jez's Car

7,2,Dobby,Mark,Mmmmm.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,"Nice. The ultimate aphrodisiac, my son's like a huge oyster.",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Look, the truth is, I came out here because I was insane with jealousy and if that's freaky than ill just go. But, the thing about driving for miles to spy on someone is that, if nothing else, it does sort of prove that you have quite strong feelings.",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,Yeah? Me and Kerry once hitched a Carlisle just because they had this wicked big Halfords.,Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Look, if there's nothing happening with you and Gerrard, does that actually mean that there's a... position vacant? As your boyfriend?",Jez's Car
7,2,Dobby,Mark,"What an incredibly off-putting way of putting it. If I say yes, will you stop saying things which are turning my stomach?",Jez's Car
7,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh my god, I've won. I'm resigning from the FDR/Cyberman conflict.",Jez's Car

7,2,Jeremy,Super Hans,"Yeah, look, I've been thinking with my thinking cap, and basically yeah, we're a great band and obviously I could sign us, of course I could. Um, I could sign us a thousand times over, but are we hungry enough? I mean sure, were hungry, but are we ravenous? Because-",Pub

7,2,Dobby,Mark,Oh just... I mean... I wonder how long the cider craze is gonna last.,Pub
7,2,Mark,Dobby,"Right. Yeah, me too.",Pub
7,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh, sure. Why is she a separate entity? There should be a viewing platform to see into her brain. If only I could get her brain in a jar, or hook her up to electrodes. I need thermal imaging of her brain cortex and a lab to analyse it afterwards. Then, I could finally relax.",Pub
7,2,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Right, suited and booted, yeah I'm just another band member running late because there was one last line of coke that needed snorting. Just uh, slide this up on here. Yeah, that right honey. One foot in the band. I'm re-joining you by the power of standing right by you.",Pub
7,2,Super Hans,Others,"Sorry about this everyone, um, just wanna clear something up. This is the band area, we are the band. This imaginary line at the edge of the stage is where the band ends. This man is not in the band, he is merely dressed like the band.",Pub

And now shitty Ben's decided he's coming because it's happening here and he's all jealous and suspicious. So what I thought was, even though I can't tell Ben to fuck off, I can defeat him mentally at the book group and impress Zahra by saying clever things. So I'm going to read all of this book from page one to... oh shit, three hundred and seventy-two?!",Hall

7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No, my battery, I've only got, like a milli-bit of power bar left. I suppose a phone of your own might be quite useful right now, yeah?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, it would, and I'm an idiot, and any attempt I make to escape the debt-driven rat race must be punished immediately, and in the most brutal fashion. OK, happy now?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I suppose we do need to get out of here quite soon, before the air supply runs out.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, in here, the air supply's gonna run out sooner or later. What? I'm not an idiot. Why does that make me an idiot?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"I need to make one call, just one call.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Just one, I'm not having you being profligate with my bar.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Others,"Hello, Directories? Yeah, Thornton Heath locksmiths, please.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,That's two!,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"They're putting me through, it counts as one.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Others,"Hello? It's just possible you could save my life. Yeah. I've got myself locked in my flat, if you can believe it. The address? Er, yep, the address. It's, erm, King's Road.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,King's Drive.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Others,King's Drive. And the number? The number.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"fifty-two, ooh, fifty-four. Er... fifty-",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Others,It's in the fifties.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Is it a forty? forty-something? It's a forty,... forty...",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Others,"Perhaps you could come to King's Drive and walk up and down, and I'll shout through the letter box?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Forty-two! Forty-two King's Drive!,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Others,"Forty-two, we're pretty sure we live at forty-two King's Drive.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, that's customer service. He called me a prong.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Prong? OK, Mark, give me the phone.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yeah, but there's the police or the fire brigade? If we tell one of them, they'll alert the others, 'cause they're all friends. I mean, not friends, but-",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, I know this phone. It's not one of these fakers that can run forever on one red millimetre. This phone doesn't fuck around.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"I never used to let my battery run down. I miss you, phone.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Ambulance?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Pizza.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,You can't waste the bar on pizza!,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Others,"Yes, I will hold.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Don't hold!,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I'm hungry, Mark! I didn't have any breakfast! Or would you have us both starve to death?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Others,"Yes, I'd like a large feast please...",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"Look at him, the greedy godfather gobbling pizza on his godson's time.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Are you posting yourself out piece by piece?,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"I'm trying to catch the light with my watch face, send out an SOS, Morse code. A passer-by might notice it.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Uh-huh. Maybe you'll attract a naval captain, who'll come and rescue us in his frigate. Ooh, I tell you what, though.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,What?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I really need a wee. Maybe, in a corner? Or we could make an area that became... disgusting?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"No, I'm not having it in here. If you need to wee, there's the letter box.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"What, you mean flop the hose out of the slot?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, needs must.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, right, and what if a passer-by decides to try and turn off the nozzle? Hmm? What if a squirrel wants a sausage? I'm not just sending my member out into the world solo to seek his fortune. I look after him and he looks after me. That's the contract. The letter box is not a glory hole for urine.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, I'm going to this christening. I'm gonna bloody well kick the door down.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Are you serious? You're going to kick the door, using one of your legs, with enough force it's going to be smashed open?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Yes.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark Corrigan is going to kick down a door? Oh, this is too good. Don't start yet. Just let me get settled. OK. And go, go, Gadget Leg! Mm, mm, good. Good first kick. Of course, you are going to have to smash it out of the frame, so only about another million more kicks like that and we'll be out.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Fuck you. I'm not wearing the right shoes.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, right, yeah, wrong shoes! Yeah, sure, bummer.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Arrrgh! I am so screwed! I'm so utterly, utterly screwed!",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, dude, Zahra's gonna call back. But, you know, until she does, we're in the Nether Zone, yeah? Time moves at a different speed in the Nether Zone. We need to relax.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"You can't relax! We've got to fight, worry, speculate, tut, pace, swear!",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Why?,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Because it's an emergency! And in an emergency, you watch breaking news, and count your tins of butter beans. You don't sit in the garden and put on Kiss FM.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Dude, we're here for the duration. Let's chill out.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,We have an obligation to be anxious. It's a mark of respect for the gravity of the situation.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Let's get to know each other.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, for God's sake!",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, um. Oh, oh! OK, if you had to, if you had to, would you have sex with me?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,It's a stupid question.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"If you had to. If the men came and they made us, with their guns.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, I don't know. I suppose, maybe I could do it, just so long as you didn't...",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,What?,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Enjoy it. I think maybe I could make it through, as long as I knew you weren't enjoying it.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Hang on. You're saying you could rape me, but you couldn't make love to me. That is so you, that is you all over.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,That is not me all over.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"OK, here's a history one. What would you have done in France in the war? Would you have joined the Resistance or not?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,I'm not getting into that.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Ah, but you want to, though, don't you? I've tickled your historical G-spot.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, you could at least try to take this seriously. You are the godfather. What do you think about this, Jeremy? Do you think this is too high?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Nah, that's fine, totally fine. Why don't you just jump out of the window?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,I think I could probably do it. I just need to lower myself the initial portion and then drop.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, we're not in Road Runner.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, I'm a father. I need to be at my son's christening. I'm not a park bench, White Lightning guy. Besides, after weeks of negotiation, I finally got Sophie to agree to James Ian rather than Ian James, after her dad.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Baby Ian.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Hmm.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Ian Chapman. You'd have a baby that sounded like a solicitor.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Exactly. So I need to make sure she doesn't swerve off-road at the last moment. Do you really think it's impossible?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Well, I mean, I could make it, but...",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,You think I couldn't do it but you could?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, if I needed to. I'd just jump over the trellis, bounce off the wall, hit the ground, parachute roll, basic moves.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, go on, then.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Nah.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Why not?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Not in the mood.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,Could I jump? Might make it easily. More likely splatter like a blood-filled pumpkin.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, that's better.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,You're actually doing it?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yes, I'm actually doing it.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"God, Jeremy! What if someone outside thinks it's some sort of comment? I hope there's no black or minority ethnic person walking past who thinks it's-",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Mark, it's a perfectly friendly piss. I'm not- Oh, shit! Withdraw all units. If it's the cops, don't open the door.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"I can't open the door, Jeremy. That's one of the key things about this whole situation.",Nether Zone
7,4,Delivery Driver,Jeremy,Pizza.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Delivery Driver,"Pizza! Nutritious, delicious pizza!",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,How's he supposed to deliver it through a locked door?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,I've thought about that.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Delivery Driver,"Just slide that baby through the letterbox, dude.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Of course, the letter box. Your new pleasure portal.",Nether Zone
7,4,Delivery Driver,Jeremy,"It won't fit, mate, it's a large one.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Defeated by your own greed. It's like a Grimms' fairy-tale.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Delivery Driver,"Piece by piece, dude. Piece by piece.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, you've got to be joking.",Nether Zone
7,4,Delivery Driver,Jeremy,"OK, money first.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Delivery Driver,Keep the change.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,This is so not how I imagined the day of my first-born son's christening.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Delivery Driver,"Oh, shit, no, the brush! Dude, dude, we're getting fucked with the brush!",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Do you want some?,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"A slice of bristly cheese-free pizza, lightly brushed in your piss? How can I refuse?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,What happens if you eat letter-box hair?,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Strangely, there's been very little research into that scenario.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Does post even need brushing? Who wants brushed post?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Delivery Driver,"Hang on, dude, I've got it. I've got a sheath. Use this as a protective covering.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"Look at him, the James Dyson of pissy pizza.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah. Hey, Mark, it's working. We've cracked it! We should sell these. Periodical pizza shields. We could take these to the Dragons!",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"We'll make our fortune. This is a situation millions of people find themselves in every day. There's no name for this situation, it's so unusual!",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Ben,"Hello? Oh, hi, Ben. Er... where am I? I'm at home right now. I mean I've got to go to this christening first, so I'll be on vibrate...",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"OK, he's lying. This is interesting. Fine, I'll get the pizza, shall I?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Ben,"OK, you're popping over to Zahra's? I mean, do you need to, dude?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"Great, I'm gonna miss the champagne and canapes because I'm working as Jeremy's mad pizza butler.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Ben,Great.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"Would actually quite like a slice. But if I ate one, I'd feel like he'd won.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Delivery Driver,Thanks!,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit! Ben's coming here! He's got a key, he's gonna pick up his laptop. Oh, fingerbobs!",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, that's great. We're saved, we're rescued! We might even make it to the christening in time. Everything's gonna be all right!",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"No, it's not. Everything's triple-fried fucked!",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Oh? Why?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Because I did sleep with Zahra last night, OK? If you really want to know.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Then why did you have such a go at me for being filthy-minded?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't know. I was just on a roll, enjoying being self-righteous. Besides, we very nearly didn't.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,I see.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"But then we totally did. I mean, if it makes you feel any better, the sex was terrible. We didn't connect. She's LEGO, I'm a Stickle Brick. Plus she's very orally focused, whereas I'm-",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,It's fine.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, shit. Oh, this is bad, this is really, really bad. I'm gonna lose the best job I've ever had. Oh, what am I gonna do?",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Why don't you try having sex with women who aren't already in relationships?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, that's nice. Kick the dirty dog while he's down. The dirty, filthy dog deserves another quick boot in his tender nuts.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"It is quite nice kicking him in his tender nuts, the filthy, filthy bastard.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,We've got to get out of here!,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Yes, that has been my view for some time, as it happens.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,Ooh.,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Oh. Is this the same window? 'Cause it looks much higher up.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"What, now you're actually considering it?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, I can't do it.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"Of course. He's a pathetic worm, just like me, good.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Ben's gonna be here any minute. I've got to hide.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Brilliant, hide. You could pretend to be a stuffed beast, or an extremely peculiarly shaped parcel.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey, Dr Sarcasmo, I've found something, look.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, congratulations, you've found an area.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,But we can utilize this area.,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Uh-huh?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"It could be great for sleeping, this could be where we sleep, or do our business.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"We are not shitting or sleeping in the area, Jeremy.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,I could hide in the area when Ben comes. Perfect!,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Hmm, didn't get four across, ""boat"", but they aced ""solipsism""? Who was this person?",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey, look, Mark.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Yeah?,Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"A thing, a bit. This is our ticket out of here. We can do anything with this!",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Your faith in the bit is touching, Jez.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"We could smash a window, or break a lock, or hit a man over the head with it. It's like ""Whose Line Is it Anyway?"" for criminals. We could sit on it for entertainment, or I could wedge it in.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Come on, bit, don't let me down now, bit.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Hold on, Jeremy. I think I might have found a simpler way of doing that, under the bucket.",Nether Zone
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Zahra's spare? Ahhh!,Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Mark,"Great, into the flat. Back to square one, whoo-hoo.",Nether Zone
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Right, phone.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Food, water! Hey, I wonder if she's the sort of dirty sausage that keep a little skin flick at the back here.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Jeremy, do you think we could take a brief time-out from the masturbatathon that is your life to go to my son's christening? Right, what's Sophie's mobile number? 07700, that's definitely how it starts.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"You can do it, Rain Man.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"07700, 9-0-0-5-6-3? I think that's right. It's ringing, it's ringing! Hello? It's not her, it was a man.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Try again. Try all the variations.,Zahra's Flat
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Try all the variations of the five or six numbers I'm not sure of?,Zahra's Flat
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Yeah, there can only be a few variations.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Of all the numbers?,Zahra's Flat
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,Yeah.,Zahra's Flat
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"You really are an imbecile, aren't you?",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,I'm only trying to help.,Zahra's Flat
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, you're not helping, you're-",Zahra's Flat

7,4,Jeremy,Mark,We've got to hide!,Zahra's Flat
7,4,Ben,Others,"I'm gonna grab my laptop, chow down on some brunchicus.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh no, Jez no, I don't want to hide.",Zahra's Flat
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,We should be safe in here.,Zahra's Bathroom

7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Sure, go on, then.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"I mean, not actually, but we should at least consider it.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Look, once he's had ""brunchicus"", he'll piss off and we can make a break for it.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,Well how long's that going to take?,Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I don't know! Look since we're stuck in here, you might as well answer my question about the French Resistance.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"I dunno, Jeremy. It would have been terribly difficult time, but I would probably have kept my head down.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,You're kidding! I totally would have joined up.,Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well that's very easy to say, Jeremy, but you would have risked death, not just for yourself, but for your family.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I'd probably have just got in a train to Berlin and taken Hitler down. Boof, the whole thing's over.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, I guess we'll never know for sure.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Oh, I know, I definitely know. No question about it.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Well, congratulations. You would have been a brave, brave man.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,I can't believe you wouldn't be in the Resistance with me. I'm really disappointed in you.,Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,I can only apologise.,Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Don't apologize to me, apologise to... Europe.",Zahra's Bathroom

7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"Oh, my, God.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Ben,Others,"Well, I don't know why they're called beanie hats. Maybe it's cos in the olden days people used to store beans in them? Who fucking cares? Yeah, all right, call me in a bit. Over, Gold Leader. Ohh!",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,So horrible.,Zahra's Bathroom

7,4,Mark,Jeremy,"OK, right, I've got to get out of here.",Zahra's Bathroom

7,4,Jeremy,Mark,"Bollocks. He's how old, one month? All he knows is that it's bath time in the biggest, weirdest bath in the world. All right, if you've got to go, can you at least do something like run out with the radio? Then he'll think you're a burglar.",Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Mark,Jeremy,The radio-loving burglar? What if he stabs me?,Zahra's Bathroom
7,4,Jeremy,Mark,He won't stab you. You're so overly dramatic.,Zahra's Bathroom

7,4,Zahra,Jeremy,My boyfriend's out there.,Zahra's Bathroom

7,4,Zahra,Jeremy,I can't handle this right now Jeremy. I think we should put the whole thing on ice.,Zahra's Bathroom

7,5,Jeremy,Mark,Nice to have your family here for Christmas.,Living Room

7,5,Dobby,Mark,"It's meant to be amazing, should we, do it this week?",Living Room
7,5,Mark,Dobby,"Uh, sure, it's just... we watched all the Losts and they were somewhat OK, and Heroes had some interesting themes, but also quite a lot of not-so-interesting themes, and Prison Break, by the end, I very much felt that I wanted to break out of the prison that Prison Break had become for us.

7,5,Pam,Dobby,Oh dear.,Living Room
7,5,Mark,Pam,"Look, I'm sure Dobby's boyfriend could have strolled into an Argos and got a bog standard bracelet from a spotty Saturday girl, but maybe he wanted to get something a little bit special, something with an inscription, perhaps, as it would make it extra special, but also would unexpectedly delay delivery. That's just one of a number of possibilities, right, so should we all just lay off him?",Living Room

7,6,Jeremy,Zahra,"Sure. I mean, Ben will definitely fire me, but I'll just get another job. I could easily start my own music merchandise website. I mean, I'm gonna get a laptop, so, er, yeah, sorted.",Hall

7,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Who's the chick?,Super Hans' Party

7,6,Jeremy,Super Hans,Wow. And what does she...?,Super Hans' Party
7,6,Super Hans,Jeremy,I don't know much about her. She don't speak English. We speak the language of love. And a tiny little bit of German.,Super Hans' Party

7,6,Mark,Super Hans,"Hans, we get the message. There's probably no need to list all the things you'd put up bottom for your girlfriend.",Super Hans' Party
7,6,Mark,Mark,"Can't believe he's actually moving out. I'm going to be an unemployed single mother stuck in the flat, eating Frosties from a salad bowl, until I die from loneliness. And two weeks later they break down the door to find Ian sucking on my cold, dead teats.",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Hey, Mark. I think Super Hans' girlfriend fancies me.",Off-Licence

7,6,Jeremy,Mark,The symbolism? The drummer's my dick.,Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Look, just because, for some reason, you associate a chicken drumstick with your penis, doesn't mean that anyone was flirting with you.",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,She definitely was.,Off-Licence

7,6,Jeremy,Mark,I'm sorry?,Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"I've been thinking and I need to make the gesture. And you know, maybe this is the kick up the arse we both need. I could turn your room into an office. Finally nail ""Business Secrets Of The Pharaohs"".",Off-Licence
7,6,Jeremy,Mark,"Right. OK, man. Yeah. Good on you. Because, um, yeah I mean obviously, we've always been amazing mates, but, also a bit like lead weights dragging each other down?",Off-Licence
7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"Exactly. Living together, it's been like eating a vast portion of chips. Very comforting, but also there's this lurking sense you're killing yourself. Right?",Off-Licence

7,6,Mark,Super Hans,Right? I'm not sure I-,Taxi
7,6,Super Hans,Mark,"Yeah, I just love smack. Probably not the right man to ask. Anyway, I'm out the game now. When I first set eyes on this one, it was like my first joint, like my first Bowie track, like my first Ruth Rendell. I just knew. We both did, didn't we, sweetheart? Yeah.",Taxi
7,6,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Yep, she fancies me. I knew it.",Taxi

7,6,Mark,Mark,"If we're going to name his cock after a Clint Eastwood film, it's ""The Unforgiven"".",Big Suze's Place

7,6,Mark,Jeremy,"It's fine, Jeremy. Everyone sends an ex the odd... object. It's a natural part of breaking up.",Big Suze's Place

7,6,Big Suze,Mark,"Hmm, not sure. There are an awful lot of, what I'm sure you won't mind me calling, ""your types"" here! So... But listen, since you've both been so wonderfully clever and made it here without an invitation card or anything, would you mind being total stars and helping out? Is that all right?
