2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Jeremy, what are you doing?",Flat

2,1,Mark,Jeremy, You love her? What do you love about her?,Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Mmm, everything. Her vibe. Oh, God, why does the world have to be so wrong?",Flat
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Come on, Jez! You don't love her. You're just jealous 'cause her husband's back.",Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," There's only so much happiness in the world, Mark, and they're hoarding it all.",Flat
2,1,Mark,Jeremy, That's not how happiness works.,Flat
2,1,Mark,Mark,It completely is,Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Yeah, what would you know about love or happiness?",Flat
2,1,Mark,Mark,"What do I know about love and happiness? I know you have to play dirty, my friend. Just can't seem to crack it. Got to go! Can't believe Personnel issued happy hats. Johnson's our new boss. Course we're going to be happy.",JLB
2,1,Johnson,Others, I'd like to thank everyone for such a warm welcome to JLB...,JLB
2,1,Mark,Mark,Maybe I should stop trying to break into her e-mail. Just have a nice big talk to Sophie. A proper chat. Really get down to it.,JLB
2,1,Johnson,Others, ...what this department needs a kick up the arse so hard my foot'll go right up your digestive tract and wiggle out your mouth like a little leather tongue.,JLB
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, fuck carrot and stick, he's making the stick out of carrot. Jesus, he's good. Careful, there's man love and there's business love and never the twain shall meet. OK, Sophie, here goes. No running away, just stay here and let it all flood out.",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark," Hey, Mark! How's it hanging?",JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," OK, thanks. Sophie, I was wondering- I was hoping that we could have a chat. A proper chat.",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark, Oh. Yeah?,JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Yeah. So... tell me, what was the name of your first childhood pet?",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark," Gerbil, the gerbil.",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark, I love this song! Why?,JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Oh, Jeremy and I were having a bet. Only wine gums, but it makes the evenings go a bit quicker.",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark," Uh huh. So, do you want to dance?",JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," I can't, really, it's not…",JLB
2,1,Jeff,Sophie," Hi, Soph. You dancing?",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Jeff," Oh, you betcha!",JLB
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, you won't be so cocky, Jeff, when I come into the office with a Kalashnikov and two hundred rounds of ammunition. I'm probably exactly the sort of person who could end up doing something like that.",JLB
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Come on, gerbil! Ah, cock-knobs! All right, what's her favourite TV show? Sex and the City. S-A-T-C. Bollocks. Maybe she thinks it's Sex In the City. Yes! I'm in! Bollocks to emoting, I've got my hands on her innards! Hello... ""Mark vs Jeff"", this I have to see. Blah, blah, ""Jeff's a laugh, but he can be a bit of an arsehole, but I do fancy him. Mark's clever and funny, but he's so serious. I wish we could just be mates for a while but he's so uptight."" OK.",JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Hey, Soph!",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark," Hey, Mark! So, you wanted to have a big chat and everything?",JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Yeah, we could do, but then why be so serious and uptight all the time? We're mates, we should relax, do matey things, yeah?",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark, Absolutely!,JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Like a movie. A movie on a wet Saturday. That's what mates do, right?",JLB
2,1,Sophie,Mark, Sure. Or what about a dance class? If you think you can face it you can come to my dance class!,JLB
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Dancing? Yes, dancing, I love dancing.",JLB
2,1,Mark,Mark,Because it makes me look like a coma victim being stood up and zapped with a cattle prod.,JLB
2,1,Toni,Jeremy," How about biscotti? Jeremy, would you like some biscotti?",Toni's Flat

2,1,Toni,Tony, I was just telling Jeremy about the Brand New Heavies new album.,Toni's Flat
2,1,Tony,Toni," Yeah. That's something to look forward to, isn't it?",Toni's Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Tony," I'd like a ginger nut, if there are any.",Toni's Flat
2,1,Tony,Jeremy," Yeah, I think there are some.",Toni's Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Toni," I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.",Toni's Flat
2,1,Toni,Jeremy, Jeremy...,Toni's Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Toni," God, you're so... I mean…",Toni's Flat
2,1,Tony,Jeremy, What's going on?,Toni's Flat
2,1,Toni,Tony," Tony, Jeremy loves me.",Toni's Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Tony," Um, no, I didn't actually…",Toni's Flat
2,1,Tony,Jeremy," Of course you do. You're a moth, sucked in by the light. I've been banging my head for fifteen years against that beautiful light bulb, and I wouldn't change a day.",Toni's Flat
2,1,Tony,Jeremy," She's the beautiful poison, my friend.",Toni's Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, this is such a mess. It's fantastic.",Toni's Flat
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," This is the best thing for you, mate. Take your mind off it.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Mark, Maybe I should send her a bit of ear. Or a finger. Just to show I'm really serious.,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Sophie,Mark,"Hi, guys! There's a changing room round there if you want to…",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Um, I thought these would be... this is salsa, isn't it?",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Sophie,Mark," No. Oh, no, salsa's on Tuesdays. No this is Rainbow Rhythms, it's quite full-on. Mark, are you all right with that?",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Sophie, Me? Totally. This looks...cool.,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Mark,I've walked into my own personal nightmare. Must remain non-uptight for Sophie. Even if they make me play trust exercises with their genitals.,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Dance Teacher,Others," OK, so now we move into red, the colour of primal urges.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Jesus. Mark's such a honky. I'm definitely the alpha-est male here. He's probably here for community service. He looks like he's actually getting a bonk on. I'm definitely king of the hippie jungle.,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Dance Teacher,Others," Now, take a partner. And with that partner, let the music take you into your primal self.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,Jesus Christ! She must be a tranny. She's no tranny!,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Mark,"I'm not really here, it's research. I'm Louis Theroux. I'm Louis Theroux. Hey! No fair, that's my fun! Got to get in there.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Others,"Look, can you please just get out of my way? Thank you.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Sophie,"Hey, Soph! I came with her. It's really hot! Do you fancy ducking out for a while?",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Sophie,Mark, We're right in the middle!,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Mark,Is this it? Is this what my granddad died for? The freedom to do this? Jesus!,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Dance Teacher,Others," So, how did we all experience the class?",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Others,Dance Teacher," Well, um I felt a lot of stuff to do with rejection coming up for me tonight. Um, I was dancing with someone and they made it very clear that they didn't want to be with me. Uh and it just brought up a lot of feelings. That's all. Thanks.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Others,Dance Teacher," Yeah, there was a lot of new energy in the room tonight, and some of it was just so Rainbow Rhythms, and some of it was just so not Rainbow Rhythms. Thanks.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Others," Why don't you just say who you're talking about? You're talking about me, aren't you?",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Others,Mark," Well, yes, all right, I am.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Others," Well, listen. I'm sorry if I didn't do it right, and I'm sorry if you assume that I eat red meat and don't necessarily think money or Tony Blair are a bad thing, but if there isn't room here for people who stand against everything you believe in, then what sort of a hippie free-for-all is this?",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,I can't believe yesterday morning I was trying to jerk off to Toni's answerphone message and this morning…,Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," Oh, Jesus!",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus!",Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," Oh, Jesus, thank you for this experience!",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," Yeah, thanks, Jesus.",Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," OK, now stop.",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, What?,Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy, Don't move a muscle. Now we hold this moment for as long as we can in total silence.,Jez's Room
2,1,Mark,Jeremy, Jeremy!,Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Mark,Go... away!,Jez's Room
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," No, Jez. Look, we've discussed this. Early in the morning counts as late at night and we agreed no reggae music late at night, so…",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Mark, What?!,Jez's Room
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Oh, for God's sake, Jeremy. I can't talk to you with that.",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," What? Oh for God's sake, Mark, we've both got one, haven't we?",Jez's Room
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Look, Jez, can you please just keep it quiet? Because some of us have jobs to go to.",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Mark, your job is going to the office. My job is having sex. Yeah? That's what I do now. That's what I am. I'm a sexer. OK?",Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Mark," Sorry, Mark, did we wake you? We were both coming so hard we didn't notice the volume.",Jez's Room
2,1,Mark,Nancy," An explanation. Finally. Thank you, Nancy. Thanks for the explanation.",Jez's Room
2,1,Mark,Mark,"OK, so, dance class. Ali-kazoo, ali-kazam, let's find out just how fucked I am. OK, here we go. 'And last night Mark was a bit weird.' Fair comment. 'He didn't really get it.' What's to get? 'But, shit! He came, so that was pretty amazing.' OK! 'Had dinner with Jeff later.' Ooh, naughty. 'Gave him a kiss, but not sure. He can be so pushy.' He kissed her?! I've got to make a move! Maybe I should try tapping her phone.",JLB
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Hope they're not doing it in the hall. There's nothing erotic about a hall, is there?",Flat
2,1,Mark,Jeremy,Hello?! I'm coming in now! This is me coming into my house!,Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Mark, Hey Mark.,Flat
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," All right, Jez. Is Nancy around?",Flat
2,1,Jeremy,Mark, Just gone. I'm seeing her down the Rhythms.,Flat
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Right, OK. Jez, why's the chair- and what's all this strawberry? And my yoghurt? Jez, what's happened to my Muller? Oh, no, you haven't, have you? You haven't been sexing it up in here with my yoghurt?",Kitchen
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Relax, Mark, it's all right. We were just feeling very horny.",Kitchen
2,1,Mark,Jeremy, I don't want to know! OK? I don't want to hear about it! And I don't want it using up all my yogurt and bloody shower gel?!,Kitchen
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Mark, I'm just in a very erotic relationship right now. I mean, we're systematically breaking down all the taboos that society has.",Kitchen
2,1,Mark,Jeremy,"Right. And love? Romance? I mean, is there any romance in any of this at all?",Bathroom
2,1,Jeremy,Mark, Who needs romance when you're doing it up the bum?,Bathroom
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Exactly. Exactly my point. I mean, if you've actually done that, which, by the way, I can see no point whatsoever in myself…",Bathroom
2,1,Jeremy,Mark,You'd love to try it.,Bathroom
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," I honestly would not! What is this modern obsession with... that? Look, Jez, what I'm trying to say is, so, for better, for worse, the '60s happened, and now sex is, fine. But can't we take the best of that, the nice music, the colours, the ""I have dream"", et cetera, but not have to face the... squalor?",Bathroom
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Uh, you might want to give that a bit of a rinse, actually, mate.",Bathroom
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, Do I really have to do this?,Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," What are you afraid of, Jeremy? All done.",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," I dunno, it just feels almost... wrong.",Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," We're breaking a taboo, of course it feels wrong. We've got boundaries to smash, Jeremy. It's our duty to God, Shiva, NASDAQ, whatever you want to call him.",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, But are you sure this isn't ...racist?,Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," Jeremy, I come from America. I've seen the problems race brings up. Now fuck me and pretend I'm your mom!",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, What?! Why?!,Jez's Room
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," You can't imagine your mom having sex with a black man? That's pretty racist, Jeremy.",Jez's Room
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," It's not that, it's just Mum? Really? Mummy? I-I'm sorry, Nancy, I can't do it. I'm not getting anything. I'm sorry. I just can't.",Jez's Room
2,1,Mark,Mark,I wonder which of my treasured possessions they'll be putting in each other's anuses tonight.,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, she's amazing. Got to keep her interested. Prove I can keep breaking taboos. But what? Take a crap on the floor? No.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Toni,Jeremy," Hi, honey, I managed to make it!",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Toni, Oh. Brilliant.,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Toni,Jeremy," Tony and I have talked it all through, the whole horrible situation.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Toni, What situation?,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Toni,Jeremy, You being in love with me!,Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Toni," Oh, right. Yeah.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Dance Teacher,Others," Now, as we flow into yellow, remember, stop thinking. Let your body dance you.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Next she'll be telling us to use the Force. If you ask me, Skywalker was bloody lucky to get away with turning off his guidance system. No, if I want to act relaxed, it's gonna take all my cunning, skill and concentration.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit! Who's Mr. New Pants? Fuck, he's crossing a boundary. Bollocks, why did we come somewhere with no boundaries? This would never happen at the pub.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Dance Teacher,Others,"Now, as we move into red, let it all go my super-luminaries. Open the box.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, sure, honey. Appear to be opening the box while in fact, the lid stays very firmly on. She's buying it! God, it's so easy being a freak, no wonder they're ten a penny. I should get extra marks for not feeling a fucking thing.",Rainbow Rhythms
2,1,Sophie,Mark," Mark, how are you feeling? You looked like you were really getting in touch with something in there.",Pub
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, for God's sake!",Pub
2,1,Mark,Sophie,"Yeah, well, it wasn't really me as such, it was almost as if something was flowing out of me.",Pub
2,1,Nancy,Mark," Mmm, that literally happened to me the first time I went. I opened up so much I puked!",Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, Oh blimey.,Pub
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy, I think that's fantastic.,Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," No, brilliant. I mean, that's brilliant, honey. You're such a bloody trooper.",Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy, Well that's when I decided to live in the open 24/7. No more crap,Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," Absolutely, sweetheart.",Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," I mean, we have a great time together and obviously we both know it's an open relationship.",Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, Exactly. We're open in our relationship.,Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy, And we're open with other people.,Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, We... are?,Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," That's what we're all about, right, Jez? Freedom?",Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," Sure, Nance, sure, yeah. Freedom, loyalty, commitment, monogamy. In a sense, that's the final taboo, isn't it?",Pub
2,1,Toni,Jeremy," That's funny, you weren't worried about monogamy the other day when you came round and told me you were in love with me.",Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Toni," Right, yeah. I mean, that was a bit of a- not mistake, or joke, but just... wrong. I mean, you can't love two people at once.",Pub
2,1,Toni,Jeremy," Yes, you can.",Pub
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy, Of course you can.,Pub
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," No, sure, obviously you can, but you don't. You work out who you like best and then you pretend not to like anyone else.",Pub
2,1,Mark,Sophie," What do you think, Soph? Can you love more than one person at a time?",Pub
2,1,Sophie,Mark," Well, um, I mean, it depends what type of love you're talking about...",Pub
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Yeah, but what does she really think? Probably shouldn't look again today. More than once every four hours would be obsessive.",Pub
2,1,Sophie,Sophie, ...very confusing.,Pub
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Tell you what, I'm going off to the bog. For a wee!",Pub
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Conversation is rubbish. You could literally waste years talking to someone and never get the bottom line. OK, still nothing interesting in the outbox. She needs to express her feelings more. Ha! Just, check the inbox. A-ha! Jeff. Just arrived. What's your game? ""Soph, just a thought, do you fancy going punting on Saturday? Thought it might be a laugh. Bell me. Love Jeffy."" Jeffy, ugh. Punting? Punting equals shunting. Got to get in first, ask her out on a day trip. What's a banker?",Pub
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," And we'd be exploring the miracles of flight and human endeavour. It's a spiritual thing, really.",Nancy's VW
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Mark, we are not going to RAF Duxford.",Nancy's VW
2,1,Sophie,Mark," And I'm sorry, but we did vote, so the Todsford stone circle it is.",Nancy's VW
2,1,Mark,Sophie," Yes. Yes, I know. Well, it'll be good to go to a field and look at some stones.",Nancy's VW
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, Ah shit. We've gone into the crease. I can't make out anything in the crease.,Nancy's VW
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy," Jez, we've been lost for four hours now. Fuck it, I'm going to Tolsbury.",Nancy's VW
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy, Tolsbury?,Nancy's VW
2,1,Nancy,Jeremy,Yeah. We can surprise Gwyn from dance class! He's got a boathouse there.,Nancy's VW
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy," Oh right, Gwyn. Brilliant.",Nancy's VW
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Shit. Got to stop this. Grab the wheel, cause an accident. There's definitely a taboo against that. Plus, if she got disfigured, she'd be more likely to stick with me. But what if I came off worse, lost a limb? I'm punching above my weight as it is.",Nancy's VW
2,1,Jeremy,Nancy,"Or, listen, if we take a right up ahead, we could make it to this really wicked-looking public weighbridge!",Nancy's VW
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy," This is great, so great to see you guys down here.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Nancy,Gwyn," This place is just fantastic, Gwyn. Isn't it fantastic?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Gwyn, Amazing.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Gwyn, Brilliant.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn, Yeah. We should probably think about heading off.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," Nonsense. You're here, enjoy. Hey, I tell you what. Let's all take a swim.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn," Yeah, nice idea but no stuff, so we'd better be off.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," On a day like this, what stuff do you need? ""Sorry, I can't possibly enjoy the fresh water against my skin, I haven't got my stuff.""",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn," All right, I don't need stuff, either. Yeah forget stuff, let's have it.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Gwyn, Is there no stuff I can borrow? I really do feel much more comfortable with stuff.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Jeremy," Oh, this is amazing! I love this!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Come on, Mark!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Mark, Get the pants off dude and come on in!,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Gwyn," Heh heh, I might keep them on, actually.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Oh come on Mark, don't be a party pooper, get 'em off!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Nancy,Mark," Yeah! Yay, come on!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,No way. No fucking way.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Nancy,"I'm not sure I want to swim, actually. I might just watch.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Mark, Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark, Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Come on, we've all got 'em off, get 'em off! We're having fun!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Jez Jez, seriously, don't!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," I'm pulling your pants down, Mark!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Fuck off! Fuck off! Fuck off me! I'll do it. All right? I'll do it. In my own time, I'll do it.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark, Yay!,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,"OK, done the hard part. They've seen and rated my penis, now it's time to take advantage of the '60s vibe to get it on with Sophie.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Nancy,Gwyn," This place is amazing, Gwyn. How can you afford it all?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy, I guess I've just been very lucky. Money's an energy and lots of it has always flowed towards me. Particularly after my parents died.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn, Cosmic.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," Yeah well, that might sound funny to you, but it was actually quite a painful time.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn, No I just meant…,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"You're not gonna out-hippie me, you fucking hippie.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn,This place has great energy.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," Yeah. I remember when I first spent time down here. I was 14 years old, and I came down here all alone, just with a candle and an old, old copy of Henry Miller. And I just had the most amazing wank. I mean it really just bust me open. I couldn't believe that I had this instrument right there. Isn't it amazing, that first big wank?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Nancy,Gwyn," Oh, yeah.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn," Oh, yeah.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Gwyn, Yeah.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy," I tell you what we used to do down here when we were kids. Spin the bottle, that whole thing. Hey. Why not? Why don't we just fucking go for it?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Nancy,Gwyn, Yeah!,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy," OK, so, whoever's on kisses whoever the bottle stops at. Cool?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark, Yeah. Mark?,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Say no, ask her to go for a walk.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie,"Sure, yeah.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," OK, so, Jez, you're on, and it's…",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Nancy, Nancy, Nancy",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Mark, Mark.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn," OK, so, what happens? Spin again?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Jeremy," Sure. If you can't handle it, spin again.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Gwyn," Oh, I can handle it. I just wasn't sure about, Mark, where you stand on... taboos.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,I'm not uptight. I'm not uptight.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Jeremy,I hate taboos.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Mark," Well, me too. I break them.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Jeremy," Me too, I love breaking them.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,"Oh, no! No! No! I can't believe this is happening. He doesn't even floss. I tell him, but he won't. Jesus, when can we stop?",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Don't stop first. If I don't mind looking gay, I'll seem the most hetero. At least it's Mark. Oh, Jesus, it's Mark!",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Sophie,Mark," Wow, Mark! Well done.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Sophie, Thank you.,Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Gwyn,Nancy," OK, so, Nancy's on.",Gwyn's Cabin
2,1,Mark,Mark,This is probably how the Manson family started.,Gwyn's Cabin

2,2,Daryl,Mark," What, stop being mates?",Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Yeah, you know, you say potato, I say tomato - let's call the whole thing off.",Restaurant
2,2,Daryl,Mark," But, but why?",Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Well, it's the twenty-first century, no one actually likes each other any more, so let's just leave it at that shall we?",Restaurant
2,2,Daryl,Mark, No but I do like you! I think you're fucking great!,Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I don't have time. OK? There's no time. So let's just forget anything ever happened, OK?",Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Mark,"It's OK, he doesn't have any feelings. Racists don't have feelings, they're subhuman.",Restaurant
2,2,Mark,Mark,"Yes, little Tetraminos, you fit neatly together and dissolve because everything is simple in Tetris world.",Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Jeremy," Uh, Mark? I've got a massive, massive favour to ask you.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, Uh-huh?,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Yeah. It's, um... the thing is, Gog, he's got some reservations about the track and he's holding out on the four grand till we get it right.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, Uh-huh.,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," But the thing is, I've basically been very, very foolish, and I've spent all of our advance on drugs and shoes, and I really need to borrow quite a lot of money to go back into the studio and I was thinking I mean, you are the manager.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," OK, how much?",Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Brilliant! Now, the favour…",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, That's not the favour?!,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," Uh no. You see, the thing is, Gog he's really not very keen at all on any of the track except, as it turns out, for the cor anglais. He wants much, much more cor anglais.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," No, Jeremy. You know what Daryl's like.",Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," No, sure. Yeah. Absolutely. Of course. But look at it another way, we've all got our foibles. I mean, I, for example, hate mozzarella.",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, It's not the same.,Mark's Room
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," It is kind of the same. I mean, aren't we supposed to be living in a multicultural democracy? And isn't that the point? You know, the Jews and the Muslims and the racists all living happily together, side by side, doing and saying whatever the hell they like?",Mark's Room
2,2,Mark,Mark,"Cor anglais, of course. Probably plays it in the BNP jazz combo.",Recording Studio
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans," Brilliant, fantastic. What did you think, Hans?",Recording Studio
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy, Crack. Just gimme crack.,Recording Studio
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans," Well, I loved it. If you want to print one of those out, or whatever.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Jeremy, don't just go!",Recording Studio
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy, I'll suck for crack!,Recording Studio
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans," Yeah come on Super Hans, let's get you some crack! Tell Daryl we're very grateful.",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark, Great to hear from ya! You got over whatever brain attack you had in Frankie and Benny's then?,Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Mark,"I'm safe. In my cubicle, I'm safe.",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," So are we off for a pint, or what?",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Uh, Daryl, listen, the truth is I can't be associated with you any more, because you're a racist.",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," What? Yeah, but I thought we were on the same wavelength! You know, the sausage, the Euro, Clarkson.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl," There's a difference. Daryl, you can't hate people because of their ethnic background!",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Oh, right. Political correctness gone mad.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl," No! I hate political correctness gone mad more than anyone! I don't want to teach the world to sing, that would be horrible, but slavery? The Holocaust? That's just not on! Whereas, ""I Have A Dream"", South Africa, Benetton, it's- you've got to say, fair enough. Yeah?",Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Yeah. OK, no. Fair enough. You've talked me round.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Daryl, I have?,Recording Studio
2,2,Daryl,Mark, Fuck off! Thought police!,Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Mark,"Well, there he goes. The first friend I've made since Nick Bickford in '96. And I'm pretty sure Nick didn't really like me.",Recording Studio
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Do we have to do this? We're not going to hurt him, are we?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Mark," You want your money back, don't you? He's refusing to pay up, Mark. He's refusing to like the track.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy, I told you you should've had a proper contract!,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans," How are you feeling, Super Hans?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy," Fine, totally fine.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Super Hans, You've kicked the crack?,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Mark," No, except now I bang a load of Valium up me arsehole for the comedown.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Super Hans, What's this?,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Mark, Cover. In case the cops turn up. Just a bunch of mates playing a lovely game of baseball.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy," Oh! Jeremy. Right, so, what, you've had more thoughts about the track?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," Yeah, yeah we have, actually.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy," OK, great.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog, Yeah. We thought we might smash your brains in with a baseball bat.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Gog, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," See, we want our money, and we're feeling a little bit clumsy. Whoops.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy,"Look, Jeremy, I've told you, it's out of my hands now. The Honda people are very hard to please.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," Oh, Honda, Honda, Honda. Fuck Honda.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Gog," Nice packet of Crunchy Nut you've got here. Pretty expensive, as I recall.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," Not so rich and successful now with a piece of wood in your face, mmm?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy," Oi, Jez!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," Look, Jeremy, we can come back again, he's got the message.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Gog,"You're gonna pay, aren't you?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Mark, No.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," All right then, we've got our answer. Let's go!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy," We've got to hurt him on principle. Hit him with the fucking bat, Jez.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Super Hans, Why do I have to... why don't you do it? Punch him with the glove.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy, Punch him? I can't even make a fist!,Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Jeremy," This is the whole point about contract law, the whole point of a contract is to make sure this kind of thing never happens!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog, Don't answer it.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Jeremy, What if it's Honda?,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog, It's not going to be Honda.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Super Hans,Jeremy, Could be Honda.,Gog's Flat
2,2,Jeremy,Gog," All right, but a word out of place and you're getting the bat.",Gog's Flat
2,2,Gog,Others," Hello? Honda! Oh, really? Oh well, that's great news. I'm so pleased. Dave, call the police! There's people here, they're trying to kill me, they're trying to kill me!",Gog's Flat
2,2,Mark,Others," Hello uh, Dave, it's Mark here. I'm an old friend of Gog's. Don't worry, we're not trying to kill him, it's just he's never had sushi before, he thought we were trying to poison him! It's all right, Gog, you're not meant to cook it, it's supposed to be raw! Can he... can he call you back?",Gog's Flat
2,2,Sophie,Mark," Hey, Mark. What's the big stink?",JLB
2,2,Mark,Sophie, Daryl's getting the sack. Apparently he was a massive racist and not even his best friends knew. Someone reported him.,JLB
2,2,Sophie,Mark, Right!,JLB
2,2,Mark,Mark,"Oh, shit! He knows, he knows it was me. He's got a pipe bomb in his trousers. Don't bomb me, you wouldn't bomb a whitey!",JLB
2,2,Daryl,Mark," Listen don't worry, I'm not going to embarrass you, all right? I'm going now. I just wanted to say I don't care what happened, I still think you're a bloody good guy. Oh, and I took the rap for the sausage as well, so you're in the clear there. So, well, I'll see you around, mate.",JLB
2,2,Mark,Daryl," Yeah, and good riddance, you... you fucking Nazi!",JLB
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," God, you're great.",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Thanks, Jez. You're great, too.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Sometimes, I'd like to die and climb inside you.",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, OK.,Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Was that too much? No. Go on, ask her.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Nancy, I was wondering whether you'd consider being, maybe, my proper, you know, just-you-and-me, girlfriend.",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Wow. Wow, um I don't know. I mean, that's... that's really nice, Jeremy, but-",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"There's always a ""but"".",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Well I mean, I mean we're so different. I've got my religion, my yogacise, my charity stuff. I just don't know where you'd fit in as a boyfriend.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, But I really like you and we have a great time together.,Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Well, I really like you too, and we do have a good time together, but-",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"That's the second ""but"".",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, What about all the other stuff?,Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, Other stuff?,Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Look, obviously God wanted us to enjoy ourselves. I mean, that's why he invented pills, and clubs, and lube and hardcore. But he also wanted us to give something back. And that's why he created the homeless, the lepers and the oil spills.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, suck up to God.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Nancy, listen. The only reason that I don't go to church is that, for me, everything's a church. This room is my church. The hall is my church. Cost Cutter's is a bloody cathedral.",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," That's really nice, Jeremy. It's just not true, is it?",Jez's Room
2,3,Mark,Mark,"End of quarter sales push. Pulling an all-nighter. One of the few in my Spitfire. Who am I kidding? I probably would have crashed my training plane during the Phoney War. Uh-oh, bollocks! Giggling, sharing. Shall I intervene? No. It's fine, it's totally fine. Que sera, sera, whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see. If she fucks him, I'll kill myself.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Security Guys," All right there, mate?",JLB
2,3,Security Guys,Mark, Hi.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Security Guys," Hobnobs. Thought you might like some, mate. You know, pulling an all-nighter, we're all in it together aren't we, mate.",JLB
2,3,Security Guys,Mark, Right.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,Hope this works.,JLB
2,3,Security Guys,Mark," Well, that's nice. Do you want to come in?",JLB

2,3,Mark,Security Guys,"Blimey, mate. Look at all these TVs. You can see it all from in here, can't you?",JLB
2,3,Security Guys,Mark," Yep. So, uh, what's your name, pal?",JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,Pal? Is he a pal person?,JLB
2,3,Mark,Security Guys,"Mark, pal.",JLB
2,3,Security Guys,Security Guys," Ah, Terry. Mark here's brought us some biscuits.",JLB
2,3,Security Guys,Mark," Cheers, mate.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,Now we're back to mate! This is a nightmare.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Security Guys,"No problem, mate, pal. So, I bet I can see my mates from up here, yeah? Oh, yeah, look, there they are, laughing away like a pair of bloody idiots at absolutely nothing.",JLB
2,3,Security Guys,Mark," Your mate's getting fresh, is he?",JLB

2,3,Security Guys,Security Guys," Hey, Tel, get me a tape.",JLB

2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, Nancy!,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, Since when were you involved with street work?,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Since forever. Bloody hell, this is amazing! I had no idea you were into this stuff, too!",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, Really? I'm pretty sure I mentioned it.,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," No, I don't think you did, because if you had, I'd have mentioned it too.",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, Right.,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Yeah, I love hobos. Always have, always will. And they're a great bunch down here, the Jesus Cave Crew.",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Yeah. Although, don't you think sometimes they can be a bit patronising? It's like, ""Sorry we're all out of soup and bread, but oh look, this is lucky, we have lots and lots of wine and tiny little wafers!""",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Yeah, that is so whack! I mean Jesus fed a multitude of followers with just five loaves and two fishes. Matthew, chapter fourteen.",Soup Kitchen

2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," See you later, honey.",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Later, baby!",Soup Kitchen

2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," I'm good, thanks. Boyfriend.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Jeremy,Ah! This is the worst bit. I hate this bit. This is the worst bit.,Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Mark," Come on, mate. There's no point torturing yourself.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Jeremy," It's not torture, it's research! Besides, I have a right to torture myself if I want to. What are you going to do? Call Amnesty? See? That! That's the push! She can't get away. He's some sort of animal. Did you see the push, Jeremy?",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Mark," Yeah, sure, that looked terrible.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy," Looks like a one-off, though, doesn't it? A crazy flash in the pan. Don't you think? I mean, Nancy, you're her friend. Give me your analysis. I mean, did she tell you what happened, after?",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Mark," Well apparently, he took her to the bathroom for a little bit of... but Sophie was totally not into it.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy, Oh.,Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Mark," So they went back to his place, they made out for hours and she jerked him off.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy, Oh.,Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Mark, But then he went away and he hasn't called and she's really pissed off about it.,Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy, Oh! Brilliant.,Living Room
2,3,Johnson,Others, And our ambition should be to kill clients. I mean actually kill them. With our levels of service. So they're dead.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,"She's not going to smile, Jeff. You can't laugh at someone you don't trust. It's like Mum singing the lumberjack song after she had her affair.",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Sophie," So, Aberdeen. I need a couple of experienced credit managers up there for ten days on-site personnel training. I was thinking Sophie and Jeff.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,"No, no, no! Ten days! He can wheedle his way back in in ten days!",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Others," So, unless anyone else has any thoughts, let's wrap up and have a couple of frappuccinos.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," Yes, I have a thought.",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark, Uh-huh.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson, I very much don't think it's a good idea.,JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark," Oh, OK. And why is that?",JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," It's just a hunch, OK? And I always trust my hunches.",JLB
2,3,Jeff,Mark," Thanks, Columbo.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," And, plus, Jeff doesn't have much experience. The 2003 Scottish Consumer Directive, for example.",JLB
2,3,Jeff,Johnson," I really don't think that affects us, Alan.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Jeff," Oh, it doesn't affect us that during the first phone contact we're obliged to set out, without abbreviation, the terms of a standard repayment plan?",JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,"I've shot you, Jeff, with a bullet made of Scottish finance regulations!",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark," So, Mark, would you be prepared to go up there with Sophie if that's the way things panned out?",JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," Yeah, Alan, I suppose I could probably make that.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,Even if I have to cut off all my limbs and crawl to Aberdeen on my tongue.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Jeremy, I can't believe he's wormed his way back in.,Mini-Golf
2,3,Jeremy,Mark," Yeah. Well, his mum was really ill, apparently. That's why he didn't call Sophie.",Mini-Golf
2,3,Mark,Jeremy," Bastard! Perfect alibi. Still, thanks for that heads up on the date, mate. Great to be able to monitor. And if anyone asks, we're just having a lovely innocent picnic!",Mini-Golf
2,3,Jeremy,Mark, Oops. Looks like he's having a bit of trouble with the Humpty. Keeps rolling on out.,Mini-Golf
2,3,Mark,Jeremy," Brilliant. Although, apparently, she finds that amusing. They're laughing, Jez! They're having a good time!",Mini-Golf
2,3,Mark,Mark,"Got to stop it. Throw a snack. Hit him on the head. No. Get them to film it. Build up a library of taped evidence. Right, evidence that I'm an obsessive voyeur.",Mini-Golf
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Bad news, bad news, bad news. Jesus, Jeremy, one bus crash! What about all the buses that made it safely to their destination?",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Yeah. Yeah, this is such bullshit.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy," Yes, I suppose the news should be a dispassionate list of all the events that have occurred the world over during the day. That would be good. Except, of course, it would take forever! That's- that's- that's our picnic! You can't see the kettle chips.",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Mark, Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Bloody hell!,Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Mark, Whose business is it where you do your drinking?,Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy," I wasn't drinking, I was having a picnic! ",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Others,"Hello? Mum, we were having a picnic. Tell Dad it was a picnic. You can't see the crisps! We had three different flavours of crisps! Explain to him. And Scotch eggs! Yeah, no, really, I'm- I'm fine. Listen, I've got to go. Cock knobs!",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Mark," Mark, don't worry. These things, they happen for a reason. It might not seem like there's a plan, but there is a plan.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy," Oh, right. You believe in a god, do you?",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Mark," Yes, I do. And you might find it a comfort at a time when…",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy," Nancy, there's no evidence for God, whereas Ofcom has published guidelines.",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Mark, So does God. It's called the Bible.,Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nancy," Oh, yes, the Bible. And I wonder what the Bible's view is on you doing it in the shower and the garden centre and up the bum. I mean, that's all right, is it, that's in the Bible? Or do you think maybe that's not in the Bible?",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Mark! I'm sure it is in the Bible, somewhere. Probably in Corinthians. There's a load of weird shit in there.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Mark,"Are they staring? They're all staring at the drunk off the news. Yeah, well, fuck them! Me and Sophie are going to. I'll make everything all right in Aberdeen. They're probably not even staring. Just being paranoid, as usual. Oh, fuck!",JLB
2,3,Mark,Others,"All right. Ha-ha. Very funny. Yeah, I can take a joke as well as anyone else, but, if there are any more jokes, I'm taking it to a fucking industrial tribunal, OK?",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark, Mark. Can I have a word?,JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson, Let me explain. It was a picnic. I'm currently speaking to Ofcom.,JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark, Right.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," I mean, we had three flavours of crisps.",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark, Sure.,JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," Good. Well, I'm glad you understand.",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark," Oh, I understand. Totally. Mark, listen. I've been there. I've been to the bottom of the bottle and back to the top.",JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," No, Alan, I-",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark," We're kindred spirits, Mark. Like George W or Alastair Campbell. We want it all and we want it now. And if we're not hitting our targets, we're hitting the bottle. Right?",JLB
2,3,Mark,Johnson," Alan, I'm not an alcoholic.",JLB
2,3,Johnson,Mark," Sure. Sure you're not. That's what I told myself every day for fifteen years. But until you face your demons and put the plug in the jug, how can I trust you to be my main man in the office, let alone Frankfurt? Or Aberdeen?",JLB
2,3,Mark,Mark,"I've got to go to Aberdeen. I've got the Rough Guide! I could always sell it on eBay. No, I've got to go to Aberdeen with Sophie!",JLB
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, Have you found it yet?,Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, Found what?,Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," The bit - you know, the bit where it says it's OK to do it up the bum.",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, I'm not looking for that. I'm just reading.,Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, OK. Sorry. Sorry.,Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Listen, Jez I want to ask you something, if we can do something very special.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,So glad I didn't rub one out in the shower.,Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, I think it's time we break the last taboo.,Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Brilliant. It's not going to hurt, is it? What is it? Is it in the ear?",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Listen. Now, we've done it round every which way there is. I'm just wondering if we shouldn't try not doing it.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, Not doing it?,Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, Yeah. Wouldn't that be amazing?,Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"No. Not amazing. Wrong. Think, brain.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"Yeah. Or, I tell you what, go the other way. Do a John and Yoko. Never stop doing it or get out of bed, until like all the injustice in the world is totally sorted.",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Jeremy, I really want to give this a go. It's a real deal-breaker for me.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Well, then. Let's give it a go. This isn't anything to do with what Mark said, is it?",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," No, of course not.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Because you know he's just the ghost at the feast, don't you?",Jez's Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," I'm so glad you understand. You're great, Jez.",Jez's Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,This is fine. We don't need sex. We can talk. Maybe I can get her to talk dirty while I pull myself off.,Jez's Room
2,3,Mark,Others," Hello. My- my name's Mark and I'm an alcoholic. Er... so, I'm a lager drinker, mainly. I think I had my first one when I was about fourteen. Hofmeister. You remember? The bear with the porkpie hat. Yeah.",AA Meeting
2,3,Mark,Mark,"Surely, that's enough.",AA Meeting
2,3,Johnson,Mark, Let it out.,AA Meeting
2,3,Mark,Others," Yeah, so lately, it's got really bad. I've been on the rum and Coke.",AA Meeting
2,3,Mark,Mark,More?,AA Meeting
2,3,Mark,Others,"And vodka and gin. All mixed up. It's not even a proper cocktail, it's just made-up. And I just drink that and stay at home. And eat oven chips out of the bag, frozen, until I throw up on myself. That's how pissed I've been. Thanks.",AA Meeting
2,3,Mark,Mark,"God, they'll believe anything! All you've got to do is turn up and moan.",AA Meeting
2,3,Johnson,Mark," Thank you, Mark.",AA Meeting
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"What's so great about sex, anyway? It's all in the mind. Her soft skin is just a big bag full of kidneys and mucus and half-digested bits of pie. I bet she's got really nice kidneys. Oh, yeah, I'd fuck those kidneys real good. She looks fine. Why am I not fine and she's fine? She's probably getting some somewhere. Maybe she's doing it with him.",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Others,Jeremy," Excuse me, is there a soup without meat?",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Others," Listen, mate. Beggars can't be choosers, all right?",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, right! Now, they're laughing. What's so bloody hilarious? Right that's it, that is the fucking limit!",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,Hi. What's so funny? What's the big joke?,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, Hey Jez. Shouldn't you be sorting out the queue?,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Why, what are you doing that's so important?",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Oh, I was just helping Nim fill out some benefit forms. God they're a real pain. I'm gonna go and do the soup.",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nim," I know your game. I know what you're up to, Nim.",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nim,Jeremy, What?,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nim," Oh, sure, yeah, you need help filling your forms in ""Ooh, please, Missus, I've been on the streets for so long I've forgotten how to use a pen.""",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Nim,Jeremy, She offered and I just said yes.,Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Nim," Why do you even need them at all? ""Oh, my forms! My precious forms!"" I've got my eye on you, mate.",Soup Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"It's fine, there's nothing to worry about. She's not fucking anyone. We're just sitting watching TV. That's bad body language. She hasn't mentioned that homeless guy once. Probably wants me to forget all about him. That's it, she's off! She's leaving me. Fuck!",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,Where- where are you going?,Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," I just wanted some more juice, you want some?",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, Sure.,Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Relax, play it cool. She loves me. She's not just here because she hasn't got a TV.",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Oh, listen, Jez. I forgot to mention, Nim's going to be moving into my flat.",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," What the fuck?! Nim, the homeless guy?",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Just until he gets his own hostel place. Oh Jesus, Jez! Nothing's gonna happen! He's homeless, Jez. He sleeps rough every night.",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Exactly. He's fine! It's what he does. It's his whole thing! He probably loves it, the rolling hills, the heather. Don't fence him in.",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, It's only until they sort out his claim.,Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Look, this is ridiculous. We've got this massive sofa. Nim should stay here. Yeah, it'll be a laugh. I love the homeless, one of my own would be amazing. I could look after him. Not like a Tamagotchi. Better.",Living Room
2,3,Mark,Others," I'm fine, Dad. Please. There's no need to come and stay. I know it was on the news, but you know what the news is like these days, they just make it all up. No, no, no, no. OK but please don't use that voice. All right. See you at the station.",Flat
2,3,Nim,Mark, Hello.,Living Room
2,3,Mark,Nim, Hello.,Living Room
2,3,Mark,Jeremy,"Jez, there's someone I don't know sitting on the sofa eating my Sara Lee.",Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Mark, He's a good friend of mine called Nim who happens to be homeless.,Kitchen
2,3,Mark,Jeremy," He's not staying here, is he?",Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Mark," Oh, right, I take it you'd prefer to see him out on the street? You know, brush ""them"" away. Hose them down, put them into camps. Is that the idea?",Kitchen
2,3,Mark,Jeremy," No, of course it isn't.",Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Mark," Yes, he's going to stay here, unless you want him to freeze to death, or is that exactly what you want?",Kitchen
2,3,Mark,Jeremy," No! Look, he must have some benefits or something?",Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Mark," As a matter of fact, he doesn't. Some bloody guy ripped up his forms, apparently.",Kitchen
2,3,Mark,Jeremy, Why on earth would they do that?,Kitchen
2,3,Jeremy,Mark," I don't know, Mark. I guess that's just the way life is on the streets.",Kitchen
2,3,Mark,Nim,"Listen, Nim, I feel awful, but, the thing is, my dad's coming to stay and he considers Sir David Frost to be something of a hippie. So you're going to have to leave. I'm sorry. I wouldn't normally do this. I mean, I have a standing order to the Royal National Lifeboat Institute. That's the kind of guy I am. Maybe you can take some comfort from that?",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"God, she's gorgeous! This is killing me. Maybe I can just go and rub myself against her, say I'm doing ""an experiment"". No, too pathetic. OK. Here goes. The nuclear option. The ultimate.",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"So, Nancy. I just wanted to say how much I'm enjoying not having sex with you.",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy, Really?,Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy, Yeah.,Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Come on, Jez, death or glory.",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy,"In fact, I was going to propose that we should probably never have sex again. I mean, all that humping and pumping. We could take all that wasted energy and try and accomplish so many more important things.",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Well, yeah I mean, that's great, Jez, but I really wanted this to bring us, you know, closer together.",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Oh, but it has. I feel incredibly close to you without any pressure to be sexual. I mean, these. I mean, they're just a pair of human breasts, for Christ's sakes. Now I can finally appreciate your whole body without any stupid sexual desire.",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Well, yeah I mean, celibacy, that's great, but maybe it's all just a bit of naughty Nancy. Nancy can't have fun. Nancy must be punished. And maybe I should just say ""Fuck you, Mom!""",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Jeremy,"Oh, yeah! Take that, God! Shove this up your toga, you big beardie killjoy!",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Hey, where's Nim?",Living Room

2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," Jesus, Jeremy! Poor Nim! Where exactly is Nim?",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Oh, Nim, Nim, Nim, Nim, Nim fucking Nim! Look, if you love Nim so much, why don't you go and find him and screw him!",Living Room
2,3,Nancy,Jeremy," OK. Fine. I will go and try and find Nim. You know, just to make sure he's not, like, I don't know, dead or something!",Living Room
2,3,Jeremy,Nancy," Oh, Nancy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Come back! Oh, please? I'm dying here. Just touch it! Blow on it! You can use a tea towel!",Living Room

2,4,Mark,Mark,"Shoes. The boring-est purchase. If only Sophie was here. We could horse around, try on flip-flops and spray suede protector about. Come on Mark, it's Sophie and Jeff now, and that's fine. It's not Armageddon. Come on man, relax, live a little. Could get brown brogues. Best stick to black. Don't want to go completely mental.",Shoe Shop
2,4,April,Mark, Can I help you?,Shoe Shop

2,4,Mark,Mark,"Spiv? Of course, because this is 1942. Come on Mark, she's only a nice girl.",Shoe Shop
2,4,April,Mark," OK, well you better say which ones because... I don't like to recommend... because, this time I recommended some shoes, and the person tried them on and they didn't look good. But I'd recommended them so I said they did, and then they bought them and I felt bad. Sorry, you didn't need to know that.",Shoe Shop
2,4,Mark,April," No it's fine. So I was thinking black, size 8, but broad. I have a broad foot.",Shoe Shop

2,4,Mark,April, No it's fine I just thought they were broad.,Shoe Shop
2,4,Mark,Mark,"Keep feeling my foot, please.",Shoe Shop
2,4,April,Mark," Hey, if we were using ancient Egyptian measurements - which obviously we're not - I'd say it was about a fifth of a cubit, or one hand. Your foot's a hand. Sorry, that's the geekiest joke I've ever heard in my life.",Shoe Shop

2,4,Jeremy,Super Hans, What?,Outside
2,4,Super Hans,Jeremy," Yeah, so obviously I'm gonna have to quit Coming Up For Blair. You can't be in two bands at once. Tom Petty tried that with the Heartbreakers and the Wilburys. Nearly killed the fucking guy.",Outside

2,4,Jeremy,Mark, Right. Well I won't say a word. Good luck with the stalking.,Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Mark,Jeremy, I'm not stalking her.,Dartmouth Student Union

2,4,Jeremy,Mark,It's Pete from the band.,Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Pete,Listen if it's about the amp I'll be happy to pay for any damage.,Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Pete,Jeremy," It's Super Hans. He's pissed a few of the guys off, nicked some booze and stolen a maraca.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Pete," Oh, I can work with just the one, I've seen it done.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Pete,Jeremy," No, see Jez, we need a kind of front man, you know? Someone to hit a few keys on the sequencer, freak out, make a bit of a show. But would you feel weird about bumping Super Hans?",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Pete," No. I mean, yeah. But no, yes, initially, but, I've thought about it and, no I'd feel fine.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Pete,Jeremy," All right, wicked.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Mark,Mark,"How cheap dare I go? Professor MacLeish said party, it's gonna get jumbled in the common lot. I could risk breaking the two ninety-nine barrier! Ha ha. There be monsters! I'll dump this and drink the communal lager. I think I know who's winning.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Others, You couldn't ask Mr Rashid if he's got anything cheaper than this could you?,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Others, OK.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Mark,Fair enough.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark," Hey Mark, look. They've moved the bus stop. Our bloody bus stop's been moved. ",Mr Rashid's

2,4,Jeremy,Mark, And I'm headlining a band.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Others,Jeremy," Excuse me friend, can I see what you've got in your pocket there?",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Others," Why do you want to look- look, I'm not a student, I am a real person.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Others," Mr Rashid don't be ridiculous, it's us remember? The El Dude brothers. You gave us that out-of-date hummus, Jez was really ill, and we laughed about it!",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Others, Who the hell put that there?,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,I can't believe he called the police.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark,"I've got to get out, I'm meant to be on stage any fucking minute!",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy, What the hell were you thinking? Why didn't you just pay for it?,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark," They should be paying us to eat that crap Mark. Stealing things just makes everything very cheap. Plus, you know how I feel about capitalism.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy," Yes, confused.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark," Look Mark, I'm supposed to be on stage right now. I was wondering, maybe you could somehow, take the rap for me. We could say I was in your thrall. Like Hindley.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy, No way Jeremy. Right now April's probably getting chatted up by some student who's also worked out she's got the magical combo of beauty and low self-esteem.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark," OK, OK, here's the plan - good cop, bad cop. I say I'm ill, Mr Rashid comes in all sympathetic, you stand there, hit him gently but firmly until he stops - not, moving - but, resisting. We exit post haste. Yeah?",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy, We murder Mr Rashid. What is it with you and stealing and murdering today? You're mad on it!,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark," Right, come on let's just do it!",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy," No Jeremy! There's procedures, forms, we need to go through the proper channels! All right, all right. Since you're so set on a life of crime, no pointing in adding criminal damage as well.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Mark," Woohoo. Great, cheer up mate. We're outlaws. Out on the lam. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance.",Mr Rashid's
2,4,Mark,Jeremy, I'm gonna leave a tenner and a note.,Mr Rashid's
2,4,Jeremy,Others," Look, I don't need to buy a ticket, I'm in the band. I'm not a punter. I got waylaid, there's been a mix-up. I don't belong here with the shit-munchers. Do I look like a civilian? You are gonna be so embarrassed in about five minutes.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Others," Excuse me! Sorry! I'm in the band! I'm in the band, excuse me, sorry, sorry. Excuse me, I'm in the band, I need to get up on the stage, I'm in the band!",Dartmouth Student Union

2,4,Jeremy,Jeremy,Crowd-pleaser.,Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Others," Let's do it, let's 'ave it! Let's have some more of it!",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Others," Look, I'm in the band. You don't believe me. That's hilarious.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Jeremy,Others," That's not hilarious because that's my bollock. Yep, you've got my bollock. You're pulling on my bollock.",Dartmouth Student Union
2,4,Mark,MacLeish," I was like, yeah the book's based on good source material, unfortunately the source material appears to be Asterix The Gaul!",MacLeish's Place
2,4,MacLeish,Mark," Ha ha ha ha. So Mark I was wondering if you'd fancy doing a little piece for Rhombus? Five hundred words or so, kicking the shit out of Simon Schama.",MacLeish's Place

2,4,MacLeish,Jeremy," All I can say is I spend my free time reading, rather than sitting around watching Ghostbusters.",MacLeish's Place
2,4,Jeremy,MacLeish," And what exactly is the problem with Ghostbusters? Oh, oh, look how many books I've got. I must be clever. Yeah well let's have a look at some of these books, yeah? Let's see how really great they are.",MacLeish's Place

2,4,Mark,Jeremy, Tell them what? That I'm a hard-working mature student?,MacLeish's Place
2,4,Jeremy,Mark," He's not a mature student. He's been a loan manager for the last five years. He lives with me and he eats ready meals, and we play ""Guess the Revels"" and we watch Men In Black in front of our massive telly and we have a fucking good time.",MacLeish's Place

2,4,April,Mark, So which one's your dorm?,April's Dorm
2,4,Mark,April," Keyser Söze Hall. Do you know it? Very ugly, horribly ugly, it's for mature students. They try and lock us all away in case we infect you with our diligence and lust for knowledge.",April's Dorm
2,4,Mark,Mark,"OK, dangerously close to getting what I want. Feels a bit weird. Don't think about Sophie.",April's Dorm
2,4,Mark,April,Love your room.,April's Dorm
2,4,April,Mark, Thanks. It's your basic undergraduate lunge for individuality. I've not even seen Betty Blue. Have you?,April's Dorm
2,4,Mark,April, Oh yeah. Great sex-and-suicide flick. Turned a whole generation of men onto girls with mental illness.,April's Dorm
2,4,April,Mark, OK.,April's Dorm
2,4,Mark,Mark,"Perfect. The kind of scenario that used to terrify me, but now I can totally handle. Just lean in, or pull her towards me and just simply- this is my chance! And I'm doing nothing, I am now, this instant, missing my chance.",April's Dorm

2,5,Mark,Sophie, Oh?,JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark," It's just, well, the thing is, Jeff's asked, said actually. He thinks you and I should see less of each other. He's sort of old fashioned that way.",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie," Old fashioned? Right, what's next? Put you in a chastity belt and make you... drive around in an old fashioned car?",JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark," I'd really like to give it a go with Jeff. And, he's going to move in with me for a couple of months. See if that helps.",JLB
2,5,Mark,Sophie, Move in? That won't help! What about giving him some space? That might help!,JLB
2,5,Sophie,Mark," I'm really sorry, Mark.",JLB

2,5,Mark,Jeremy," What? six-thirty just like normal. Look, you said it was urgent, Jeremy!",JLB

2,5,Mark,Mark,"OK, going undercover. Jeff's apparent mate, who couldn't possibly be trying to nick his bird from right under his stupid old fashioned nose. Mmm, OK, man-chat topics. Footballer Darren Anderton, figure of ridicule due to repeated injuries. Turkish shepherd, ate his own testicles. NB, ignore tragic earthquake context. Ferrari Testarossa, fast car. Obviously, no need to note that. Shit, I'm making too many notes! Just imbibe the culture. Um, yes. Civilisation is definitely doomed.",Mark's Room

2,5,Jeff,Mark, Right.,Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff," Plus, I thought it would be good to hang out a bit. 'Cause basically, you know, you're a bloke, I'm a bloke. We're both bloody good blokes. Unlike that idiotic Turkish shepherd who chewed off his own knackers. Did you see that?",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark," Er, no, I don't think so.",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff, Bloody shithead. Yes! Mark the Shark is in business!,Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark," You're stripes, Mark.",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff," Oh, yes, right. You play that, do you? Of course. So, FHM have only gone and done a bloody sex issue. Did you see that? Loads of birds, foil bag, the whole caboodle. Carmen Electra's in there. I would seriously love to really, really bang her. Although, if it was a choice between that and a drive in a Ferrari Testarossa, phew! Too close to call, yeah?",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark," So you've give up trying to hump Soph then, have you?",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff, Pardon?,Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Mark, I said you've given up trying to-,Pool Hall

2,5,Jeremy,Mark," Hey, Marky Mark!",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeremy," Hey, Jez.",Pool Hall

2,5,Jeremy,Mark, Jeff's?,Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeremy," He's in the bog. But, the thing is, it's currently going a bit terribly, but it's really important that I make friends with him. So, I thought, you're more of a fun sort of guy than me.",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Mark," What, so I'm the fluffer? Is that it?",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeremy," No, it's not like that. Look, if I don't make friends with Jeff, there's a very good chance I'll never speak to Sophie probably ever again.",Pool Hall
2,5,Mark,Jeff,Oh! Hi Jeff! You remember Jeremy.,Pool Hall
2,5,Jeremy,Jeff," Oh, nice to see you, mate. Yeah, how's it going? Oh, fantastic trainers!",Pool Hall
2,5,Jeff,Jeremy," Cheers, mate!",Pool Hall

2,5,Jeff,Mark," Oh, well, actually, I just had a call from a mate. He's got a poker school about to start over at his place. If you're interested in losing a bit of money, we could always manage a fresh face.",Pool Hall
