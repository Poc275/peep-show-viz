        "Mark has more lines than Jez. This is the case throughout each series which was a surprise as I considered it around 50/50 when I watched the show. Mark has around twice the amount of \"internal thoughts\" than Jez. Again this is the case throughout each series. The TV is classed as a character in series one as Mark & Jez converse with it a lot, even to the point of letting it decide (via Bob Ross) if Mark should proclaim his love for Soph or not. This is a theme which didn't really occur again in later series. Series one has the fewest number of lines out of all the other series.",
        "Series 2 has the fewest number of interactions between Mark and Jez out of all the other series. Jez has the fewest number of \"internal thoughts\" in this series. It also introduces us to April who only appears in a single episode but reappears for the final series. Nancy also appears for the first time. This is the series where we see the most of Jeff as the love triangle between him, Mark and Soph intensifies.",
        "This series is the closest Jez comes to having more lines than Mark. Mark has the fewest number of \"internal thoughts\" in this series. Although mentioned previously, this series is where we see Big Suze for the first time. We also see Big Mad Andy who gladly reappears in later series. Mark and Soph have a lot of lines together as this is the series that culminates in the inadvertent wedding proposal.",
        "This is the series that has the most characters and it includes some truly memorable ones: Russell \"The Orgazoid\", Matt the personal trainer (who for the record doesn't poo in pools), that dickhead Foz and it's the first appearance of Gerrard. Nancy also reappears after missing series three. This, sadly, is the series in which Super Hans appears the least, he only has 17 lines.",
        "This series is the first appearance of Dobby as Mark tries to move on from his disastrous wedding. We also meet Paula, Toni's sister, again who last appeared in the very first episode.",
        "Interestingly, Mark speaks to himself more than Jez in this series, the only time this happens. This is probably because Jez is too busy being infatuated with Elena. This is the series with the biggest discrepancy between the number of lines spoken by Mark (42%) and Jez (26%). Super Hans actually talks to Mark more than Jez in this series which continues his development in becoming the \"third\" character as Soph's involvement becomes less and less as the series progress.",
        "This is the series where we see the most of Gerrard as he and Mark battle it out to be leader of Dobby club. We also have a lot of medical characters as the series starts with the birth of Mark and Sophie's child. We briefly meet Dobby's boyfriend Simon for the first time who'll reappear in the next series. Memorably we also meet Mark's parents for the first time. This is the last series in which Big Suze appears.",
        "In this series we see a lot of interactions between Jez and Dobby as Jez falls in love with her. Jez also has the most number of \"internal thoughts\" compared to other series as he agonises over the fact that he loves Dobby but doesn't want to hurt Mark. Unbelievably, Johnson only has a single, solitary line. But what a line, we'll investigate this later. Big Mad Andy is back and is in desperate need of therapy but Jez's questionable life-coaching will have to suffice. Joshy, Mark's nephew is also included. Although he only has two lines I just wanted to include him sitting on a display toilet as it's hilarious. This is the only series where Soph doesn't appear. Props also to Dave Franks who after being hustled by Mark and Jez into buying bath taps (that almost certainly are not the same ones that Mark Ronson has) he promises not to snitch to Mark's boss, jumpstarts Jez's car and keeps his promise even after finding a child-size poo in one of his display toilets. Also, we can't leave without mentioning that this is the series where Gerrard passes away, and no, it isn't bullshit.",
        "The final series has the most lines but the fewest number of characters out of all the other series. This is the series in which Mark and Jez converse with each other the most. April reappears after last appearing in series two. Dobby has the fewest amount of lines in this series as she moves on from \"just sitting on the sofa watching DVDs and eating lamb pasanda like a pair of zombies\". Super Hans has the most lines in this series than any other."

        "Mark and Jez start out with similar aims of sleeping with their next-door neighbour Toni. Jez does this, while she is separating from her husband, Tony. Mark is obsessed with his colleague Sophie, who is more interested in their manly colleague Jeff. Mark has a one-night stand with a teenage goth girl. Mark and Jez endure awkward situations: Mark admires his boss, Alan Johnson, and struggles to work out whether or not he is sexually attracted to him. Jez remembers engaging in fellatio with Super Hans during a drug binge. Sophie beats Mark to a promotion, so Mark and Jez desperately team up to prank call Sophie, which leads to her shooting them with a pellet gun. They also launch a pepper spray attack on Super Hans, who has begun a fling with Toni. Mark sees a therapist, and nearly succeeds in having sex with Sophie, but this chance is ruined by Jez's apparent drug overdose. Shortly afterwards, Jez claims to Toni that he has a terminal illness in order to persuade her to have sex with him.",
        "Tony moves back in with Toni. Super Hans develops a crack cocaine addiction. Jez meets, falls in love with and starts an open relationship with Nancy, an attractive and happy-go-lucky American. They briefly enjoy a wild sex life, but Nancy then decides to become celibate. Jez briefly appears to be having some success with his music career with Super Hans. Mark's life is falling apart, as Sophie plans to move in with Jeff. Mark forges a brief friendship with a colleague, Daryl, which he ends after he discovers that Daryl is a neo-Nazi. Mark falls for a shy, attractive student in a shoe shop and makes an ill-judged visit to his old university, Dartmouth, where she studies. Mark finds out from Jez that Jeff has been cheating on Sophie, and Mark informs Sophie of that, after which Sophie ends the relationship. Nancy asks Jez to marry her, for visa reasons, and Jez accepts gleefully; Mark gets Super Hans to lie to Jez and say that she had sex with him, but after they see his reaction they cannot go through with it. Jez and Nancy do get married despite Mark's efforts, but after they decide to start having sex again Jez admits to Nancy, who is now his wife, that he hooked up with Toni. Nancy leaves him.",
        "The series begins with Jez in a relationship with Michelle, of whom he is not fond but with whom he stays as they plan a threesome with another woman. Big Suze re-enters Jez's life, and has a new boyfriend, Stu. Mark and Sophie have finally become a couple, but Mark is mugged and is separated from Sophie once again when their employer relocates her to Bristol. Merry, Jez and Mark's friend from university, visits and Mark arranges for her to be sectioned. Jez and Super Hans attempt to run a pub. Jez holds a magic mushroom party in the flat. Jez has a fling with Mark's sister, while Mark falls in love with Suze. Jez serves on a jury and has a date with the female defendant. In the last episode, Mark plans to propose to Sophie but changes his mind upon realising that they have nothing in common. Nonetheless he agrees to marry her to avoid \"embarrassment\" after she accidentally finds his engagement ring and accepts a proposal which he had not actually made. Jez's efforts to get back together with Suze are hindered somewhat by Hans's attempts to go cold turkey.",
        "During this series, recently engaged Mark and Sophie visit Sophie's parents, and Jez has sex with Sophie's mother. Big Suze breaks up with Jez once again after Johnson offers to pay him in order to have sex with her and he agrees. Despite being disgusted by the offer, she subsequently starts a relationship with Johnson claiming that he is an \"alpha male\". Mark's attempt, at Johnson's request, to head a group of staff to formulate a merger between two departments is a failure, which leads to Mark being humiliated at JLB's conference. In an attempt to get away from Sophie, Mark joins a gym and discovers that Nancy is working there, after which Jez makes a failed attempt to reconcile. Sophie leaves on a business trip to Frankfurt, leaving Mark to consider a fling with a woman whom he recently met at his school reunion. Jez finds some well-paid work as a handyman for \"The Orgazoid\", one of his musical heroes, but discovers that his new employer expects him to give him \"a hand\". Mark and Jeremy spend a weekend on a narrowboat in Shropshire for Mark's stag do, at which Mark and Jez meet two sisters in a pub. After meeting the businessman father of the girls, Mark attempts to secure a job with him in Bangalore as a means of escaping his impending wedding. The plan backfires when Jez accidentally kills the pet dog of one of the girls and the family find out when a series of attempts to cover it up lead to him eating it. As the wedding approaches, Jez is having difficulty juggling a hungover Super Hans, the wedding, Nancy, and his desperate need to urinate. After several attempts to avoid marrying, including proposing marriage to a member of staff in a local cafe, stepping out in front of a car, and hiding in the church, Mark, with visible reluctance, marries Sophie. However, realising he was trying to get out of marrying her by hiding, she runs out on him after the ceremony, planning to seek an annulment because Mark is \"horrible\".",
        "Much of the series revolves around Mark's search for \"the one\". His first date since his wedding is a double date which goes wrong due to going to a boring play, his date being uninterested in him and then returning to the house to find a burglar. He asks out the IT girl, Dobby, although the date ends badly when they find a vomiting Sophie in the toilets, who reveals to Dobby that she is married to him. Dobby remains interested, even when Mark rejects her offer to be his date at his upcoming birthday party to take a young Australian woman whom he had recently met whilst speed dating. Jez runs out of money and steals from Johnson's credit card and is temporarily evicted by Mark. Jez asks Big Suze if he can stay with her and Johnson, but is rejected. He tries to obtain money from his mother after his great aunt dies, which reveals their strained relationship. Mark, however, thrives in her company and is given the job of writing her boyfriend's military biography. Angry, Jeremy ruins Mark's ambitions by revealing how Mark was raped by the veteran's daughter, which she had initiated while he was asleep. Jeremy and Hans get a manager, Cally, for their band and go to a music festival. Jez and Mark both have sex with Cally, but she quickly rejects both of them. Mark fails to ask Dobby out and she finally moves on. Jez and Hans join a cult. Mark is promoted to Senior Credit Manager by Johnson but does not fire Sophie as ordered, after she reveals that she is pregnant with what may be his child. In the closing moments of the series, Jez tells Mark that he recently had sex with Sophie and that her baby might be his.",
        "The series begins with JLB Credit closing down. Sophie tells Mark and Jez that Jeff is also a possible father of her baby. The mystery is solved when Sophie reveals that Mark is the baby's father. Jez meets Elena, a beautiful young European woman and occasional marijuana dealer who lives in their building. Jeremy quickly falls in love with her, but things deteriorate when it is revealed that Elena has a long-term partner, Gail, who is returning to London. Mark looks for work, starting a company with an ill-equipped Johnson, almost landing his dream job as a guide for historic walks, then becoming a waiter in Gail's Mexican restaurant—all the while trying to get anywhere with Dobby. To resolve their woman troubles, Jeremy and Mark host a party, which ends in Jeremy trying to rekindle his love for Elena, Mark failing to win over Dobbie, and Gail and Elena deciding to enter into a civil partnership. Mark pledges to take driving lessons in order to drive Sophie to the hospital when the baby arrives, but lies to her when he fails his test. Jeremy is upset over losing Elena, especially after she reveals that she is moving to Quebec with Gail. Sophie goes into labour early, and with Mark forced to reveal he cannot drive, a drunk Jeremy attempts to drive Sophie to the hospital and nearly runs Gail over. Jeremy admits that he and Elena were having an affair, then Sophie drives herself to the hospital with the two boys in the back seat.",
        "Zahra and her boyfriend Ben are introduced, whom Jez meets while Sophie is giving birth. Jez is instantly attracted to Zahra and is selfishly pleased when he discovers that Ben is in a coma, potentially making Zahra single. However, Ben recovers fully, and, as thanks for being so friendly to Zahra, offers Jez a job with his record company, which Jez accepts as he hopes it will allow him to get closer to Zahra. The job does not go well, and his attempts to sign up his and Super Hans's band fails badly and ends up with him being fired from the band. Mark finally beats off competition from Gerard to become Dobby's boyfriend, although he continues to behave awkwardly in her company. Gail sacks Mark from his job at the restaurant. Jez pretends to be an intellectual in order to impress Zahra, which enables him to have sex with her. When Mark comes to meet him the next morning the two find themselves locked in Zahra's flat, causing Ben to discover them and Mark to miss his son's christening. Jez, Hans, Dobby, Mark, Mark's sister and parents all have Christmas dinner at Jez and Mark's. After Zahra tells Jez that she has split from Ben, Jez accepts her offer to move in with her. Mark needs to salvage his relationship with Dobby, and asks her to move in with him, to which she agrees. Zahra rejects Jez after she learns he has been flirting with Super Hans's girlfriend, dumping him.",
        "The series begins with Mark waiting for Dobby to move in, while Dobby waits for Jez to move out. Mark suspects that Dobby will never move in, and that Gerard is trying to steal her from him; however, Gerard dies of flu. Jez and Super Hans amicably end their band, and this causes Jez to contemplate his life so far: he eventually agrees to undertake therapy sessions, which are paid for by Mark. Impressed by the therapy, Jez decides to become a life coach, but he fails a course of questionable value. Mark then gives Jez a fake life coach certificate and he begins \"coaching\" anyone who will let him, causing emotional and personal harm. Mark writes a book, which is published by an incompetent vanity publisher. Mark, Dobby, Jez and Hans go paintballing. Mark gets a job at the bathroom supplies company where Hans works, but is soon sacked. He also starts an evening course to gain an MBA. Jez falls in love with Dobby and declares his feelings, as does Mark. While Mark and Jez fight, Dobby leaves the scene and heads to New York, where she has a new job.",
        "The final series opens with Mark and Jez meeting for the first time since their fight over Dobby, with Mark still bearing a grudge over the role Jez played in his break-up with her. Jez is living in Super Hans's bathroom, while Mark has a new flatmate. After reconciling, Jez moves back in with Mark and they go back to their old ways. Jez begins a relationship with a younger man, Joe, and also has sex with Joe's girlfriend Megan. Mark seeks out April (previously seen only in a single episode in series 2), whom he always thought to be his perfect woman, despite her now being married. Dobby has moved to New York and has a new boyfriend. He beats up Mark when he discovers Mark had been tracking Dobby's movements. Hans marries Molly in Norfolk. Sophie turns up at the flat depressed and appears to have a drink problem. She is in a relationship with a man whom she thinks is having an affair. She offers Mark a chance to give their relationship another go, which he initially accepts, but Mark decides to try and break up April's marriage and start a new life with her. In the final episode, all the duo's past lies and selfish decisions catch up with them. Mark loses his job at a bank because of a loan he gave Jez previously (ironically, to exploit him) without asking for correct identification paperwork, and he is replaced by his rival Jeff. Joe leaves Jez after his lies about him being popular and young are caught out, and Jez claims he is tired of partying all the time. Super Hans's wife is upset because he is unwilling to stop his old disreputable lifestyle, and after he kidnaps and threatens April's husband, she finally leaves him. Super Hans ends up leaving for Macedonia to open a moped hire business and leaves Mark and Jez right back where they always end up due to their bad choices, with Mark losing his newest relationship and job, while Jez remains stuck in a rut with no prospects. It ends with the two watching TV together, asking and answering inane questions, with Jez thinking to himself how they both \"love each other really\" and Mark reminding himself that he \"simply must get rid of him\".",
