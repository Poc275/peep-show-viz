Words such as maybe, fine, nice and sure do not come across as very assertive which I think reflects the internal conflict between Mark and Jez's inner thoughts and what comes out of their mouths. There's also no surprise that a curse word found its way into the top list but we'll look more into this later.",

We see the re-appearance of a curse word for the first time since the first series. This is probably due to the wedding fiasco.",
