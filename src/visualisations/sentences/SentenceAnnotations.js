            "Cancer is mentioned a lot during episode 1 as an argument ensues over the doctor's name for Toni's sister.

Daryl the racist is prominent in Mark's words from episode 2. This is the same episode where Jez is trying to do the track for Gog's film. Jeff appears at the top of Mark's words on two occasions as he begins to plot his way into breaking up his and Soph's relationship. Jeff also appears in Jez's top words from episode 5 as they form a brief friendship. Student is mentioned by Mark and Jez in episode 4 as they both venture off to Darty, Jez to play a gig (not like Bez) and Mark to stalk April from the shoe shop.",

This series shows a big increase in average sentence lengths compared with the first two series. It even goes up to 9 words per sentence for Mark during the final episode as he grapples with the prospect of proposing to Soph.",
            "We see that Mark continues to have the more internal lines compared to Jez, although Jez has more this series than in series 2 despite the lack of internal thoughts in episode 2. This is probably because of his constant bickering with Super Hans over the name of the pub...",
            "This is the series where we meet Big Suze for the first time. You can see from Jez's top words how besotted he his with her. Mark also mentions her a lot in episode 4 when they spend time together. Mark's words in episode 1 reflect his mildly harrowing experience at the hands of the muggers. Merry is mentioned a lot by both in episode 2 as they prove no help at all with her spiralling mental state. Illness is a theme in episode 3 as Jez locks the sick man of Europe in his room so as not to dampen his mushroom party. There's a legal theme for Jez in episode 5 for obvious reasons and Mark frets about the hotel in the Quantocks in the final episode as this is where he pops the question to Soph, albeit inadvertently."

            "As usual, Mark has the more internal lines than Jez although during episode 6, \"The Wedding\", they both have fewer internal lines. This is surprising as usually the more stressful the situation is, the more \"internal thoughts\" the characters have as they fret over the situation. Perhaps because Mark and Jez are together the whole time meant they were sounding off each other as opposed to internalising their neuroses.",
            "Jez has some strange words. We see \"Finger\" and \"Blair\" in episode 1 as Sophie's Mum tempts him with some \"Blair resignation jam\". Russell, episode 4, is Russell \"The Orgazoid\", one of the most brilliant techno pioneers of all time who Jez gives a \"hand\" to from time to time. \"Dog\", \"Turkey\" and \"Mummy\" in episode 5 reflect the horror that is Jez killing, attempting to dispose of, barbecuing and finally eating, a dog. The less said about \"Melon\" in episode 6 the better. Mark's words are a bit more conventional. We see him struggling with Project Zeus during episode 2, Johnson's unworkable plan where Marketing becomes an arm of Sales which Mark has to pitch to the JLB board. Episode 3 is where Mark joins a gym. \"Foz\" in episode 4 is the dickhead who used to bully Mark at school."

The longest average is Mark's during episode 3, this could be due to him attempting to turn on the charm during his disastrous speed dating encounter.",
            "Again we see Mark having the more internal lines than Jez. Jez starts with very few but it does increase slightly as the series progresses. Mark actually has closer to a 50/50 split compared to previous series as he grapples with finding \"the one\", how to defeat Sophie in the post-jilting spin war, controlling Jeremy's finances, trying to ignore crystal skulls and contemplating becoming a father.",
            "\"Date\" is mentioned by both during episode 1 as they venture on a double date to get Mark back in the game. The presence of the word \"Police\" indicates how that went. We see Mark mention Dobby in episode 2 as this is the series we meet her for the first time. \"Elgar\" refers to the composer Edward Elgar. Not that Jez turns to classical music, he's simply broke and Elgar appears on the back of a Â£20 note. \"Gun\" is mentioned by both in episode 4 as they find Jez's great-aunt's revolver which they christen \"gunny\". Finally, \"Orgones\" in the final episode refers to Jez joining a cult which according to them are the \"invisible molecules of universal life energy which govern our moods and our actions\"."

            "As per previous series, Mark has more internal lines than Jez. Jez has very few internal lines during the first episode, probably because he's too busy bemoaning the loss of employment at JLB after his half a day's service to anyone that will listen.",

Episode 1 is where JLB closes which we can see is Mark's top word. \"Dobby\" is mentioned a lot by Mark as he tries to win her over. Jeremy mentions Elena and Gail a lot as his dirty love triangle develops.

            "Mark edges the amount of internal lines compared to Jez, but Jez does have more than previous series (in fact this is one of the very few series which has episodes in which Jez has more lines than Mark, see episodes 3 and 4). Episode 4 reduces his ratio a lot but this is the same for Mark as well. I guess being stuck in the \"Nether Zone\" together limits the internal thoughts each had, taking out their frustration on each other instead.",
            "We can see Mark's top words are baby themed as this is the series his son is born. He also talks about Dobby a lot as the battle for leader of Dobby club with Gerrard heats up. \"Book\" is the top word of both characters in episode 3 as Jez tries to read a \"relatively short book\" to impress Zahra's book group which Mark ends up reading for him. \"Kenneth\" may seem an odd word, bonus points if you remember what that refers to, I'd rather not say. \"Ben\" dominates Jez's top words as he obsesses over getting rid of him to be with Zahra. \"Suit\" is mentioned a fair bit in episode 2 as he tries to get Super Hans' band to perform in Zoot suits as a deal breaker to sign them to Ben's label. The top words are rounded off with Christmas and \"Party\" type words as the series ends with Christmas dinner and a failure to party hard on New Year's Eve.",

            "Jez really competes with Mark in this series for internal lines. In the final episodes he's almost equal as he agonises over the decision to come clean about his love for Dobby. Episode 3 is surprising in that Mark nearly has a 50/50 split internal to external what with fretting over Dobby moving in and trying to avoid being hit by \"The Snitch\" during paintballing.",

Episode 3's words look odd at first glance until you remember this is the episode with the famous band name game. We can see \"Committee\" in episode 5 as Mark \"The Honourable Man\" launches a putsch to take over as chairman of the housing committee. Finally we see \"York\" in the final episode which refers to Dobby's impending move to New York. Jez's words are dominated by his career move into life coaching and in the later episodes we can see \"Dobby\" appearing as he falls in love with her and frets over whether to come clean to Mark.",

Maybe this is due to him grappling with the prospect of middle age whilst trying to maintain a love triangle.",
            "The final series is no different in that Mark has more internal lines than Jez. Jez's internal thoughts diminish quite a lot towards the end of the series. Maybe this marks the end of Jez's youth and he begins middle age and leaves his partying life behind.",
            "You'll notice \"Jerry\" mentioned by both characters during the first episode. This isn't a typo for Jeremy, it is Mark's new cultured flatmate who Jez tries to get kicked out. \"Joe\" is one of Jez's top words throughout the series as he begins a relationship with both him and his girlfriend Megan. \"Bank\" is mentioned by both at points in the series as Mark begins his new job and Jez becomes an accomplice in robbing it. \"Dobby\" reappears just for the second episode but Mark finally moves on to his old crush, April. There's just the small problem of her being married, see \"Angus\" in episode 4.",

It's been a long road and now, as you've found Molly, er, and I don't really want to get into this, but I've started it now, but I'm going to bring it round, so don't worry. People said Molly wasn't right for you. That she was a downer. But you know what? If someone loves someone, he just loves them. And if that person is considered to be a downer, or even a yawn-a-thon, who cares? And even if someone loves another man, or, what's in a name? Or gender? Is it possible to love two people at once? Three? Four is surely the limit. But is it? What is love anyway? Is it, er, an act, or a feeling or, who am I to speak? Who are you to listen? Why is a marriage a marriage? But society says it's wrong for two men to love one another even though now it says it says that now it's OK? Is it OK because society says it's OK? What next? Dogs getting married? Could I marry my own son? No. Possibly not? Correct. Or is it? What I'm trying to say is that people should do whatever they want to do, at a temperature that suits them, within limits. Thank you.",
